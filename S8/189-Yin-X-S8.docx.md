<p style="text-align:justify">Methylmercury (MeHg) is a pervasive and ubiquitous environmental toxin
that endangers human health worldwide. Certain anaerobic microorganisms,
such as the sulfate-reducing bacterium <i>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans</i>
ND132 and iron-reducing bacterium <i>Geobacter sulfurreducens</i> PCA, are
known to convert inorganic mercury to MeHg in natural environments.
However, a small group of methanotrophs such as <i>Methylosinus
trichoorium</i> OB3b has recently been shown to degrade MeHg by as yet an
uncharacterized mechanism, in which methanobactin (MB) (a metal-binding
thiol compound excreted by OB3b) plays an essential role. Here, we
examined the opposite effects of MB on the biosynthesis of MeHg by <i>D.
desulfuricans</i> ND132 and <i>G. sulfurreducens</i> PCA in laboratory culture
studies since the thiol compound is also known to impact microbial
methylation. Surprisingly, MB was found to greatly enhance both the
rates and efficiency of MeHg production by ND132 and PCA. Compared to
the cultures without MB, the methylation rate increased by 6-7 times,
and &gt; 90% of the added Hg(II) (25 nM) was converted to MeHg in 72 h
by <i>D. desulfuricans</i> ND132. Mercury speciation analyses indicate that
MB likely formed strong complexes with Hg(II) in solution and thus
increased the bioavailability of Hg(II) for cell methylation. While the
exact mechanism of MB-enhanced mercury methylation remains to be
investigated, this study provides new considerations of complex
environmental factors, such as the presence of novel exogenous
thiol-containing ligands, in mercury methylation and demethylation in
the environment.

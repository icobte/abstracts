<p style="text-align:justify">Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant and can be methylated to form
neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg), which can bioaccumulate and biomagnify
in food webs. In natural fresh water and sediments, Hg is largely
associated with particulate minerals and organics. However, it remains
unclear under what conditions these particulates may become a sink or a
source for Hg, and whether the particulate-bound Hg is available for
microbial uptake and methylation. In this study, we investigated Hg
sorption-desorption kinetics and thermodynamics and evaluated the
potential of particulate-bound Hg for microbial methylation using a
Hg-contaminated soil sediment and organic-coated hematite particles in
laboratory microcosms. Mercury was found to strongly and rapidly sorb
onto particulates, especially the cysteine-coated hematite and the soil
sediment. Hg desorption from particulates was low (0–4%). However, the
presence of Hg-binding ligands, such as low-molecular-weight thiols and
humic acid, caused up to 60% of Hg desorption from the Hg-laden hematite
particles, but &lt; 6% from the sediment. Interestingly, the
particulate-bound Hg was found to be bioavailable for uptake and
methylation by a sulfate-reducing bacterium, <i>Desulfovibrio
desulfuricans</i> ND132, and the methylation rate was 4–10 times higher
than the desorption rate of Hg under anaerobic incubations. These
results suggest direct interactions between bacterial cells and the
particulate-bound Hg, resulting in rapid exchange and/or uptake of Hg by
the bacteria. The present study thus highlights the importance of Hg
partitioning at particulate-water interfaces and the role of
particulate-associated Hg as a significant source for microbial
methylation in the environment.

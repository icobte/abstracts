<p style="text-align:justify">The mercury-contaminated wastewater from the chloralkali and battery
industries seriously threatens aquatic ecosystems and must be treated
before discharge. Theoretically, sulfidogenic process is an ideal
bio-technology for low-cost treatment of Hg-contaminated wastewater
because the biogenic sulfide can precipitate Hg(II) to form a safe
byproduct – insoluble HgS (K<sub>sp</sub>= 10<sup>-36</sup> at 20 °C). However, most
sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can methylate Hg(II) to form neurotoxic
methylmercury (MeHg) that accumulates in aquatic food webs, resulting in
severe health hazards for human beings. Thus, conventional sulfidogenic
processes driven by SRB are not suitable for mercury-contaminated
wastewater treatment.

<p style="text-align:justify">In this study, we observed a novel finding that the long-term feeding of
elemental sulfur for the cultivation of a sulfate-reducing bacteria
(SRB)-abundant seeding sludge, eliminated the mercury methylation
potential but kept the sulfidogenic activities remained, with the
enrichment of sulfur-reducing bacteria (S<sup>0</sup>RB) in the final microbial
community. During the 6-month cultivation of S<sup>0</sup>RB from the
SRB-abundant seeding sludge, the methylation capability of the
S<sup>0</sup>RB-enriching sludge gradually diminished to a negligible level. When
exposed to 5 mg/L Hg<sup>2+</sup>, no MeHg was produced
(&lt;limit of detection, 0.01 μg/L) in the S<sup>0</sup>RB-enriched sludge that
cultivated for 6 months, while 1.49 μg/L MeHg accumulated in the
SRB-enriched sludge. This finding was reproduced with a replicated
cultivation work with a different seeding sludge, and the similar
results were obtained.

<p style="text-align:justify">The sulfide production rate of the S<sup>0</sup>RB-enriched sludge and
SRB-enriched sludge were 15.3 and 6.3 mgS/gVSS/h, respectively, showing
that the long-term S<sup>0</sup> feeding promoted the sulfidogenic activity.
However, S<sup>0</sup> feeding altered the microbial community, suppressed the
growth of SRB and enriched S<sup>0</sup>RB, such as <i>Geobacter,<i>
<i>Sulfurospirillum</i> and <i>Pseudomonas.</i>

<p style="text-align:justify">Interestingly, <i>Geobacter</i> that was identified as a known
mercury-methylating genus, was the dominant genus in the S<sup>0</sup>RB-enriched
sludge, and its relative abundance increased with the cultivation time.
This is an unexpectedly finding, implying that the methylation ability
of <i>Geobacter</i> could be hindered in the sulfur reduction system.

<p style="text-align:justify">Finally, we developed a biological sulfur reduction process driven by
S<sup>0</sup>RB for mercury-contaminated wastewater, and investigated its
long-term performance on mercury removal and MeHg accumulation.
Receiving Hg-contaminated wastewater containing 0 – 50 mg Hg(II)/L for
326 days, S<sup>0</sup>RB in the sulfur reduction bioreactor removed 99.4%±1.4%
of the influent Hg(II) by biogenic sulfide. MeHg was always found to be
undetectable in the bioreactor, showing that the cultivated S<sup>0</sup>RB could
be used for mercury-contaminated wastewater treatment without MeHg
concern.

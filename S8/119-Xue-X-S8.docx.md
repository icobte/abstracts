<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenosugars are arsenic-containing ribosides and natural constituents
of marine organisms and not toxic to marine plants or animals. Thus the
synthesis of arsenosguars represents a mechanism of arsenic
detoxification. Arsenosugars also appear to play a central role in the
pathway of arsenic biotransformation in marine systems. First, they are
likely intermediates in the biosynthesis of the osmolyte arsenobetaine,
which is the dominant arsenical in marine organisms and is nontoxic in
humans. Second, arsenosugars are also the likely precursors of
arsenosugar phospholipids, which may be components of the algal cell
membrane. Incorporation of arsenolipids increases under low phosphate
conditions and may represent a phosphate-sparing mechanism under those
conditions. Arsenosugars were identified more than thirty years ago, and
yet their mechanism of biosynthesis remains unknown.
S-Adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM) from <i>Synechocystis</i> sp.
PCC 6803 was found to catalyze the formation of a number of methylated
intermediates from As(III). However, no direct evidence had been
reported to indicate that ArsM was required for arsenosugar
biosynthesis. In this study we report identification of the <i>arsM</i> and
<i>arsS</i> genes from the cyanobacterium <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 and
show that they are involved in arsenosugar biosynthesis. In the
<i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC 6803 <i>ars</i> operon, <i>arsS</i> is adjacent to the
<i>arsM</i> gene. The gene product, ArsS, contains a characteristic
CX<sub>3</sub>CX<sub>2</sub>C motif which is typical for the radical SAM superfamily. The
function of ArsM and ArsS was identified from a combination of <i>arsM</i> or
<i>arsS</i> disruption in <i>Synechocystis</i> sp. PCC
6803 and heterologous expression of <i>arsM</i> and <i>arsS</i> in <i>Escherichia
coli</i>. Both genes are necessary, indicating a multi-step pathway of
arsenosugar biosynthesis. In addition, we demonstrate that ArsS
orthologs from three other freshwater cyanobacteria and one
picocyanobacterium are involved in arsenosugar biosynthesis in those
microbes. This study represents the identification of the first two
steps in the pathway of arsenosugar biosynthesis. Our discovery expands
the catalytic repertoire of the diverse radical SAM enzyme superfamily
and provides a basis for studying the biogeochemistry of complex
organoarsenicals.

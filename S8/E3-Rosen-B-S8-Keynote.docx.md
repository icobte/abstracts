<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic is the most ubiquitous environmental toxin. Bacteria have
evolved the ability to use arsenic to gain a competitive advantage over
other bacteria at least twice. Microbes generate toxic methylarsenite
(MAs(III)) by methylation of arsenite (As(III)) or reduction of
methylarsenate (MAs(V)). MAs(III) is oxidized aerobically to MAs(V),
making methylation a detoxification process. MAs(V) is continually
re-reduced to MAs(III) by other community members, giving them a
competitive advantage over sensitive bacteria. Because generation of a
sustained pool of MAs(III) requires microbial communities, these complex
interactions are an emergent property. We show that reduction of MAs(V)
by <i>Burkholderia</i> sp. MR1 produces toxic MAs(III) that inhibits growth
of <i>Escherichia coli</i> in mixed culture. There are three microbial
mechanisms for resistance to MAs(III). ArsH detoxifies MAs(III) by
oxidation to nontoxic MAs(V). ArsI degrades MAs(III) by cleavage of the
C-As bond to form less toxic As(III). ArsP confers resistance by efflux
of MAs(III). Cells of <i>E. coli</i> expressing the MAs(III)-resistance gene
<i>arsI</i>, <i>arsH</i> or <i>arsP</i> grow in mixed culture with <i>Burkholderia</i> sp.
MR1 in the presence of MAs(V). Thus MAs(III) has antibiotic properties:
a toxic organic compound produced by one microbe to kill off
competitors. Our results demonstrate that life has adapted to use
environmental arsenic as a weapon in the continuing battle for
dominance. Supported by NIH grants GM55425 and ES023779 to BPR, and by

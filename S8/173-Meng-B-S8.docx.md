<p style="text-align:justify">Rice paddy soil, as a typical ephemeral wetland, is known to be a
significant environment for mercury (Hg) methylation. The methylation of
inorganic mercury (IHg) in rice paddy soil constitutes a key step in the
cycling of Hg in this special terrestrial ecosystem. An understanding of
the factors that control the methylmercury (MeHg) production is
necessary to underpin more reliable risk assessment and appropriate
strategies to remediate contaminated soil. In this study, we compared
the source and distribution of Hg species in different compartments of
the rice paddy during a complete rice growing season at two different
typical Hg-contaminated mining sites in Guizhou province, China: an
abandoned site and a current-day artisanal site. <i>In-situ</i> specific
methylation/demethylation rate constants in rice paddy soil were
qualified using stable Hg isotope addition technique, simultaneously.
The possible biogeochemical controls on MeHg production within the rice
paddy ecosystem were further discussed in current study. Results showed
that the dominant source of MeHg to paddy soil is in situ methylation of
IHg. MeHg levels in rice paddy soil were a function of both
methylation/demethylation processes and the net methylation potential in
the rice paddy soil reflected the measured MeHg. Sulfate stimulating the
activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria was a potentially important
metabolic pathway for Hg methylation in rice paddies. Bioavailable Hg
derived from new atmospheric deposition appears to be the primary factor
regulating net MeHg production in rice paddies. We propose that the
concentration of Hg in ambientÂ air is an indicator for the risk of MeHg
accumulation in paddy rice.

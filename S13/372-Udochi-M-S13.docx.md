<p style=text-align:justify>Increased remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil is becoming
attractive due to unprecedented degradation of soil systems. Therefore,
sustainable remedial approach and the study of contaminant geochemistry
are topical areas of intense research. In this study, clay minerals, a
constituent part of soil system has been evaluated as an underlying
influence to soil cleaning. Multi-metal spiked simulated soil (SS),
prepared according to standard guidelines, and varied for
montmorillonite clay (MC) and kaolinite clay (KC) which, are commonly
found in soils were utilized as a proxy to investigate the leaching
behaviour of contaminated soils (SA and SB) of natural origin for
cleaning protocols using different chelating agents (ethylene diamine
tetraacetic acid [EDTA], ethylene diamine disuccinic acid [EDDS],
acetylacetone [Hacac], and citric acid [CA]) on a dynamic system.
Geochemical characteristics and metal quantification were conducted on
the samples using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman and inductive
coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) respectively.
Results showed that similar leaching trend were observed for both the
simulated and natural soil systems regardless of the leaching treatment
applied. As expected, higher leaching regime was observed for the
simulated soil compared to the natural soils due to metal ageing.
Geochemical analysis revealed a stronger influence of montmorillonite
clay minerals on the sorption of targeted metals compared to the
kaolinite clay.

<p style=text-align:justify>A more advanced soil washing protocol specifically engineered for a
recalcitrant-clay soil system is essential to promote agricultural
production, enhance food security and scale down land tenure problems in
the 21<sup>st</sup> century.

<p style=text-align:justify>Excessive internal phosphate presented in sediments is the essential
problem causing eutrophication of lake for decades, as a consequence of
iron reduction under anaerobic conditions. Recent studies reported that
the rare-earth element lanthanum has a strong binding ability towards
phosphate ions, while the underlying mechanisms are still not fully
understood. Herein, this work systematically investigated the mechanisms
of phosphate removal using La(OH)<sub>3</sub> by employing extended X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS), attenuated total reflectance Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), density functional theory
(DFT) and chemical equilibrium modelling. The results showed that
surface complexation was the primary mechanism for phosphate removal and
in binary phosphate configurations, namely diprotonated bidentate
mononuclear (BM-H2) and bidentate binuclear (BB-H2), coexisting on
La(OH)<sub>3</sub> in acidic conditions. By increasing the pH to 7, BM-H1 and BB-H2
were the two major configurations governing phosphate adsorption on
La(OH)<sub>3</sub>, whereas BB-H1 was the dominant configuration of phosphate
adsorption at pH 9. With increasing phosphate loading, the phosphate
configuration of on La(OH)<sub>3</sub> transforms from binary BM-H1 and BB-H2 to
BB-H1. Amorphous Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> forms in the presence of Ca, leading to
enhanced phosphate removal at alkaline conditions. The contributions of
different mechanisms to the overall phosphate removal were successfully
simulated by a chemical equilibrium model that was consistent with the
spectroscopic results. Taking the great advantage of the strong
complexation ability of La with P, novel magnetically recoverable
magnetite/lanthanum hydroxide [M-La(OH)<sub>3</sub>] hybrids have been further
developed. Results show that M-La(OH)<sub>3</sub> exhibits a strong sorption
towards phosphate with sorption capacities of up to 52.7 mg-P/g at pH
7.0 in water, and also demonstrate that sediment suspensions mixed with
a M-La(OH)<sub>3</sub> content of 1-3% exhibit a capability of up to 1.2 mg-P/g for
sequestering external phosphate compared with that of 0.2 mg-P/g for
pristine sediment at pH 7.3. M-La(OH)<sub>3</sub>-mixed sediment suspensions appear
to effectively sequester phosphate over an environmentally relevant pH
range from 4 to 8.5. These findings shed light on understanding the
surface complexes of La with P at the molecular level, and guiding to
develop new technologies for phosphate sequestration and recovery from
lake.

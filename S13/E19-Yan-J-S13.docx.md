<p style=text-align:justify>The cobalt-containing cobamides such as vitamin B<sub>12</sub> are the most
complicated non-polymer biomolecules in nature that have essential
biochemical functions in all domains of life. In organohalide
respiration, a vital process for the global cycling of natural and
anthropogenic organohalogens, cobamides are the requisite prosthetic
groups for the carbon-halogen bond-cleaving reductive dehalogenases.
Organohalide-respiring bacteria such as <i>Sulfurospirrilium multivorans</i>
(<i>Smul</i>) and <i>Dehalococcoides</i> <i>mccartyi</i> (<i>Dhc</i>) are key players
involved in the complete detoxification of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and
trichloroethene (TCE) to environmentally benign ethene. While <i>Smul</i> is
able to synthesize an unusual Nor-type of cobamide to sustain
PCE-dechlorination activity, the genome sequence analysis demonstrated
that <i>Dhc</i> strains are corrinoid auxotrophs and lack the ability for <i>de
novo</i> biosynthesis of corrinoid, therefore, exogenous corrinoid (i.e.,
vitamin B<sub>12</sub>) must be available to enable and sustain <i>Dhc</i> reductive
dechlorination activity. We re-assembled the cobalt-transport and
corrinoid-metabolism pathways in sequenced <i>Dhc</i> genome and demonstrated
the strategies that <i>Dhc</i> strain employ to rescue their corrinoid
auxotrophy in pure cultures and defined co-cultures. Understanding the
bottlenecks limiting the activity of cobalt-dependent
organohalide-respiring bacteria will not only elucidate microbial
ecology in the subsurface environments, but also may lead to innovative
engineering approaches that enhance reductive dechlorination rates and
extents and enable more efficient bioremediation applications.

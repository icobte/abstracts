<p style=text-align:justify>Many arsenic-bearing freshwaters are facing with eutrophication and
consequent algae-induced anoxia/hypoxia events. However, biogeochemical
cycling of arsenic in those eutrophic waters and its impact on public
health are still poorly understood. Here laboratory simulation
experiments are performed to study the effect of algal blooms on the
biogeochemical cycling of arsenic in a sediment–water–air system.
We found that the anoxia induced by the
degradation of algal biomass promoted an acute arsenic (mostly As(III))
release within two days from sediment to both the water and atmosphere,
and the release effluxes were proportional to the algae dosage. The
reduction and methylation of arsenic were enhanced at the sediment–water
interface, owing to the significant increase in arsenate reductase genes
(<i>arr</i>A and <i>ars</i>C), and arsenite methyltransferase genes (<i>ars</i>M)
caused by the increased anoxia. The analysis of synchrotron-based X-ray
absorption spectroscopy indicated that the concomitantly released
natural organic matter (NOM) and sulfur (S) at the sediment–water
interface reduced the As(III) release to a certain extent in the later
reducing period of the incubation experiment, by forming As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> (43–51%) and As(III)-Fe-NOM
(28–35%). Our results highlight the needs for the <i>in-situ</i> assessment
of arsenic in eutrophic freshwaters with its risk to human and animal
health.

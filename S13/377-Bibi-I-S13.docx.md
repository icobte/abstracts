<p style=text-align:justify>Chromium(VI) is a contaminant of priority concern, which can be reduced
and immobilized by transformation of toxic Cr(VI) to non-toxic chromite
(Cr(III)) in water and soil environments. Siderite (FeCO<sub>3</sub>), an
Fe(II)-containing mineral which occurs in many anoxic soils, sediments
and groundwater systems, can be extremely redox reactive, thus making it
a potentially important phase governing the fate and transport of Cr(VI)
in many subsurface environments. Here we investigate the sorption and
reduction of Cr(VI) on siderite, as well as speciation of Cr(VI)-reacted
siderite as a function of varying pH (4–10) and initial Cr(VI)
concentrations (0.5–10 mM) under strictly O<sub>2</sub>-free experimental
conditions. The maximum Cr(VI) removal capacity by siderite was 81 mg
g<sup>-1</sup> at pH 5, which decreased at higher pH values. Notably, up to 97%
and 91% of total aqueous chromium, at all initial added aqueous Cr(VI)
concentrations (0.5–10 mM), was sorbed/reduced to Cr(III) at pH 4 and 5,
respectively, indicating a strong Cr(VI) reducing ability of siderite.
At pH 6–10, over 90% of aqueous chromium was detected as Cr(III) only at
initial Cr(VI) concentration ranging from 0.5–1.5 mM. Chromium K-edge
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy confirmed the
complete reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) after equilibration of siderite
with low and high initial Cr(VI) concentrations (2 and 10 mM,
respectively) at pH 5, 7 and 9. In addition, Fe K-edge XANES and
extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of solid-phase
samples showed that 74–78% and 78–89% of Fe remained as siderite,
respectively, after equilibration with Cr(VI) at pH 5, 7 and 9, whereas
only 24% remained for the low Cr(VI) treatment at pH 5. Overall, this
study suggests that under anoxic aqueous conditions, siderite can
immobilize and detoxify Cr(VI), with the extent of these coupled
sorption and redox reactions being controlled by initial Cr(VI)
concentrations and pH.

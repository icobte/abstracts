<p style=text-align:justify>Understanding transfer of trace elements (TE) implies to unravel their
transport mechanisms in both fresh and marine waters. Their transport is
commonly ensured though suspended colloidal phases of which particles
arebelow &lt; 1µm that play the role of carrier phases. Among
significant mineral carrier phases susceptible to be found in
hydrosystems, iron oxides and hydroxides are recognized to be play a
major role in the association with TE and thus may act as vectors for
their possible transfer.

<p style=text-align:justify>Thus, the understanding of the different processes that govern the
adsorption and desorption of trace elements with iron oxides and
hydroxides is of first importance for the TE distribution. However,
natural iron oxide and hydroxides display complex properties and
morphologies without any possibilities to control precisely them that
thus do not facilitate the interpretation in the mechanisms leading to
TE adsorption.

<p style=text-align:justify>For this purpose, we developed novel synthetic magnetite nanoparticles
(nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) as model carrier phases with a perfect control of their
properties for a better understanding of the adsorption mechanisms of
arsenic and copper elements. The synthetic magnetite materials obtained
through the co-precipitation of both Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup> /
Fe<sup>3+</sup> = 0.5) were characterized by a set of complementary techniques:
X-ray diffraction, transmission and scanning electron microscopy,
Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and BET adsorption
method. The resulting nFe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> display a wide specific surface area
(100 m<sup>2</sup> g<sup>-1</sup>) with particles reaching a size of about 10 nm,
enhancing the immobilization of TE from contaminated waters, as it could
be observed through adsorption isotherms obtained for various
experimental conditions that mimic the natural context.

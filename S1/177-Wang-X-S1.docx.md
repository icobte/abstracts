<p style=text-align:justify>Green rusts (GRs), an important intermediate phase during Fe<sup>2+</sup>
oxidation, are commonly associated with various metal cations during
their crystallization in soils and sediments, but the effects of metal
cations on the formation and transformation of GRs remain unclear. Here,
we explored the effects of Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Ni<sup>2+</sup> and Cu<sup>2+</sup> on the evolution
processes of hydrosulfate green rust (GR2) under various conditions and
the mechanism of cations accumulation. The rates of formation and
transformation of GR2 decrease in the order of Cu<sup>2+</sup> &gt; Ni<sup>2+</sup> &gt;
Mn<sup>2+</sup>, and increase with increasing metal cation concentration. When
GR2 forms completely, a portion of each cation enters the structure of
GR2 by replacing Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and their amount follows the order of Cu<sup>2+</sup>
&gt; Ni<sup>2+</sup> &gt; Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Under all conditions, the final products are a
mixture of lepidocrocite and goethite; a slow mineral Fe<sup>2+</sup> oxidation
rate and a strong surface Fe<sup>2+</sup> catalytic effects both facilitate the
formation of goethite, conversely, favorable to lepidocrocite formation.
Additionally, these three cations exhibits different speciation and
spatial distribution in lepidocrocite and goethite: Mn mainly exists as
Mn(III) and locates in the interior of the crystals; Ni(II) uniformly
distributes in the minerals; Cu(II) with minor Cu(I) accumulated at the
(sub)surface of the minerals; thus, the complexity of these cations
entering the structure of iron oxides decreases in the order of Cu<sup>2+</sup>
&gt; Ni<sup>2+</sup> &gt; Mn<sup>2+</sup>. These new insights into the interaction between
GR2 and trace metal cations improve our understanding of Fe
mineralogical properties and the environmental geochemical behaviors of
the associated cations in redox alternating soils and sediments.

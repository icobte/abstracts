<p style=text-align:justify>The classical electrical double layer (EDL) theory explains the
interaction between ions and charged soil colloidal particles, playing
an importance role in the bioavailability and toxicity of ions in soils,
which are of agricultural and environmental concerns. A new approach
based on extrapolating measurements of suspension Wien effect is
suggested to determine the adsorbed ions distribution in the different
compartments of the EDL. The new approach was applied to assess Zn<sup>2+</sup>
distribution in the EDL of Zn-saturated soil colloids. The results
showed that more than 84% of Zn<sup>2+</sup> was adsorbed via chemical
interactions and located in the inner Helmholtz plane layer. The
remaining Zn<sup>2+</sup> fraction was electrically adsorbed and distributed in
the outer Helmholtz plane layer (0.3% to 2.1%) and in the Gouy-Chapman
diffuse layer (7.4% to 15.0%). Independently, the results of linear
combination fitting (LCF) of extended X-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) spectra indicated that the contents of outer-sphere Zn in paddy
soil I and boggy soil were consistent with the proportions of Zn<sup>2+</sup>
electrostatically interacting with the soil colloids based on the
extrapolation of the suspension Wien effect method, while the contents
of outer-sphere Zn in paddy soil II, yellow cinnamon soil and yellow
brown soil was overestimated by the EXAFS method. The approach proposed
in this paper to assess specific and electrostatic adsorption deepens
our understanding of metal sorption processes in soils and reinforces
the adequacy of the Grahame-Stern-Gouy-Chapman EDL model to describe the
ion distribution in the solid-water interface.

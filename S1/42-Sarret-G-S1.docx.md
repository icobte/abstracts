<p style=text-align:justify>Titanium dioxide nanoparticles are one of the most commonly produced
nanomaterials worldwide. They are present in many consumer products,
such as personal care products and food products. After use, a large
proportion of TiO<sub>2</sub> ends up in agricultural soils, through the
application of sewage sludge. A prerequisite for risk assessment is to
be able to distinguish this released TiO<sub>2</sub> from the elevated TiO<sub>2</sub>
natural background, and therefore detect anthropogenic inputs.
Furthermore, the current models of nanomaterial fluxes in environmental
compartments have large uncertainties, therefore field monitoring is
needed to be able to quantify actual anthropogenic inputs.

<p style=text-align:justify>In this study, the potential of analytical techniques, namely micro and
nano X-ray fluorescence (XRF), bulk and micro X-ray absorption
spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) to distinguish natural versus anthropogenic particles
was investigated. Three matrices were compared: sewage sludge,
agricultural soil that had never received sewage sludge, and
sludge-amended soil. The size distribution of TiO<sub>2</sub> particles was
determined by image analysis of the Ti nanoXRF maps. This revealed that
the soil and sludge have a similar size distribution, with a range of
nano- and micro-scale particles. Bulk Ti K-edge XAS spectroscopy showed
that the two major Ti species were the TiO<sub>2</sub> polymorphs anatase and
rutile. In the sludge, there were roughly equal proportions of rutile
and anatase. This information is important because rutile and anatase
have different toxicities. It is difficult to know which polymorph is
used in which type of product, and what are the global proportions of
rutile and anatase released into the environment. Amorphous TiO<sub>2</sub> was
also detected as a minor species in the soil and in the sludge by µXAS.
The combination of µXRF and µXAS data showed that there was no
relationship between the size of the aggregates and Ti speciation.
Finally, the morphology of the crystals observed by electron microscopy
and the status of TiO<sub>2</sub> particles within the organo-mineral aggregates
revealed as relevant criteria to discriminate natural versus
anthropogenic TiO<sub>2</sub>. In the sludge, smooth particles typical of TiO<sub>2</sub>
pigments were evidenced, whereas the soil contained rough and irregular
TiO<sub>2</sub> particles. Moreover, TiO<sub>2</sub> particles in the sludge were present
as weakly evolved aggregates, dominated by organic matter, whereas in
the soil they were intimately associated with organo-mineral assemblages
forming the soil micro- and macroaggregates, the building blocks of
soils. The observed differences in particle morphology may attenuate
over time due to the weathering of TiO<sub>2</sub> minerals. Likewise, the
formation of soil aggregates is a dynamic and continuous process, so the
progressive incorporation of anthropogenic TiO<sub>2</sub> within these
organo-mineral assemblages is expected. It is likely that with time,
engineered TiO<sub>2</sub> become indistinguishable from the natural background
in soils.

<center style=text-align:justify>Chromium is a redox active transition metal with a wide range of
valences (-II to VI) that control the geochemistry and toxicity of the
element. Managing risk from Cr-contaminated land often depends on
reducing the toxic Cr(VI) to the insoluble Cr(III) for sequestration so
understanding the redox effect of sorption onto soil mineral components
is critical.

<center style=text-align:justify>We hypothesize that clay minerals may act as both sorbents and
reductants to Cr(VI) and promote its reduction to Cr(III) however, clay
minerals with sorbed Fe(II) may additionally co-precipitate a
Cr(III)-Fe(III)hydroxide and sequester Cr further. To test the
hypothesis, we conduct Cr(VI) isotherm and pH envelope sorption
experiments with clay minerals with or without sorbed Fe(II). On select
solids, we use Cr and Fe XANES and EXAFS to characterize oxidation
states and precipitation products. Our study combines bulk sorption
experiments with microscopy, and bulk and micro-focused x-ray absorption
spectroscopies to follow the transfer of electrons between Fe and Cr and
how redox properties of these soil materials affect Cr redox and its
toxicity in flooded soil.

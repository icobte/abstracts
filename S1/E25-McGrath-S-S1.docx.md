<p style=text-align:justify>In order to understand the movement and bioavailability of trace
elements in the critical zone, it is important to understand the
chemical forms of the elements present and their changes due to
environmental and biological changes in the different compartments. To
achieve these advances, it is often not possible to rely on a single
method. Putting together the results from a number of different methods
to assess speciation and likely mechanisms for movement in biotic and
abiotic parts of the system is often very fruitful. Finally, the
increased mechanistic level understanding gained allows insights and
interventions for managing environmental or biological activity to be
designed and tested, so that more beneficial and sustainable outcomes
are promoted.

<p style=text-align:justify>This presentation gives several case studies of how such investigations
can be fruitful with examples of environmental toxic or essential trace
elements. Use of complementary methods for assessment is highlighted.

<p style=text-align:justify>First is the use of LC-ICP-MS, synchrotron and NanoSIMS to follow the
important threat of mobilisation and transport of arsenic in paddy rice
systems. These identified 1) that arsenite species predominate under
flooded conditions, 2) this is very mobile in the soil-plant interface,
3) rice plants use the same effective system for the transport for the
beneficial element Si and for arsenite species, 4) inside the plant,
arsenite is transformed and some is transported to the grain that people
eat whereas Si is diverted mainly to the leaves and 5) although movement
of inorganic As is held up to some extent at the material/seed
interface, methylated organic As compounds are more effectively
transported to the white endosperm of rice which people most often
consume.

<p style=text-align:justify>Second is the transformation of nanoparticles (NP) in the soil-plants
system. Using a number of techniques, we can detect the transformation
of ZnO, a commonly used NP, in soils and it uptake and transport in
plants. From this, we know that ZnO-NPs are rapidly transformed and act
like more soluble Zn salts after additions to soil. This has
implications for the effective use of different forms of this essential
nutrient, and for toxic risk assessment of such NPs.

<p style=text-align:justify>Finally, Se deficiency is widespread and we have investigated the forms
of Se in soils and the uptake of this essential nutrients by plants.
This has revealed its speciation in soils, uptake and competition in
plant sulphur uptake mechanisms, its forms transported, the location of
Se in grain, and its likely bioavailability availability to human and
animal consumers.

<center style=text-align:justify>Microfluidic devices offer new opportunities for visualizing and
quantifying fluid migration, precipitate formation, and chemical
reactions in geologically-relevant pore systems. Our team seeks to
optimize microfluidic devices for compatibility with synchrotron X-ray
analytical methods, such as microXRF mapping and microXAFS speciation
determinations. Successful development of synchrotron-optimized
microfluidic cells requires careful selection of materials used for
device fabrication (in particular the window material). Numerous methods
are available for fabricating microfluidic devices, but two have gained
the most notoriety for studying biogeochemical processes transpiring on
a microscale: casting devices in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and etching
Si wafers using now-standard photolithography techniques.

<center style=text-align:justify>A pilot experiment was conducted using a natural pore network device
constructed by soft lithography using PDMS. The internal surface was
made hydrophilic to introduce silanol (Si-OH) functional groups and
destroy methyl groups (Si-CH<sub>3</sub>). The network was a simulated sandy loam
structure generated from a 3-D packing algorithm. This aggregated soil
structure has “grains” arranged to form \~1 mm-diameter aggregates. It
is well suited for addressing questions concerning impacts of physical
heterogeneity on reaction product formation and distribution.

<center style=text-align:justify>Our pilot experiment simulated the release of arsenite (AsO<sub>3</sub>) into
groundwater containing trace elements (Zn, Cu and Ni) and other
nutrients (SO<sub>4</sub>, Ca and K). We observed the occurrence of hydrous
As(III)/Zn/Cu precipitates (formed below the saturation index) in
micropore domains with apparent flow restriction. This result is
exciting because As(III) is difficult to remove from natural waters
without advanced oxidation processes (general approach is to convert
As(III) to As(V) and then remove it from solution). Further measurements
are required to establish if surfaces themselves provided nucleation
sites that induced As(III) precipitation below the saturation index. It
is reasonable that the saturation index might locally be exceeded by
accumulating Zn and/or Cu ions at surfaces. It is speculated these
micropore-localized precipitates are stable As(III) minerals, such as
reinerite Zn<sub>3</sub>(AsO3)<sub>2</sub> or trippkeite Cu(As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>). Future work will
include microbeam Zn K-edge and Cu K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy to
characterize these precipitates. Future experiments will introduce
microorganisms that respire on As and possibly alter the long-term
stability of the As(III) precipitates. Continued development of
synchrotron-optimized microfluidic cells will enable <i>in-situ</i>
characterization of pore-scale biogeochemistry.

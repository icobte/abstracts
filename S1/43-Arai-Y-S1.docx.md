<p style=text-align:justify>Long-term fertilizer and manure amendments have resulted in the
accumulation of P in surface soils in intensively managed agricultural
fields in the Midwestern U.S. Phosphorus losses from these agricultural
fields have been an environmental issue due to its negative impact on
aquatic ecosystems. Sediment loss in surface runoff has been frequently
discussed as a primary transport path of P, and many scientists
downplayed subsurface loss via tile drainage networks in the Midwestern
agricultural systems. Concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP) and
total P in dranage ditches can range from just detectable to many tenths
of a mg /L in tile lines. Furthermore, the contribution of colloidal and
particulate P can be as high as ~45% during high flow events. These
concentrations and loads of P are more than enough to lead to
eutrophication and algal production in downstream water bodies. As part
of the Hypoxia Action Plan, the Midwestern states in the U.S. have
recently developed a nutrient loss reduction strategy to reduce P losses
from both point and non-point sources. There has been a great interest
in understanding the mechanisms of subsurface P transport processes
through tile lines. It was hypothesized that the subsurface accumulation
of P in the intensively managed agricultural soils is contributing to
the P loss from tile lines. Mollisols enriched in organic C, clays and
metal oxides could effectively retain P but it is not clear how and how
much P has transported through subsoils because of the poorly drainage
characteristic. We explored the soil P speciation and physiochemical
properties of P colloids in tile waters using experimental geochemistry
is conjunction with zetasizer, dynamic light scattering, synchrotron
based X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and P
K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy. In this
presentation, the depth sequence distribution of P, its reactivity and
speciation and the colloidal Fe controlled subsurface P loss in the
intensively managed agricultural soils in the Midwestern U.S. will be
discussed.

<center  style=text-align:justify>Anions are known to form a range of complexes from outer-sphere to
inner-sphere complexes at mineral-water interfaces. Certain ions (e.g.
AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>, PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>) are known to form the strong inner-sphere
complexes while the other (e.g. Cl<sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) form weaker
outer-sphere complexes. Some (e.g. CrO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>) are shown to form both.
However, it is not well understood why different ions form different
types of complexes. Here I present a simplified approach to evaluating
the nature of anionic complexes at interfaces based on the solvation and
protonation states of ions. In addition, the relative abundances of
these complexes can change as a function of solution pH and the
anion-proton dissociation/association, and water state. The kinetics of
the formation of strongly and weakly bound complexes also vary
significantly between ions at particle interfaces, and the weak H-bonded
and hydrated complexes are expected to form more rapidly and are the
first step in the formation of subsequent, stronger, inner-sphere
complexes. The molecular structures and abundances of most common ions
found in aquatic systems, such as Si(OH)<sub>4</sub><sup>0</sup>, Cl<sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>,
CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and PO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup> at interfaces- even if they are weaker
outer-sphere complexes- could play an important role in dictating the
sorption and relative abundances of toxic metal anions at interfaces and
their complexes. A detailed discussion of the anion complexation at
mineral-water interfaces, applications of different spectroscopy
methods, and the predictable approaches to the molecular structures will
be discussed.

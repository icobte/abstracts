<p style=text-align:justify>Understanding processes involved phosphorus (P) cycling in the
soil-water continuum requires novel techniques that can that go beyond
operationally defined methods and can connect sources, chemical
reactivity, and pathways of transformation. Here we present a series of
recent research efforts aimed to address these questions using HPIC,
HPLC-MS, NMR, NanoSIMS, Bayesian modeling, and stable isotope methods in
an agriculture-runoff dominated catchment. Our data show dynamic
variability of P speciation, influenced primarily by runoff and tides,
with phytate being the dominant form of P. Distinct sets of isomers and
isotopically identical phosphate moieties in phytate prove IRMS as a
reliable tool to track the sources of phytate. Isotope composition of P
pools and fingerprinting element modeling allow tracking sources of P in
the downstream water. The abundance of bacteria capable of phytate
degradation and expression of phytate genes indicate that the presence
of phytate promotes the proliferation of phytate-degrading
microorganisms. Similarly, the nanoSIMS method of measuring in-situ
isotopes is being investigated. While a scrutiny is needed to connect
results from different techniques, new analytical methods have enabled
improved understanding of micro- to macro-level P process in soils and
waters.</p>

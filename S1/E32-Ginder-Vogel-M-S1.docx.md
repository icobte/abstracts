<p style=text-align:justify>Interaction with redox-active transition metal (hydr)oxides impacts that
fate of many common organic and/or inorganic contaminants. For example,
the mobility of arsenic and chromium is largely determined by its
oxidation state, with As(V) and Cr(III) being less mobile than As(III)
and Cr(VI). The transformation from one species to another often occurs
at the surface of Mn and/or Fe (hydr)oxide minerals surfaces. Similarly,
organic contaminants such as bisphenyl A (BPA) and endocrine disruptors
are readily degraded at the surface of Mn(IV) oxides. Understanding the
reactivity of transition metal oxides in field settings requires a
comprehensive understanding of mineral-surface geochemistry, aqueous
products, and the kinetics and mechanisms of contaminant transformation.
Here, we use the reduction of Cr(VI) by chemically reduced iron
(hydr)oxides, as well as the oxidation of suite of phenolic contaminants
and As(III) by Mn(III/IV) oxides to explore factors that may limit or
enhance the reactivity of these minerals in common environmental
settings.

<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic pollution has gradually become a global environmental
problem, especially in soil and aquatic environments. It is a
carcinogenic element that exists primarily as arsenate \[As(V)\] and
arsenite \[As(III)\] in the nature environment, with As(III) being more
toxic and mobile of the two species. In addition, ferrihydrite, which is
widely distributed in soils and aquatic environments, can catalyze the
oxidation of Mn(II) and accelerate the formation of high-valence Mn,
which can significantly influence the speciation, toxicity, and mobility
of As when these species co-exist. In this context, we herein explored
the mechanism of As(III) oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and
Mn(II) using a kinetic approach combined with multiple spectroscopic
techniques, including X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, in situ
horizontal attenuated total-reflectance Fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, and in situ quick scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy.
Our results indicate that efficient As(III) oxidation by dissolved O<sub>2</sub> occurs on the
surface of ferrihydrite in the presence of aqueous Mn(II). Compared with
As(III) oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and Mn oxides (<i>i.e.</i>,
Mn oxides/hydroxides), the degree of As(III) oxidation in the
ferrihydrite-Mn(II) system was significantly higher, and the majority of
generated As(V) was
adsorbed on the mineral (<i>i.e.</i>, ferrihydrite) surface. Furthermore,
As(III) oxidation was enhanced upon increasing both the molar ratio of
Mn(II)/As(III) and the solution pH. The greater As(III) oxidation by
O<sub>2</sub> in the ferrihydrite-Mn(II) system was mainly attributed to the
formation of a strong oxidant of the instantaneous intermediate Mn(III)
species via Mn(II)
oxidation under catalysis by the ferrihydrite surface. Moreover, As(III)
oxidation occurred mainly on the ferrihydrite surface and was
accompanied by the regeneration of Mn(II), thereby rendering it
recyclable. These results therefore provide new insights into the
mechanism of As(III) oxidation on the surfaces of Fe oxides (<i>i.e.</i>, Fe
oxides/hydroxides) in the presence of aqueous Mn(II) as well as the new
details regarding the electron transfer mechanisms between the
As(III)-Mn(II, III)-O<sub>2</sub> species at the ferrihydrite surface, and could
lead to novel approaches for As(III) contaminant remediation in the
environment.

<p style=text-align:justify>Heavy metals have drawn increasingly more
attention for its possible damage to human health and ecological
environment. In order to prove up the accumulation characteristics of
heavy metals in the agricultural lands
on the periphery of Ningbo city in eastern
Zhejiang Province and the potential ecological hazard risk, topsoil
samples in the survey region were systematically collected so as to
determine the content of heavy metal elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni,
Pb, Zn) and reference elements (Li, Eu, Sc, Sm). Through the analysis of
elemental correlation, appropriate standard factors were screened out,
and then, according to the standardized method, the environmental
geochemical baselines of the heavy metals As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and
Zn in the survey region were established, so the baselines were
obtained, respectively, 6.93, 0.23, 77.22, 49.14, 0.80, 30.24, 58.40 and
125.80 mgÂ·kg<sup>-1</sup>. Taking the environmental geochemical baselines as
standard factors, the enrichment factor method was used to identify the
geological background sources of heavy metals in the soils and the
superposition of man-made pollution. As a result, the risk evaluation
and space early warning research of potential ecological and
environmental hazards of heavy metals in the agricultural lands of the
survey region were carried out. The research results showed, heavy metal
enrichment in the topsoils of the survey region was mainly influenced by
the activities of industrial enterprises and the concentration center
was densely distributed in the surrounding areas of printing and dyeing
companies, which had the tendency of migration to the low-lying plains
along water networks; Cd and Hg had potentially high ecological risk in
the survey region; GIS system was used to achieve the spatial overlay of
the enrichment factors in each sampling points, potential ecological
hazard evaluation results as well as agricultural land use status map of
the survey region, which realized the discrimination of the
superposition of man-made heavy metal pollution and the space early
warning of potential ecological hazard risk from the perspective of
geographical space.

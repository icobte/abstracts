<p style=text-align:justify>Because of rapid industrialization and urbanization in China, large
quantities of heavy metals have been discharged into the environment and
caused serous soil pollution. Among the contaminants, cadmium (Cd) ranks
the first in soil samples (7%) exceeding the limit. The availability of
heavy metals, rather than the total concentration, posed environmental
and human risks. Thus, this provide a strategy to remediation of heavy
metals contaminated soils by immobilization, which transforms heavy
metals into less bioavailable. In-situ immobilization is an inexpensive
and effective solution for the remediation of extensively heavy metals
contaminated soils. The immobilized metals may be released under
different environmental stresses. However, most studies have focused on
the influence of amendments on heavy metals availability and uptake by
plants in a very short time. Therefore, it is essential to evaluation
the sustainability of amendments under field conditions. In weak acid
and Cd polluted soil (pH: 5.05, Cd: 0.56mg/kg), Jiangsu province, six
alkaline materials were chosen as amendments and added to the soil in
2005. Through 10 years of continuous observation, the effectiveness of
some materials was still considerable. The soil pH and CEC were
remarkably increased by amendments at 1% dose. In contrast, the acid
extractable Cd was significantly reduced. The Cd concentrations in
<i>Artemisia selengensis</i> were compared in first, fifth and tenth year
after amendment. The results showed that concentrations of Cd in <i>A.
selengensis</i> were decreased with the increase of amount of
amendments. The correlation analyses showed that
the Cd concentrations in <i>A. selengensis</i> were significant negative with
pH, CEC and bio-availability of Cd. It was noting that the Cd
concentrations in <i>A. selengensis</i> were lower than limition at 1%
addition (China Food Safety National Standard for Maximum Levels of
Contaminants in Foods, GB 2762-2017), even ten years after amendment.
Furthermore, no significant effects were found on biomass and the uptake
of plant nutrition elements (K, Na, P, Ca, Mg). The selected materials
combined with biochar were also used to remediate Cd polluted paddy
soils in south China, Hunan (pH: 6.50, Cd: 0.45mg/kg) and Anhui (pH:
5.78, Cd: 2.3mg/kg). The results showed that composite passivators
obviously reduced the bio-availability of Cd by increasing soil pH, CEC
and OM, thereby decreased the uptake of Cd by rice. The Cd concentration
in grains was reduced by more than 60% by the passivators and reached
the limition. To our knowledge, this study was the longest evaluation of
the effects of soil immobilization so far. The findings could be
effectively and economically used for in situ remediation of heavy
metals contaminated soils at a large scale.

<p style=text-align:justify>Among all potentially toxic elements, arsenic (As) is considered as one
of the most toxic for the plants and, due to its carcinogenic nature,
also for humans. This element can exist in the soil in different
oxidation states (-III, 0, III or V) and forms (inorganic or organic).
Prevailing in the environment and the most lethal are inorganic forms of
As (arsenate (As<sup>V</sup>) and arsenite (As<sup>III</sup>)). Arsenic as a non-essential
element damages the plants at various physiological and biochemical
levels. Probably the most dangerous aspect of its acting in the plant
body at the subcellular level is the production of the reactive oxygen
species (ROS) like superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen
peroxide. To protect themselves, the plants dispose of antioxidant
systems including antioxidant enzymes (peroxidases, superoxide
dismutase, catalase) or they accumulate a non-enzymatic protectant â€“
proline. These biochemical barriers are a part of the plant immune
system which includes also producing mechanical barriers. The main
objective of the present study was to elucidate the role of peroxidases
in the model plant tobacco (<i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i>) facing arsenate
(Na<sub>2</sub>HAsO<sub>4</sub><sup>.</sup>7H<sub>2</sub>O) toxicity in the controlled <i>in vitro</i>
conditions. The seeds were surface sterilised and sown on the modified
MS cultivation medium as a control treatment or As treatments (several
concentrations were tested). Peroxidases as multifunctional enzymes are
involved in a wide range of physiological processes. They are not only a
part of an antioxidant defence but are also important players in the
phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways allowing e. g. lignin to be
synthetized. For that, the roles of peroxidases (POX) in different plant
parts were assessed in the present study histochemically <i>in situ</i>, by
measuring the specific activities of POX and at the molecular level
using a real-time PCR. The work was supported by Slovak Research and
Development Agency APVV under the contract Nr. APVV-17-0164.

<p style=text-align:justify>Hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] is one of the most pervasive contaminants
at EPA Superfund Sites, with almost 2/3<sup>rds</sup> containing chromium.
However, Cr exhibits vastly different behaviors depending on its redox
state. Trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] is fairly nontoxic and insoluble,
while Cr(VI) is readily soluble and highly carcinogenic. Despite the
significance of Cr(VI) in the environment, there is currently an
uncomplete understanding of its behavior under certain environmental
conditions. To further investigate this sediment cores with highly
elevated concentrations of Cr(VI) were obtained from the E.C.
Electroplating Superfund Site, Garfield, NJ. Sediment samples were then
characterized using both aqueous and in-situ techniques. Cr stability
and sorption mechanisms were determined in a stirred-flow chamber
utilizing competing electrolyte solutions of various molarities. The
effluent was speciated for Cr(III), Cr(VI) and co-released metals via
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to quantify Cr
release levels over the course of the reaction. At several time points
the stirred-flow reaction was quenched, to conduct surface analysis on
the soil. Sorbed Cr was speciated using synchrotron-based X-ray
absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS). Identifying labile and
recalcitrant Cr in the soil matrix is crucial to understanding the
cycling of Cr in the subsurface. This knowledge is essential in
designing effective Cr treatment strategies, such as bioremediation or
pump and treat to minimize the long term risk of environmental
contamination.

<p style=text-align:justify>Following rapid industrialization and modernization in the past decades,
widespread heavy metal pollution in China becomes increasingly acute,
especially the multi-metal contaminated farmland soils around mining
areas. In this study, the low-cost zeolite-supported nanoscale
zero-valent iron (Z-NZVI) was synthesized from a simplified liquid-phase
reduction of iron(III) salts to in-situ simultaneously immobilize the
Cd, Pb, and As in the acid and alkaline soils. With a lot of cationic binding sites and
mesoporous structures, zeolite had been combined with NZVI to reduce
nanoparticle aggregation and improve remediation efficiency. pH of two
soils with 30 g kg<sup>-1</sup> Z-NZVI amendment significantly increased from 5.1
to 5.8 and 7.9 to 8.1, respectively, due to the oxidation of Fe<sup>0</sup> and
release of OH<sup>-</sup>. After 180 d of incubation, compared with control
groups, 30 g kg<sup>-1</sup> Z-NZVI significantly decreased the available
concentrations of Cd, Pb, and As in acid soil by 0.1, 258.4, and 2.1 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>, which were also significantly decreased in alkaline soil by 1.6,
65.1, and 6.9 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Z-NZVI immobilized DOC and mitigated its
decomposition to maintain the higher pH and lower EC in acid and
alkaline soils until the end of incubation, hence combining of the
advantages of pH-adjusting and adsorption. During the process of
incubation, the fractions of these pollutants became more stable. The
results of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy
supported that arsenic compound (e.g., AsO<sub>4</sub><sup>3-</sup>), Cd<sup>2+</sup>, and Pb<sup>2+</sup>
were immobilized by the surface FeO<sub>x</sub>Â·(OH)<sub>3-2x</sub> shell and Fe<sup>0</sup> of
Z-NZVI through co-precipitation, complexation and reduction. Overall,
Z-NZVI has great potential for treating farmland soil multi-contaminated
with heavy metals.

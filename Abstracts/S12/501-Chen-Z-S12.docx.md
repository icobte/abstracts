<p style=text-align:justify>Recently, greenhouse
cultivation production (GCP) has grown rapidly and counts a large
proportion of vegetable production in China. In this study, the
accumulation, health risk and threshold values of selected heavy metals
were evaluated systematically. A total of 299 paired soil and vegetable
samples were collected from three typical intensive GCP systems along the typical area of northwest of China. Mean concentrations of Cd,
Hg, As, Pb, Cr, Cu and Zn in greenhouse soils were 0.21, 7.12, 0.07,
12.60, 24.30, 74.75, 26.72 and 82.22 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Compared
to rootstalk and fruit vegetables, leafy vegetables had relatively high
concentrations and transfer factors of heavy metals. The accumulation of
heavy metals in soils was affected by soil pH and soil organic matter.
The calculated hazard quotients (HQ) of the heavy metals by vegetable
consumption decreased in the order of leafy &gt; rootstalk &gt; fruit
vegetables. The HI values were all below 1, which indicates that there
is a low risk of greenhouse vegetable consumption. Soil threshold values
(STVs) of heavy metals in GVP system were established according to the
health risk assessment. The relatively lower transfer factors of
rootstalk and fruit vegetables and higher STVs suggest that these types
of vegetables are more suitable for cultivation in greenhouse soils.
This study will provide an useful reference for controlling heavy metals
and developing sustainable GCP.

<p style=text-align:justify>Some recent studies have indicated that the capacity of biodegradable
aminopolycarboxylic chelators to reduce the labile fraction of Cd, Pb,
Zn and other toxic metals in contaminated soil is similar to that of the
conventional non-biodegradable chelator ethylenediamine tetraacetate
(EDTA), with less impact on soil properties. Biodegradable chelators
iminodisuccinic acid (IDS) and glutamate-N,N-diacetic acid (GLDA) appear
to possess the greatest remediation potential. However, up to now the
biodegradable chelators were tested in small laboratory scale and not in
realistic process conditions of chelator and process water treatment and
recycling. It is therefore the aim of our study to apply novel, patented
ReSoil technology (US 9108233B2, US 10124378B2, GB patent appl.
201720126) currently the single available chelator-based soil washing
technology which was developed into commercial scale. ReSoil uses
alkaline conditions (lime, waste polysaccharide material) to recycle
chelator in washing solution and acidic conditions (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) to
precipitate chelator from diluted soil-rinsing solutions. Very small
quantities of chelator, which remain in remediated soil are permanently
absorbed on zero-valent Fe (added into soil slurry) to curb any
potential emissions of toxic chelates. Acidic and calcareous soils
historically polluted with Pb (main contaminant), Zn and Cd were used to
represent two different soil types. Tests was performed in a pilot-scale
ReSoil remediation facility (soil batches 10-100 kg, solid: liquid ratio
1:1). Initial results indicate that GLDA removes toxic metals almost as
efficiently as EDTA: up to 60 and 70% of Pb was removed from calcareous
and acid soil, respectively. GLDA is soluble under wide pH range and was
not precipitated in acidic phase of ReSoil process. Close to complete
chelator removal is essential for close-loop reuse of process waters and
to prevent generation of waste-waters. Biodegradation of GLDA in process
solutions or spry drying are presumable solutions, but could prove
time-consuming and expensive. GLDA was also much more aggressive for
soil organic matter (SOM) compared to EDTA, causing extensive
depolymerisation and SOM lost. IDS exhibited less than 50% efficiency of
toxic metal removal compared to EDTA. IDS was, however, easily recycled
in ReSoil process. The process parameters (material balance, cost,
potential toxic emissions from remediated soil), soil remediation
efficiency (total toxic metal removal, metal bioavailability reduction,
uptake into buckwheat (<i>Fagopyrum esculentum</i>) as a test plant),
biological soil properties (dehydrogenase, urease and Î²-glucosidase
activity) and pedological soil properties (SOM, available P and K, pH,
KIK) of soils remediated using biodegradable GLDA and IDS and benchmark
EDTA chelator will be reported.

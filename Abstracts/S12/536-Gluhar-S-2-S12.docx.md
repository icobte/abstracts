<p style=text-align:justify>Soil washing with chelating agents was proposed for the removal of heavy
metals from contaminated soils decades ago. Recently introduced ReSoil
technology recycles EDTA and process waters in a closed-loop process
using inexpensive and waste materials. No waste water is generated from
the novel soil remediation process. Furthermore, extensive soil rinsing
combined with the amendment of zero-valent Fe into the soil slurry was
shown to facilitate permanent adsorption of the remaining small quantity
of EDTA chelates. As a result, emissions from remediated soil are curbed
and the soil does not contain available EDTA. Any harmful remediation
effects on soil properties are thus restricted to process conditions and
exposure to EDTA during the washing process and they later disappear.
Indeed, the novel remediation method preserves the soil as a plant
substrate for the production of safe vegetables and does not
significantly affect the soil microbial structure and abundance, soil
enzyme activity and C and N cycles. Nonetheless, the lay public and
decision makers prefer so-called »green« solutions and are often
suspicious of chemical interventions. Using natural, biological means to
fix man-inflicted environmental damage is indeed appealing but it is not
always feasible for solving difficult problems. It is therefore
essential for the adoption of novel soil washing technology to research
into wide aspects of the safety and suitability of the technology. For
example, the ability of soil to mitigate the unwanted effects of
pesticide usage is at the base of modern agricultural food production,
as one of the most vital soil ecosystem services. It also safeguards our
drinking groundwater. The aim of the study was therefore to investigate
the persistence of S-metalachlor, bentazon, isoproturon and mecaprop-P
in freshly EDTA-remediated Pb contaminated acidic and calcareous
farmland soil. These four herbicides were selected since they are the
major contaminants of groundwater and surface freshwater in Europe.
ReSoil technology removed 79 and 73% of Pb from acidic and calcareous
soil with 740 and 2179 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Pb, respectively. The dissipation
kinetics of four herbicides was investigated under field conditions in
beds with maize (<i>Zea mays</i>) and barley (<i>Hordeum vulgare</i>). The
biphasic First-Order Multi-Compartment (FOMC) model was used to fit
experimental data and calculate the herbicides’ half-life (DT50) in
soil. Remediation significantly (up to 64%) decreased initial
dehydrogenase activity assessed as a marker of soil microbial activity
and prolonged the DT50 of herbicides in acidic soils from 16%
(isoproturon) to 111% (S-metachlor). Remediation had a less significant
effect on herbicide dissipation in calcareous soils; i.e., mecoprop-P
DT50 increased by 3%, while isoproturon and S-metachlor DT50 decreased
by 29%. Overall, the dissipation from remediated soils was faster than
the average DT50 of tested herbicides published in the Pesticides
Properties DataBase. Results demonstrate that EDTA-based remediation of
the studied soils does not pose any threat of extended herbicide
persistence.

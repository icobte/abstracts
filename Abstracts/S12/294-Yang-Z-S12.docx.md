<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic is complexed with ferrihydrite in bidentate or monodentate
structures in adsorption processes, which can reduce the effectiveness
of As(V). Ferrihydrite is metastable and can transform into crystalline
minerals with time, and this process could reduce the specific surface
area, surface sites and change the adsorption properties (such as
capacity, affinity) of arsenic. Previous studies have focused on the
adsorption capacity of As(V) in ferrihydrite or crystalline iron
(hydr)oxides (goethite, hematite and magnetite, etc.), however, the
understanding of adsorption capacity of the different mass fractions and
crystallinity iron (hydr)oxides produced by the ferrihydrite during the
conversion process, the strong adsorption capacity of the crystalline
iron oxides for arsenic, and the long-term stability of the formed
iron-arsenic complexes is still lack. The objective of this study was to
investigate the effects of arsenic concentrations on the transformation
of ferrihydrite; the adsorption characteristics of different crystalline
iron oxides on arsenic during the aging of ferrihydrite; and the
stability of As(V)-Fe complexes at 75 Â°C. The time of adding arsenate
was determined according to the conversion process of ferrihydrite, and
the stability of As(V)-Fe complexes in different aging stages was
investigated by wet chemistry experiments and spectroscopic analysis.
Results as follows: (1) Arsenic reduced the transformation rate of ferrihydrite, and the
inhibition intensity increased with arsenic concentration. High
(Fe/As=1.875) and low (Fe/As=5.66) concentration of arsenate were added
at different ferrihydrite aging period. The content of soluble Fe<sup>3+</sup>
remained basically stability in the high arsenic system but increased
with culture time in low arsenic system, suggesting that the conversion
and dissolution rate of ferrihydrite were affected by the arsenic
concentration. (2) With ferrihydrite aging time, the release rate of
arsenic was decreased and the stability of iron-arsenic complexes was
increased, which affected by arsenic concentration. High-concentration
and low-concentration arsenate were added at 0 d, initial stage (1d and
4d), middle stage (10d) and later stage (30d) of ferrihydrite aging,
respectively. At 0 day of ferrihydrite aging, soluble As(V) contents
began to increase after 1 day and 4 days mixing with high and low
arsenate; at the initial stage, soluble As(V) contents of two treatment
both began to increase after 8 day mixing; at the middle and later
stages, soluble As(V) contents of two treatment both began to increase
after 30 day mixing. (3) In the process of iron (hydr)oxide adsorbed
arsenic, the stability of iron-arsenic complexes was affected by the
crystallinity and surface characteristics of ferrihydrite and the
competition between iron and arsenic for Fe<sub>3</sub> cluster sites. (4) XRD,
FTIR and XPS analysis showed that partial arsenic gradually transferred
from the surface of iron (hydr)oxide into lattice with the ferrihydrite
aging and the arsenic adsorption time. Moreover, although ferrihydrite
has a strong adsorption capacity for arsenic, the As(V)-Fe complexes is
unstable and easily affected by the transformation of ferrihydrite.

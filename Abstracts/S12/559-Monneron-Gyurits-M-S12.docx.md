<p style=text-align:justify>Today, human activities appear to be the main source of soil
contamination. Due to its industrial activities, human shapes the
environment and radically modifies the balance around the activity sites
in which he lives. The question of the management of these contaminated
sites appears essential in term of environmental point of view, and
especially for health reasons when people feed on contaminated gardens
near factories. The integrated, multi-analytical approach of this study
conducted in the former industrial city of Viviez (Aveyron, France) in
the framework of the European project Intereg SUDOE "Soil Take Care"
aims to first identify the speciation of interest contaminants (Zn, Pb,
Cd, and/ or As), define the environmental risk related to storage to
finally establish a link between the present of each bearing phases and
the associated health risk. For this purpose, 11 points of interest were
sampled in order to have data on both the gardens close to the
installations but also on other spots such as a hiking path. For this
purpose, physical-chemical analysis of all samples has been performed
(pH, conductivity, CEC, grain size, % of carbonates and organic matter).
The bearing phases has been highlighted by µXRD, SEM-EDS and by
XANES(SOLEIL synchrotron) experiments. The environmental risk has been
evidenced thank to the BCR extraction and the standardized EN-12457
leaching procedure. For the health risk assessment, two steps are
required. First, the bioaccessibility procedure UBM, based onto
operational chemical methodology mimicking soil ingestion and its stay
in the gastrointestinal tract of the human body, was realized then, some
scenario was chosen to assess the non-carcinogenic heath risk for
children and adults Hazard Quotient (HQ) for Zn, Cd, Pb, As and
carcinogenic risk for As. Whatever the type of samples studied, a
contamination in Pb, Zn and As is effective. The main contamination is
shown for gardens soils with values up to 1500 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, 4000 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>, 150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in Pb, Zn, As, respectively. The nature of bearing
phases is quite similar whatever the samples, and is constituted by
micro to nanoparticles of franklinite, and polymetallic-iron oxides, and
affined by coupling µXRF, SEM and XANES. The sequential BCR extractions
showed a common behavior between zinc and cadmium, with a high
proportion of easily mobilizable fraction (F1). For Pb, the reducible
and oxidizable fraction are predominantly representing approximately 30%
each. Arsenic is link to the residual fraction, indicating a long-term
stability in soils. These results correlate with the UBM
bioaccessibility results highlighting that zinc and cadmium reach about
60% of bioaccessibility. For Pb, the average is about 40%. XAS
experiment were also done onto each phase after extraction (i.e. onto
solid and also liquid extraction) and confirm the data allowing to
determine and quantify the specific dissolution phases. With the chosen
residential exposure scenario, the risk threshold (Hazard Quotient) is
very often exceeded in the case of children for lead and arsenic.
Regarding the hazard index (HI = ∑HQ), considering the bioaccessible,
all except one of the samples present a non-carcinogenic risk for
children. Carcinogenic risk for As have also been highlighted.

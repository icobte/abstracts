<p style=text-align:justify>Tl and As contamination in agricultural soils poses a significant threat
to human health due to the exchangeable fraction readily assimilated by
crops. In the present study, a batch experiment was set up with As and
Tl contaminated soil in combination with two amendments (Fe-Mn binary
oxides and Titanate nanomaterials), to evaluate the effects of the
treatment on the mobility and bioavailability of Tl and As. The results
of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) indicated that the
Fe-Mn binary oxides exhibited the highest stabilization level for the
exchangeable fraction of Tl and As (Tl=49.61% and As=53.01%). Fourier
transformed infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
spectra of Fe–Mn binary oxides suggested that it combined the oxidation
property of manganese dioxide and the high adsorption features to As(V)
of iron oxides, surface complexation, oxidation and precipitation were
the main mechanisms for the stabilization of Tl, as for As, the main
mechanisms were complexation and oxidation. After 7 days treatment of
TNMs, more than 90% of exchangeable Tl was stabilized at TNMs dose of 3%
(by dry weight), but it had no effect on As. Excellent Tl stabilization
mainly depended on complexation of –ONa functional groups in the
interlayers and Ti–OH on the surfaces of TNMs as well as ion exchange
with Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup>. This study provides alternative potential <i>in situ</i>
remediation strateies for both Tl and As stabilization in contaminated
soils.

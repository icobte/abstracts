<p style=text-align:justify>The high frequency of antibiotic resistance being an environmental
pollution is a global public health concern. Environmental selection of
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is considered to be due to antibiotic
residues or metal residues, both lavishly used in livestock. In this
study we targeted three poultry farms to compare the co-occurrence
patterns of antibiotics and metals residues in relation to ARGs. We
quantified 296 ARGs using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain
reaction (HT-qPCR) based ARG chip, with an abundance range of
6.67x10<sup>-7</sup> - 9.55x10<sup>-01</sup> copy of ARG per copy of 16S-rRNA gene. More
abundant ARGs belong to aminoglycosides, MLSB, tetracycline, fosfomycin
and sulfonamides. LC-MS/MS was used for quantification of 49 antibiotic
residues and ICPMS for heavy metals quantification. These resistance
genes likely colocalize in microbial genomes in the farms. Selection of
these resistance cluster is likely due to application of wide range of
chemicals in many forms to the poultry birds which confer resistance and
disseminate to the environment. A significant co-occurrence pattern was
explored using network analysis between provided heavy metals and ARGs.
Antibiotics and heavy metals used in feed supplements were high elevated
in manure that suggests the potential for coselection of resistance
traits. Mental test and Procrustes analysis showed significant
correlation between ARGs profile and bacterial community. In conclusion,
these results indicate the role of heavy metals in feed in co-selection
of ARGs and MGEs in poultry farm environment and suggest a risk for
environmental ARGs dissemination via horizontal gene transfer.

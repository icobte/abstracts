<p style=text-align:justify>Natural ferrihydrites (Fh) often contain impurities such as aluminum,
especially in acid mine drainage, and these impurities can potentially
impact the chemical reactivity of Fh with respect to metal (loid)
adsorption. In the present study, we have investigated the influence of
aluminum on the sorption properties of ferrihydrite with respect to
environmentally relevant aqueous arsenic species, arsenite and arsenate.
We have conducted sorption experiments by reacting aqueous As(III) and
As(V) with synthetic Al-free and Al-bearing ferrihydrite at pH 6.5. Our
results reveal that, when increasing the Al:Fe molar ratio in Fh, the
sorption density dramatically decreased for As(III), whereas it
increased for As(V). Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)
spectroscopy analysis at the As K-edge indicated that the AsIIIO3
pyramid binds to FeO6 octahedra on both Al-free Fh and Al-bearing Fh, by
forming bidentate mononuclear edge-sharing (2E) and bidentate binuclear
corner- sharing (2C) surface complexes characterized by As_Fe distances
of 2.9 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively. The decrease in As(III) sorption
density with increasing Al:Fe ratio in Fh could thus be explained by a
    low affinity of the As(OH)<sub>3</sub> molecule for Al surface sites compared to Fe
ones. In contrast, on the basis of available literature on As(V)
adsorption mechanisms, we suggest that, in addition to inner-sphere 2C
arsenate surface complexes, outer-sphere arsenate surface complexes
forming hydrogen bonds with both [AlـOH] and [FeـOH] surface sites could
explain the enhancement of As(V) sorption onto aluminous Fh relative to
Al-free Fh, as observed in the present study. The presence of aluminum
in Fh may thus enhance the mobility of arsenite with respect to arsenate
in Acid Mine Drainage impacted systems, while mixed Al:Fe systems could
present an alternative for arsenic removal from impacted waters,
provided that As(III) would be oxidized to As(V).

<p style=text-align:justify>Birnessites are a variety of hydrous-layered manganese oxides
(phyllomanganate) in natural environments and known as the scavenger of
heavy metal in nature. Birnessites possess an external and an interlayer
surface that are both available for ion adsorption. However, the level
of quantitative understanding of metal ion adsorption to birnessite as a
function of the environmental conditions is still much smaller than that
of metal ion binding to iron and aluminum (hydr)oxides. The main reason
for this is that for the latter (hydr)oxides the multi-site surface
complexation model including charge distribution (CD-MUSIC) developed by
Hiemstra et al. has been worked out in combination with a
Stern-Gouy-Chapman (SGC) model of an electrical double layer (EDL),
whereas for birnessites only rather simple and not very realistic
surface complexation models have been used. In addition, heavy metal
adsorption onto birnessite was found to depend on the birnessite
microstructure, including the absolute numbers of vacant sites, edge
sites and the amount of Mn(III) in the interlayer and in the layer for
birnessites with a different Mn average oxidation state (MnAOS).
However, some controversy exists on contribution of vacant and edge
sites to the total heavy metal adsorption. Therefore, using X-ray
diffraction with Rietveld refinement to obtain the reactive sites and
their densities, a CD-MUSIC model combined with a Stern-Gouy-Chapman
electrical double layer (EDL) model for the external surface and a
Donnan model for the interlayer surface is developed for birnessites
with different Mn average oxidation state (MnAOS). Proton affinity
constants and the charge distributions of Pb surface complexes were
calculated <i>a priory</i>. By fitting Pb adsorption data to the model the
obtained equilibrium constants (log<i>K</i><sub>Pb</sub>) of Pb complexes were
6.9-10.9 for the double-corner-sharing and double-edge-sharing Pb<sup>2+</sup>
complexes on the edge sites and 2.2-6.5 for the triple-corner-sharing
Pb<sup>2+</sup> complex on the vacancies. The larger log<i>K</i><sub>Pb</sub> value was
obtained for higher MnAOS. Speciation calculations showed that with
increasing MnAOS from 3.67 to 3.92 the interlayer surface contribution
to the total Pb<sup>2+</sup> adsorption increased from 43.2% to 48.6%, and the
vacancy contribution increased from 43.9% to 54.7%. The vacancy contribution from interlayer surface was
predominant. The present CD-MUSIC-EDL model contributes to understand
better the difference in metal adsorption mechanism between birnessite
and iron/aluminum (hydr)oxides and is very useful for improving the
accuracy of the risk assessment of heavy metal ion pollution in soils.

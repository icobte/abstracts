<p style=text-align:justify>Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) are increasing used in commercial
applications and may be released into the environment with anionic surfactants,
such as sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), in sewer discharge. Little
research has examined the transport, retention, and remobilization of MWCNTs in
the presence or absence of SDBS in porous media with controlled chemical
heterogeneity, and batch and column scale studies were therefore undertaken to
address this gap in knowledge. The adsorption isotherms of SDBS on quartz sand
(QS), goethite coated quartz sand (GQS), and MWCNTs were determined. Adsorption
of SDBS (MWCNTs >> GQS > QS) decreased zeta potentials for these materials,
and produced a charge reversal for goethite. Transport of MWCNTs (5 mg/L)
dramatically decreased with an increase in the fraction of GQS from 0 to 0.1 in
the absence of SDBS. Conversely, co-injection of SDBS (10 and 50 mg/L) and
MWCNTs radically increased the transport of MWCNTs when the GQS fraction was 0,
0.1, and 0.3, especially at a higher SDBS concentration, and altered the shape
of retention profile. Mathematical modeling revealed that competitive blocking
was not the dominant mechanism for the SDBS enhancement of MWCNT transport.
Rather, SDBS sorption increased MWCNT transport by increasing electrostatic
and/or steric interactions, or creating reversible interactions on rough
surfaces. Sequential injection of pulses of MWCNTs and SDBS in sand (0.1 GQS
fraction) indicated that SDBS could mobilize some of retained MWCNTs from the
top to deeper sand layers, but only a small amount of released MWCNTs were
recovered in the effluent. SDBS therefore had a much smaller influence on MWCNT
transport in sequential injection than in co-injection, presumably because of a
greater energy barrier to MWCNT release than retention. This research sheds
novel insight on the roles of competitive blocking, chemical heterogeneity and
nanoscale roughness, and injection sequence on MWCNT retention and release.

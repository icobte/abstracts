<p style=text-align:justify>The continuing loss of fertile arable land increases the importance of
cleaning contaminated soils. The remediation of polluted sites received
increasing attention over the last decades. Today, dig and dump
approaches cannot live up to the increasing need for sustainable
solutions; so different in- and ex-situ remediation technologies have
been intensively investigated, also in combination with complimentary
soil amendments. In this context, soil washing techniques comprise an
enormous potential for the efficient and sustainable remediation of
trace metal (TM) contaminated soils. In pot experiments and an outdoor
raised-bed setup, we investigate the effect of a new ex-situ washing
technique using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) which efficiently
extracts TMs (Zn, Cd, Pb) from a contaminated Cambisol located at a
former lead mining and smelting region in Austria. Our research goal is
the reduction of TM toxicity in these soils while restoring the losses
in soil functionality by the application of organic and inorganic
amendments.

<p style=text-align:justify>Our results show that compared to the untreated soil, the washing
procedure successfully reduced the total content of the main
contaminants Pb, Cd and Cd by 80 %, 40 % and 70 %, resulting in a
significantly lower concentration of Cd and Zn in the aerial tissue of
radish (<i>Raphanus sativus</i> L.) cultivated in these soils. The
significant increase in biomass production, observed in the EDTA-washed
treatments, could have been caused by reduced toxicity levels. The Pb
concentrations on the other hand, tended to increase in the plants after
the washing with EDTA. Despite extensive soil rinsing after the washing
procedure, these findings suggest the presence of mobile metal chelate
residuals. To counter this effect, the application of Fe<sup>0</sup> was
investigated for its ability to adsorb and immobilize EDTA, eventually
reducing Pb in vegetable plants to concentrations below food security
levels. Water extractable ETDA-TM complexes will be measured
spectrophotometrically after induced ferroin formation in the extract.

<p style=text-align:justify>In parallel, the application of organic amendments (vermicompost and
biochar) after the washing procedure is studied to analyze the potential
for the restoration of plant nutrient availability, water holding
capacity and the microbial community. The water retention curves of
different amendment mixtures and soil microbial phospholipid fatty acids
will be determined with respect to the efficiency of the treatments in
revitalizing the washed soils. These findings will be used to select
appropriate amendment treatments for the raised-bed experiment.

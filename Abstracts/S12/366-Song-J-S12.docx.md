<p style=text-align:justify>Soil physicochemical properties (e.g. soil organic matter, moisture, pH,
soil type, etc.) not only influence the toxicity of heavy metals, but
also contribute to differences in microbial community structure.
Therefore, it is important to evaluate the long-term and short-term
effects of heavy metals on microbial biomass and the microbial community
in soils of similar physicochemical properties. Our aims were to
simultaneously compare the effects of Cd, Cu, Zn and their combined
action on microbial biomass and bacterial community structure, both in a
long term Chinese field trials and short-term laboratory experiments on
the same soils. Our hypothesis was that there are comparable
relationships between the effects of heavy metals measured in the
environment and in the laboratory, so that laboratory results can be
used as valid predictors of the environmental effects of heavy metals in
soil. Despite the low Cd concentrations in the field soil (maximum metal
concentrations 300 Zn, 500 Cu, 1.5 mg Cd kg<sup>-1</sup> soil), Cd apparently
produced the most significant negative correlation with biomass C.
However, in the laboratory experiment (250, 400 and 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) there
were no decreases in biomass C or ATP, or changes in microbial community
structure at lower metal concentrations and only at the high Cd +Zn and
Cd + Zn + Cu concentrations. At the heavy metal concentrations applied
in the laboratory experiment, the effects of Cu on the microbial biomass
and bacterial community were greater than Cd and Zn. Although Cd had no
significant effect on the microbial biomass below 1.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, the
synergistic effect between Cd and Cu made a significant difference to
the bacterial community. There was also a competitive relationship
between Cd and Zn. Therefore, should heavy metal standards be applied in
the future based on their effects on soil microbes, these results
suggest that it is important that the combined toxicity of heavy metals
should be considered, rather than the activities of individual metals.
Based on this study, we also conclude that there is little or no
relationship between field and comparable laboratory experiments on the
effects of heavy metals on microbial processes. Also, determining the
effects of individual heavy metals on the microbial community under
field conditions is likely to give false conclusions when other metals
are also present.

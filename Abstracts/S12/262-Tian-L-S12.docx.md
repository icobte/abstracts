<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) is not an essential element for plant metabolism and may
pose threats to soil-dwelling organisms and human health. Human exposure
to low levels of Cd can result in kidney damage as well as lung, bone,
cardiovascular system, liver and reproductive system damage. The
Cd-contaminated soils have become more prevalent than before, largely
due to contamination from metallurgical factories, waste disposal,
heating processes and agricultural applications. Whereas,
phytoremediation has been proved to be a potential cost-effective
solution for the remediation of contaminated soils. According to
previous studies, willow has a high efficacy of accumulation of Cd in
hydroponics conditions and could represent a prospective tree for
remediating polluted soils. Evidence exists that Cd and certain nutrient
elements, such as Fe and Mg, could share similar mechanisms of plant
uptake and accumulation. Previous paper show that Mg and Fe deficiency
in mature plants of willow (<i>Salix Viminalis</i>), grown in hydroponic
solutions containing 5 μg ml<sup>-1</sup> of Cd, caused a significant increase in
Cd accumulation in roots, stems and leaves. Although Cd uptake was
mostly confined in roots, high Cd content in aerial plant parts
indicates that the analysed Salix viminalis genotype is suitable for
phytoextraction. Besides, many soil bacteria are tolerant to heavy
metals and play important roles in mobilization of heavy metals. Thus,
comparing with phytoremediation, plants and microbe is emerging as a
fast, more efficient and reliable approach for the estimation of the
bioaccessibility of heavy metals in soils. Here we report that the
benefits of combining siderophore-producing bacteria (SPB) with plants
for metal removal. Metal-resistant SPB play an important role in the
successful survival and growth of plants in contaminated soils by
alleviating the metal toxicity and supplying the plant with nutrients,
particularly iron. Furthermore, bacterial siderophores are able to bind
metals other than iron and thus enhance their bioavailability in the
rhizosphere of plants. finally, an increase in plant growth and metal
uptake will further enhance the effectiveness of phytoremediation
processes. Therefore, isolating corresponding bacteria is a of key
importance for making decisions concerning soil remediation. Currently,
there were some SPB were isolated by chrome azurol S (CAS) soild medium
from Cd-contaminated soils sampled from Huize County in China. The
maximium siderophore concentration of them is Y12-D-1 bacteria, reaching
up to 90.6 mM DFOB (equiv.). This corresponds to tens of micromoles to a
few millimoles per liter if a relative molecular mass of 1000 is assumed
for siderophores. Then the siderophore produced by Y12-D-1 will be used
in hydroponic experiment to examine the ability of it in improving Cd
bioavailability and enhancing willow growth.

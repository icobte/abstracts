<p style=text-align:justify>Lead (Pb) exposure is a significant global concern due to its negative
impact on neurological and cognitive development in children.
Particularly, in many historic mining sites, high levels of lead (Pb) in
the ingestible soil (&lt;250 µm) and inhalable dust (&lt;10 µm) have
prompted the investigation into techniques for <i>in-situ</i> Pb
immobilization using soil amendments. Although the efficacy of Pb
immobilization using phosphates has been demonstrated via the ingestion
pathway (e.g. by promoting the formation of insoluble Pb-phosphates in
the soil), its efficacy in reducing Pb exposure via the inhalation
pathway has received little attention. This is particularly relevant
because 90% of the inhaled dust may be swallowed within 24 h and reach
the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract where the Pb may be subjected to the
same conditions as ingested soil. This study compared Pb immobilisation
efficacies of phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) amendments via ingestion and
inhalation pathways using <i>in-vitro</i> and <i>in-vivo</i> assays in conjunction
with Pb speciation and dynamics via X-ray based spectroscopic
methodologies. Mining/smelting impacted soil from Broken Hill, Australia
was amended with Phosphoric Acid (PA), Hydroxyapatite, Mono-Ammonium
Phosphate (MAP), Triple Super Phosphate (TSP), bonemeal biochar and
Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> at a molar ratio of Pb:P/Fe=1:5. Pb <i>in-vitro</i>
bioaccessibility (IVBA) was conducted in the &lt;250 µm ingestible soil
particle fraction (ingestible fraction) using the solubility
bioaccessibility research consortium assay, and in the &lt;10 µm
inhalable soil particle fraction (dust fraction) using
inhalation-ingestion bioaccessibility assay and artificial lysosomal
fluid assay. <i>In-vivo</i> bioassays were conducted in the mouse model
[relative bioavailability (RBA) in the ingestible fraction and blood
and tissue bioavailability via instillation in the dust fraction over a
24 h exposure period]. Spectroscopic methodologies utilised included
assessment of Pb-phosphate formation by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
(XAS) in the pre and post-IVBA residuals, 2D mapping of Pb in the mice
lungs and GI tracts by X-ray Fluorescence Microscopy (XFM) and X-ray
Absorption Near Edge Spectroscopy (XANES) in the 24 h mice lungs.
Despite no <i>in-situ</i> Pb-phosphate formation was observed using XAS
analysis, a significant reduction (p&lt;0.05) in Pb IVBA was observed in
all P amended ingestible fraction [Treatment effect ratio (TER):
0.02-0.1] and in PA, MAP and TSP amended dust fraction (TER 0.6-0.8). A
21.1% reduction in Pb RBA and 56.4% reduction in blood Pb concentration
were observed via the ingestion and inhalation pathways respectively. 2D
images of lungs and GI tracts via XFM indicated that Pb started clearing
from the lungs within 4-8 h and reached the stomach, while XANES
assessment of Pb speciation indicated that anglesites and organic matter
bound Pb were the predominant residual species in the lungs 24 h post
instillation.

<p style=text-align:justify>The metal(loid)s content in the environment is one of the important
issues in the environmental management. The metal(loid)s may be present
in the both from naturals like natural components of the Earth's crust
and anthropogenic sources as human activity effects. Some metal(loid)s
are toxic and dangerous for the environment. Chelyabinsk was chosen for
researching as a typical industrial Russian city. Road dust and
household dust were collected to investigate the contamination of
metal(loid)s (Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn, As and Pb) in outdoor and indoor urban. A
total of 32 road dust and 17 household dust samples were collected in
the urban area during August 2017. The concentrations of metal(loid)s in
the dust samples were determined using Аnalyst 400 (Perkin-Elmer) atomic
absorption spectrometer with a flame atomization mode. The study shows
that Zn has the highest content in road dust whilst in household dust,
both As and Ni have the highest content. Cu, Pb, Zn and Cr contamination
were significantly elevated in the outdoor and indoor dust. Risk
assessment models described by United States Environmental Protection
Agency (USEPA) was applied. The study showed that both children and
adults having individual health quotient (HQ)&lt;1 for all metal(loid)s
are at negligible non-carcinogenic risk. The combined total exposure
hazard index (HI) value for children was 1.07. It is indicating that the
metal(loid)s detected would harm the children. The cancer risk for
adults from exposure to As and Cr was found to be the acceptable or
tolerable, their carcinogenic risk assessment (CRA) was in the range of
1E-6…1E-4. The cancer risk for children from exposure to As and Cr was
found to be harmful to human beings (CRA &gt; 1E-4).

<p style=text-align:justify>Heavy metals are one of the major pollution in the ecological
environment，the contents of heavy metals in seawater and sediments can
adversely affect the marine ecosystem. Contents of heavy metals (Cu, Zn,
Pb, Cd, Cr, Hg, As) from 35 seawater and 12 sediments samples in
Huanghua, Hebei province, in Oct. 2018. Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd and Cr were
measured by ICP-MS and Hg, As were measured by AFS. The pollution and
potential ecological risk of heavy metals in seawater and surface
sediments have been assessed by comprehensive pollution index method and
Hakanson potential ecological risk index respectively. Results showed
that the concentrations of listed heavy metals in seawater ranged from
0.697 to 6.119 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 8.357 to 49.310 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.240 to 4.459
μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.013 to 0.967 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.0527 to 1.270 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.022 to
0.063 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.406 to 2.469 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and the average
contents were 2.715 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 31.476 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 1.178 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.077
μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.380 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.036 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.794μg·L<sup>-1</sup> , which were not
exceed the second standard of seawater quality of China (GB3097-1997)
and their comprehensive pollution index was less than 1 suggesting that
the seawater in the area was not polluted. Meanwhile the contents of
listed heavy metals ranged from 12.747 to 36.322 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 22.420 to
50.308 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 8.813 to 16.039 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 0.0395 to 0.148 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>,
12.327 to 36.046 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 0.006 to 0.043 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 1.990 to 15.425
mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> average contents of heavy metals in sediments were 22.647
mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 34.552 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 12.374 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 0.086 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 19.100
mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 0.023 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, 7.818 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> , which were not exceed the
first standard of sediment quality of China (GB18668-2002). And their
comprehensive pollution index was less than 5, the surface sediments
were not polluted. Furthermore, the results showed that the potential
ecological risk of heavy metals in the surface sediments were slight
pollution level, and the potential risk index of heavy metals were Cd
&gt; Hg &gt; As &gt; Cu &gt; Pb &gt; Cr &gt; Zn.

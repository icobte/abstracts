<p style=text-align:justify>Leaching tests for evaluation of materials for co-disposal, landfilling
or use as remediation material is often performed using HCl. But when
evaluating a material for acidic sulfide mine waste remediation leaching
with HCl is not ideal since the typical ARD often contains high
concentrations of sulfate and ferrous iron that have an impact on the
mobility of trace elements. Green liquor dregs (GLD) is an alkaline
by-product from the paper and pulp industry with a pH between 10 and 14.
It mainly consists of non-process elements from the wood pulping,
organic material and spent cooking chemicals as well as calcite. Samples
were collected from two different mills in the southern part of Sweden
(Aspa and Frövi). Frövi adds lime mud (mainly calcite) during the final
dewatering of GLD while Aspa does not. Each GLD was leached with three
acidic solutions: HCl, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>+Fe<sup>2+</sup> (final Fe<sup>2+</sup>
concentration 100 mg/L). 11 subsamples of each GLD was added different
amounts of leaching solution (including an untreated subsample).
Leaching of calcium and lead is strongly affected by the composition of
the leaching solution due to the formation of sulfate mineral
precipitates. HCl leaches much higher concentrations than H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> and
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>+Fe<sup>2+</sup>. For calcium leaching with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> regardless of
addition of Fe results in calcium reaching a constant concentration of
437 mg/L for Aspa and 432 mg/L for Frövi at or above pH 8. For lead,
when lime mud is present, leaching with H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>+Fe<sup>2+</sup> yields lower
leached concentrations than when only using H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. This effect can
also be seen for chromium but the HCl leached amount is not as much
higher as for calcium and lead. For chromium it can also be seen that
from approximately pH 7.75 the leached concentrations from the H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
leached samples decrease linearly to about pH 6.75 where the leached
concentrations are at their lowest (the effect is clearer when lime mud
is present). This suggest that there is a presence of negatively charged
chromium as Cr(VI) and its subsequent reduction to Cr(III). In the
presence of lime mud uranium and cadmium leached less when leached with
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> compared to when leached with HCl (5-10% for cadmium, 4-14%
for uranium). Addition of Fe gives slightly lower concentrations for
uranium and slightly higher concentrations for cadmium. However, these
effects are not seen as clearly for uranium when lime mud is not present
in the samples and not at all for cadmium. This is attributed to the
speciation of uranium ($\mathrm{\text{UO}}_{\mathrm{2}}^{\mathrm{2 +}}$)
forming negative complexes when carbonate and/or sulfate are present.
For zinc and cobalt no significant difference was noted for different
leaching solutions. pH is lowered by the addition of ferrous iron with
around 0.55 to 0.14 pH units. Elements most susceptible to the presence
of sulfate, carbonate and ferrous iron are lead and chromium whereas
zinc and cobalt are not affected. In conclusion when evaluating an
alkaline material through acid leaching for use in reclamation of acidic
mine waste it is important to use a leaching solution similar to the ARD
and not only HCl in order to not overestimate the leached concentrations
of trace elements.

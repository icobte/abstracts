<p style=text-align:justify>Most antibiotics (ABs) are variable charge ligands, which possess metal
complexing functional groups. They consequently bind to soil in various
modes, e.g. pH-dependent complexation, ion exchange, hydrophobic
interactions. This variability and the complexity of the soil make the
prediction of AB sorption on soils a challenging task.

<p style=text-align:justify>Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a sulfonamide-class antibiotics. Its binding
modes on a silty-loam soil were studied by combining batch and column
experiments at varying organic matter (manure, percentage scale)
amendment levels and at varying metal (Cu(II) and Zn(II))
contaminations. The site density of both soil and manure was equated to
their proton sorption capacity between pH 4 to 10. That of manure (1.2
mmol/g) is 12 times higher than that of the 2% OM containing soil (0.1
mmol/g). In batch experiments the concentration of sorbed SMX ( 0.003 ≤
[SMXads] ≤ 1 µmol/g) increased with the site density equally in both
soil and manure, and also equally in manure-amended soil. This shows
that both substrates have a similar substrate-SMX sorption strength.
These results combined to results performed on pure humic acids (site
density of 2.4 mmol/g) indicate that OM is the soil phase of dominant
reactivity toward SMX.

<p style=text-align:justify>The sorption of SMX increased in copper- and zinc-contaminated soils.
Quantitative speciation analysis of the SMX-soil-metal-pH system
involving variable pH sorption experiments and a minimum number of
adjustable constants were performed. Metals form strong binding sites on
the soil surface; SMX binds preferably as a ternary SMX-metal-soil
complex. Overall, in batch experiments the effects of metals and OM
additions on SMX sorption are quantitatively predictable.

<p style=text-align:justify>In contrary the SMX reactive transport experiments in columns do not
agree with this ‘predictivity scenario’. On the reference soil in the
columns the amount of sorbed SMX slightly decreases compared to the
predictions from batches. That expected result likely relates to a more
difficult access of SMX to the sites in the aggregated soil. But
unexpectedly, in the soil amended with manure the amount of sorbed SMX
did not increase but decrease. Moreover, still contrary to batches, the
contamination of the soil with metals does not increase the amount of
sorbed SMX. These observations relate probably to a concentration effect
of organic matter. In the column the OM from manure may completely
imprison metals and close access to micropores thus decreasing
dramatically the sites accessible to SMX sorption. Such effects appear
plausible when considering the ductility of organic matter as
highlighted from molecular dynamics calculations. The combination of
batch and column experiments appears to be a valuable frame for
determining the predominant sorption modes of organic ligands on complex
soil substrates.

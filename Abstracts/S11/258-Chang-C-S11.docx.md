<p style=text-align:justify>Enshi, located in Middle China, is a typical
seleniferous area of the world. Rice is the most
important Selenium(Se) exposure source to local residents in Enshi,
however, the translocation of Se in the soil-rice system remains poorly
understood. The present study assessed the major Se fractions in Se-rich
soils and which soil Se fractions are bioavailable for rice plants grown
in Enshi. Rice plants and corresponding rhizosphere soils were collected
throughout Enshi. Different soil Se fractions were extracted using
sequential chemical extraction method. Soil organic matter (SOM) and
soil pH were measured to understand their influences on Se
transformation in soils. The concentration and bioaccumulation factors
were investigated to understand the translocation of Se from soil to
rice. The results showed that soil Se fractions are largely controlled
by soil organic matter (SOM) contents. Decomposition of organic matter
results in low SOM levels, which promote the transformation of
organic-bound Se to water-soluble Se and ligand-exchangeable Se.
Water-soluble, ligand-exchangeable and organic-bound Se fractions are
the major sources of Se in rice tissues in Enshi. The structural
equation modeling(SEM) applied in this study also support our
conclusions well. This study will provide insights on biogeochemistry of
Se in seleniferous area.

<p style=text-align:justify>Zinc (Zn) is a trace element (TE) that occurs naturally in soils,
however spreading Zn-rich organic waste (OW) on farmlands may lead to
hazardous Zn levels. Common problems are related to phytotoxicity,
introduction into the food chain and groundwater contamination.
Assessing the associations between OW-borne Zn and the soil matrix is
paramount to predict its short- and long-term behavior in the
environment. This is usually pursued by using either single/sequential
extractions (SSE) or spectroscopic methods such as XAS. Nevertheless,
SSE reflects element extractability rather than the nature of its
interactions with bearing phases, while XAS requires synchrotron
radiation sources that are not available in certain regions of the
world. We applied a third approach in this study – namely soil density
fractionation – to isolate and characterize the constituents of the soil
matrix (i.e. potential Zn bearing phases) and thereafter identify their
associations with natural and OW-borne Zn. The target density fractions
were the following: &lt;1.9 g cm<sup>-3</sup>, 1.9–2.25 g cm<sup>-3</sup>, 2.25–2.5 g
cm<sup>-3</sup>, 2.5–2.7 g cm<sup>-3</sup>, &gt;2.7 g cm<sup>-3</sup>, plus an extractable
fraction. The soil analyzed was a clayey Hapludox soil that received
controlled pig slurry applications over 11 years, causing a 2-fold
increase in Zn concentration within the surface layer: from 105.8 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup> of Zn (control soil) to 206.6 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of Zn (amended soil).
Among the six selected density fractions, two of them were the most
contrasting and representative. (I) The light fraction (&lt;1.9 g
cm<sup>-3</sup>) contained high OM concentration but accounted for only \~5% of
the bulk soil mass. (II) The mineral-rich fraction (2.5–2.7 g cm<sup>-3</sup>)
contained mainly quartz, kaolinite, vermiculite, a small amount of
hematite and accounted for \~80% of the soil mass. In the control soil
(no pig slurry application), 79.7% of the Zn was found in the
mineral-rich 2.5–2.7 g cm<sup>-3</sup> fraction. In the soil amended with pig
slurry, the proportion of Zn found in the 2.5–2.7 g cm<sup>-3</sup> fraction
decreased to 57.3%, as Zn was also found in the OMrich &lt;1.9 g cm<sup>-3</sup>
fraction (13.2%) and in the extractable fraction (16.6%). Other
fractions were less representative in both soils (control and amended).
The extractable, &lt;1.9 g cm<sup>-3</sup> and 2.5– 2.7 g cm<sup>-3</sup> fractions
accounted for roughly <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> each of the OW-borne Zn fate in the
amended soil. Finally, these results were compared with data we
previously reported for the same field experiment using well-stablished
SSE and XAS techniques. Density fractionation not only agreed but also
complemented the understanding of previous observations. This work
demonstrates that density fractionation may be used as either main or
complementary approach for assessing the biogeochemistry of TE such as
Zn in the context of OW recycling in agricultural soils.

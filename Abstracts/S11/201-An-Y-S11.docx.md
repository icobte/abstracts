<p style=text-align:justify>Roxarsone (ROX) and <i>p</i>-arsanilic acid (ASA) are widely used as feed
additives to increase the weight of animals and are excreted in animal
wastes, and the use of these animal wastes as organic fertilizers in
agriculture soils will cause the pollution of arsenic in the soils. The
biotransformation of roxarsone and p-arsanilic acid in agriculture soils
determine their ecological risks. This study was conducted to determine
ROX, ASA and their metabolites (arsenate (As(V)), arenite (As(III)),
monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA)) in soils by
HPLC-ICP-MS/MS. Arsenic species were well separated by malonic acid
within a short retention time of 9.2 min. The detection limits obtained
by ICP-MS using helium collision mode and ICP-MS/MS using oxygen
reaction mode were comparable. ICP-MS/MS provided a low detection limit
for As(V), DMA, MMA, ASA and ROX (0.85 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, 1.59 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.93 μg
L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.94 μg L<sup>-1</sup>, 1.03 μg L<sup>-1</sup> and 1.15 μg L<sup>-1</sup>) and excellent
recoveries (93.8-105.8%). The extraction of arsenic from soils by
phosphate was assisted by microwave, which provided a good extraction
efficiencies for As(V), DMA, MMA, ASA and ROX (41.7%, 103.9%, 89.9%,
120.4%, 70.7%, and 84.9%). This study provided a robust and convenient
analytical method for the investigation of ROX, ASA and their
metabolites in soils.

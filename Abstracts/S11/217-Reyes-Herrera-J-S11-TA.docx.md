<p style=text-align:justify>Nanoparticles (NPs) are present in a broad range of products and
industrial processes. However, their intrinsic novel properties
represent also a challenge on understanding their fate and behaviour in
the environment. This is the case of titanium dioxide nanoparticles
(TiO<sub>2</sub>NPs), since they are increasingly used in many commercial
products (e.g. sunscreens, cosmetics, paints and plastics). 50,400 tons
of TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs were globally produced in 2010, making these NPs some of
the most produced in the world. Thus, it is important to determine their
potential harmful effects they may have on ecosystems and health once
released into the environment. Previous studies have shown that
TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs induce genotoxicity in cells, mainly through the generation
of oxidative stress. In addition, the National Institute of Occupational
Safety and Health (NIOSH) concluded that TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs are potentially
carcinogenic (respiratory exposure). An important environmental concern
is their release into wastewaters, ending up in the sludge produced in
wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). With the increasing use of WWTPs
sludge as amendment in agricultural soils, a depth characterization of
TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs in sludge samples is necessary for assessing potential
environmental risks. This work aims to the physical and chemical
characterization of TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs present in the sludge of WWTPs.

<p style=text-align:justify>The sludge samples were collected from WWTPs in the State of Chihuahua,
Mexico. This state is territorially located in semi-desert zone, a
climatic condition that causes the habit of the population to use
sunscreen or moisturizers daily (often containing TiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs). The
samples were analysed by synchrotron and laboratory X-ray based
techniques, X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), X-ray Absorption Near-Edge
Spectroscopy (XANES) and X-ray Diffraction (XRD), using different probe
sizes, i.e. bulk, micro and nano. Clear evidence of nanoparticulate Ti
material was found in the sludge, along with other Cu and Zn particles
with size distributions in the range of 100 nm, 200 nm and 300 nm.
XANES spectra from large particles (&gt;3 μm) corresponds to amorphous
TiO<sub>2</sub> whereas smaller particles shown rutile phase and, the most
copious, anatase. XRD signal from these organized phases were detected
by bulk XRD, and from small particles with micro-XRD (&lt;1 μm).)

<p style=text-align:justify>By combining several X-ray based techniques, the Ti concentration and
its speciation in function of the particle size has been obtained.
Sub-micron and nano particles with high ordinate phases were found in
the sludge, which could correspond to engineered nanomaterials.

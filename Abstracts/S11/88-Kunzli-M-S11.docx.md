<p style=text-align:justify>Agronomic biofortification of wheat is a strategy to alleviate zinc (Zn)
deficiency in human nutrition. The application of green manure (GM) to
soils with low Zn availability can increase the transfer of Zn from soil
to wheat, however, this practice can also influence the plant
availability of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd). We tested the effect of GM
addition on the transfer of Zn and Cd from soil to wheat (<i>Triticum
aestivum</i> L.).

<p style=text-align:justify>To obtain GM, sunflower (<i>Helianthus annus</i> L.) was grown and labeled
with <sup>67</sup>Zn and <sup>111</sup>Cd in hydroponics. In a pot trial, different
quantities of milled sunflower were amended as GM to a soil that either
was fertilized with ZnSO<sub>4</sub> (high Zn availability) or not fertilized
(low Zn availability). The soil solution was frequently analyzed during
wheat growth and the wheat was harvested at flowering and full maturity.
Isotope ratios (<sup>67/66</sup>Zn and <sup>111/110</sup>Cd) of purified soil solution and
wheat samples were analyzed with Q-ICP-MS.

<p style=text-align:justify>The addition of GM to soil increased wheat root and shoot biomass as
well as pH and total nitrogen (TN) in the soil solution. Furthermore, GM
increased N concentrations in the wheat shoots and initially also
dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil solution.

<p style=text-align:justify>The average Zn concentration in wheat grains were higher in soils with
high than with low Zn availability (high Zn: 101 ± 1.9 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, low Zn
28 ± 0.9 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). However, the reverse pattern was found for Cd (high
Zn: 0.15 ± 0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, low Zn: 0.437 ± 0.01 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). No
significant effect of GM addition on shoot and grain Zn and Cd
concentration was observed due to increased biomass (dilution effect).
However, the transfer of Zn and Cd into wheat shoots strongly increased
with the application of GM to soils with low Zn availability (Zn: from
67 to 121 µg, Cd: from 1.51 to 2.74 µg). In these soils, isotope mass
balances revealed that the increased transfer was mainly caused by an
indirect effect through solubilization of these metals from the bulk
soil (Zn: + 39 µg, Cd: + 1.07 µg), but also directly through the
addition of the metals with GM (Zn: + 16 µg, Cd: + 0.16 µg). Our data
suggest that the increased soil-plant transfer of Zn and Cd was mainly
caused by the decomposition of GM that (i) released organic compounds
which solubilized Zn and Cd from the bulk soil, (ii) improved N supply
in the initial phase of wheat growth, which led to a better soil
exploitation and enhanced root exudates.

<p style=text-align:justify>This study showed that GM amendments to soils can increase the
soil-wheat transfer of Zn but also the transfer of Cd. A combination of
agronomic biofortification measures, such as GM addition and mineral Zn
fertilization could contribute to a healthier balance of Zn and Cd in
wheat grains.

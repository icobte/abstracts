<p style=text-align:justify>Agriculture, and particularly animal husbandry, is one of the major
waste producing activities on the planet. In response to continuously
growing demand for animal protein, livestock production generates
increasing amounts of manure. In 2017, 1 billion pigs were produced in
the World, with approximately half of it in China. Livestock manure
treatment and disposal have become a major issue of the present-day
agriculture. Spreading this organic-rich amendment on the soil helps
improving soil physico-chemical properties and fertility at the same
time that allows the manure recycling. Yet, pig and dairy manures are
also rich in Cu and Zn. These potentially toxic trace metals are added
to the animal feed, but not digested by the animals. Thus, intensive use
of pig and dairy manures as amendment has for a consequence massif
inputs of Cu and Zn in agricultural soils.

<p style=text-align:justify>In order to anticipate and prevent degradation of agricultural soils
amended with livestock manure, it is crucial to understand the sources
and the long-term behavior of these exogenous metals. Published works on
manure-borne Cu and Zn in soils described rather low plant uptake,
contamination of water resources and accumulation within the soil. A few
studies, focused on the speciation, showed that Cu and Zn are present as
Cu<sub>2</sub>S and ZnS in the pig manure. However, no ZnS was detected in soils
amended with pig slurry, instead, Zn was found to be adsorbed on clay
minerals and iron ox-hydroxides. In addition, none of these studies was
able to differentiate between natural and exogenous trace elements.

<p style=text-align:justify>We have investigated manure-amended soils and the corresponding pig and
dairy manures applied over several years in three experimental sites
located in Brazil. We have analyzed Cu and Zn concentrations and
isotopic compositions aiming at evaluating the potential of stable Cu
and Zn isotopes as tracers of exogenous metal transformation and
redistribution in soils. We observed that livestock manure amendments
have rather homogeneous Zn isotopic compositions but show differences in
Cu isotopic compositions, depending on the type of waste (pig slurry or
dairy manure). Furthermore, Cu and Zn isotopic compositions of the soils
that have received large amounts of manure amendments are (i) different
from those of the control soil and (ii) intermediate between the
isotopic compositions of the control soil and the manure applied. Thus,
although the original isotopic signature of a given manure is most
likely modified after spreading on the soil, the input of manure-borne
Cu and Zn can be detected in soils, particularly in the case of massive
treatments. These preliminary results show that stable Cu and Zn
isotopes represent a promising tool for studying the behavior of
exogenous trace elements from organic-rich amendments. Further
application of this approach opens new perspectives, particularly for
investigating target mineral phases and long-term behavior of these
metal in soils, as well as for tracing the source of contamination in
areas without monitoring history.

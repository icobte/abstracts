<p style=text-align:justify>Iron is one of the most frequently utilized transition metal in the
biosphere and plays a crucial role in the biogeochemical cycles of soil
elements. The direct interplay between aqueous Fe(II) (Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i>) and
the structural Fe(III) in iron (hydr)oxide is the recently found
important process of soil iron cycle. Previous studies focused on the
chemical mechanism of Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i>-induced recrystallization and phase
transformation of iron (hydr)oxide. However, microorganism often
coexists with iron (hydr)oxide in the soil environment, and plays an
important role in the iron cycle process. The effect of microorganisms,
especially iron-reducing bacteria, on the interplay between Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i>
and the structural Fe(III), and the phase transformation of iron
(hydr)oxide remain unclear. In this study, we focus on the effect of
iron-reducing bacteria, <i>Shewanella oneidensis</i> MR-1 (hereafter MR-1),
and herein the influencing mechanisms on the phase transformation of
lepidocrocite induced by Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i>. Enriched <sup>57</sup>Fe isotope tracer
studies demonstrate that Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i> undergoes electron transfer and
atom exchange with lepidocrocite, and results in 63.5% of structural
Fe(III) atoms in lepidocrocite exchanging with 1.0 mM Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i> in
solution at pH 7.0 for 23 days. XRD analysis results show that part of
lepidocrocite is transformed into goethite after 23 days incubation.
Interestingly, amended with Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i> and active cells (MR-1),
lepidocrocite can be reduced and the concentration of Fe(II) in solution
increases quickly, which further enhance the rate of Fe atom exchange.
Lepidocrocite is transformed into magnetite during this process.
However, MÃ¶ssbauer analysis results show that lepidocrocite could be
recrystallized as lepidocrocite and goethite after incubation 23 days in
the abiotic experiment of Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i> and lepidocrocite, and
lepidocrocite, goethite and magnetite were found in the presence of
MR-1. Hence, we could infer that the presence of iron-reducing bacteria
could change the Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i> concentration which would further change
the iron atom exchange and phase transformation of lepidocrocite. The
initial Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i> could exchange with lepidocrocite directly, and
lepidocrocite was recrystallized as lepidocrocite and goethite; or
coupled with Fe(II)<i><sub>aq</sub></i> produced by iron-reducing bacteria, exchanged
with structural Fe(III), and lepidocrocite was recrystallized as
magnetite.

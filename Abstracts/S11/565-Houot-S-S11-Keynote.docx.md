<p style=text-align:justify>Today, the recycling of organic wastes (OW) in agriculture has been
largely encouraged since it makes possible to recycle the nutrients they
contain as substitute to mineral fertilizers. As an example in 2017,
25%, 54% and 71% of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium applied on
cultivated soils have been applied as organic fertilizers issued from
organic wastes, respectively in France. Additionally, the associated
input of organic matter could also contribute at increasing soil organic
carbon stocks, thus improving soil fertility and potential climate
change mitigation. The main sources of organic wastes are of
agricultural origin with all animal manures, but also of industrial
origin (agro-industries or other) or urban origins (food wastes, green
wastes, sewage sludges…). If agricultural and industrial wastes are
largely recycled in agriculture, the recycling of urban wastes is
strongly encouraged after biological treatments (composting or anaerobic
digestion). Finally, urban sewage sludges are also recycled in
agriculture in many countries. If these recycling participate to
circular economy, such practice needs to be proved to have no adverse
impacts on soil, crop and water qualities. The objective is to focus on
trace element (TE) contents in these organic fertilizers and the
consequences of their repeated application on TE contents in soils,
their potential transfers to crops and soil solutions then to food chain
and ground waters.

<p style=text-align:justify>A network of long-term field experiments (SOERE-PRO) have been created
among French research institutes, to quantify, explain and be able to
predict the consequences of repeated fertilization with OW on soil and
water qualities and on crop production and quality. The SOERE-PRO
included different pedoclimatic conditions including temperate and
tropical conditions, various OW including animal manures and slurries,
sewage sludge composted or not, biowaste composts and digestates… with
some experiments as old as 1998.

<p style=text-align:justify>TE bioavailability for crops and mobility in soils depend on their
speciation in OW and soils but also on soil characteristics such as pH
and soil organic matter content or dissolved organic matter content in
soil solution. The SOERE-PRO will be presented, and also examples of
results of TE mass balance, interactions between impacts (pH and TE
mobility for example), soil biological activities, evolution of TE
contents in soil, crop and water since 20 years. Finally, questions will
be asked from the end-user and agronomist point of vue on the
development of pertinent risk indicators.

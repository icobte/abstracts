<p style=text-align:justify>Ball-milled biochar with enhanced physicochemical and sorption
properties has been intensively investigated, but its photochemistry
property was far less studied. In this study, biochars from various
pyrolysis temperatures were ball milled and tested for enrofloxacin
(EFA) photocatalytic degradation and mechanisms. Ball-milled biochar
could generate more •O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> under visible light irradiation, which
favored the photocatalytic degradation of EFA. The ball-milled biochar
pyrolyzed at 300 ℃ (BM300) exhibited the highest EFA degradation rate
(66.3% compared to 13.9% for unmilled biochar). Characterization results
suggested that the higher specific surface area and smaller particles
size facilitated the adsorption of EFA molecules, while the abundant
defects, more oxygen functional groups and persistent free radicals
(PFRs) played significant role in the generation of reactive oxygen
radicals (ROS), which benefited the enhancement of photocatalytic
performance. Radical trapping experiments and electron paramagnetic
resonance (EPR) technique confirmed that •O<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and h<sup>+</sup> were the main
active species in the photocatalytic degradation process. Based on the
characterization and experiment results, a possible photocatalytic
mechanism and degradation pathway of EFA by BM300 was proposed. This
work promoted the BM biochar technology through improving current
understanding of the fundamental processes and mechanisms that govern
the photochemistry properties of BM-biochar. It provides new
opportunities for the application of ball milling in environmental
remediation.

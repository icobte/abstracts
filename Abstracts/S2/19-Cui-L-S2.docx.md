<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium contamination in waters and soils can lead to food chain
accumulation and ultimately human health degradation; means for reducing
bioavailable Cd are desperately required, and biochars may play a role.
Long-term lab incubation experiments were utilized to explain wheat
straw-derived biochar (0, 5, and 15% by wt.) effects on Cd sorption and
decreasing Cd bioavailability in soils and solutions, and to identify Cd
forms present using both the European Community Bureau of Reference
(BCR) chemical sequential extraction procedure and synchrotron-based
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Biochar Cd removal was up to ~90%
from Cd-containing solutions and contaminated soil as compared to the
control. Based on the wet chemical sequential extraction procedure in
conjunction with XAS, biochar application promoted the formation of
(oxy)hydroxide, carbonate, and organically bound Cd phases. As a
material, biochar may be promoted as a tool for reducing and removing
bioavailable Cd from contaminated waters and soils, potentially
improving environmental and human health.

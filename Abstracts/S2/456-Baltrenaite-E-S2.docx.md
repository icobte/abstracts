<p style=text-align:justify>Despite considerable reduction in hydrologic and atmospheric emissions,
the consumption of metallic elements (MEs) is increasing and, therefore,
their amount in the products used and in the waste streams is also
growing. Therefore, the level of the environmental pollution of MEs and
their bioaccumulation in the living matter, have increased. This is a
new syngenetic mechanism of MEs penetration into biomass. The increase
in the amount of MEs in biomass and its products, which can be used for
decreasing the level of pollution, causes the changes in their
properties.

<p style=text-align:justify>The growing demand for organic products in the market promotes their use
in various fields. One of such products is biochar. Among the innovative
environmental applications, biochar has the potential as an adsorbent
for retaining contaminants in environmental engineering and
agrotechnical systems. Natural lignocellulosic and biochar composition
variations would lead to a new field of application of biochar and
reduce resources for biochar modifications. The aim of this study was to
determine influence of syngenetic MEs on the adsorptive properties and
adsorption performance of lignocellulosic biochar. Evaluating biochar as
a potential adsorbent of inorganic pollutants, its valuable adsorbing
properties and the influence of syngenetic MEs on their strengthening
will be discussed.

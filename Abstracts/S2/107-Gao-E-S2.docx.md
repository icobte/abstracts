<p style=text-align:justify>The spatial resolved analysis of trace elements offers a deeper
understanding of solid samples and thus of processes that lead to
formation or transformation of e.g. geological samples. Since small spot
sizes improve the resolution a high sensitive detection is key for this
kind of applications. With the high sensitivity ICP-MS allows the use of
smaller spot-sizes to improve the resolution and precision. The Tandem
LA – LIBS instrument provides the unique capability of combining the
analytical benefits of both LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation-Inductively
Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry) and LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown
Spectroscopy). LIBS can be used for the analysis of H – Pu, which
includes non-metals such as H, N, O, and halogens that are difficult or
impossible to analyze by a conventional ICP-MS instrument. When coupled
with an ICP-MS instrument, it can perform LA-ICP-MS measurements
focusing on trace elemental and isotopic ratio compositions. The
abstract should give the motivation for the study, a brief statement on
the state of the knowledge, the open question that was addressed,
eventually a hypothesis, the methodological approach taken to answer the
question and/or thest the hypothesis, the main result(s) and the
conclusion with respect to the new knowledge gained and eventual
implications for application on further research.

<strong>Sample analysis</strong>

<p style=text-align:justify>The mineral sample was used to assess the ability of the tandem
instrument in combination with the high sensitive ICP-MS. A 16 mm<sup>2</sup>
area was analyzed using laser spot size of 85 μm (diameter) and spacing
of 115 μm between locations.

<strong>Conclusion</strong>

<p style=text-align:justify>LIBS was demonstrated as a means for detecting fluorine and oxygen in
REE-rich mineral samples. These are analytes that are difficult or
impossible to detect through other atomic spectroscopy techniques.
Interfacing the tandem instrument with high sensitive ICP-MS enabled
more complete elemental mapping of the investigated mineral. Elemental
mapping of the sample using the data analysis software allowed for easy
integration of the LIBS and LA data to create contour plots as shown in
the aforementioned sections. The high sensitivity ICP-MS was ideal for
trace level elemental and isotopic mapping analysis, since LA-ICP-MS
often involves very small quantity of sampled mass, especially when high
spatial resolution is desired.

<p style=text-align:justify>Biochars have been proposed as soil amendments based on research
indicating beneficial effects of biochar addition on various processes
such as trace element retention, mitigating greenhouse gas emission, and
increasing carbon sequestration in soil. In particular, acidic soil
exhibiting low cation exchange capacities and low base saturation
percentages were found to be ameliorated by biochar additions. In
tropical regions, strongly weathered acidic soil such as ferralsols and
acrisols are very abundant. In Southeast Asia, acidic soils are often
used for growing oil palms, which are fairly tolerant to acidic
conditions and elevated Al concentrations in soil solution. Often acidic
soils are also used for rice production, being the staple food in
Southeast Asia.

<p style=text-align:justify>In this study, we aimed at assessing the suitability of biochars
produced from economic crop residues as soil amendments for acidic soils
in Thailand. Rice and oil palm residues were selected as the feedstock
materials for biochar production. Dialysis and acid-washing were applied
to reveal the contribution of the charred carbonaceous solids in
biochars to their reactivity as compared to the untreated biochars
containing inorganic solids. Two well-characterized biochars produced
from rice straw and chestnut wood were included as reference materials.
Titration experiments revealed a trend in reactivity of the biochars
with respect to cation binding of the charred carbonaceous solids in the
following order: rice straw&gt;oil palm fruit fibre&gt;rice
chaff&gt;&gt;oil palm shell. The reactivities were highly related to the
amounts of carboxylic carbon of the biochars as determined with FTIR
spectroscopy. Acid-soluble solid phases contained in the non-treated
biochars substantially contributed to the total reactivity. Their share
was strongly related to the intensities of C-O out of plane deformation
IR band of carbonates indicating that solid carbonates are major
reactant phases in biochars. Compared to reactivities reported for humic
materials, the values measured for all biochars investigated here were
low. Consequently, the investigated biochars have to be applied in high
quantities to make the biochars substantially contribute to trace
element sorption in soil. As the carbonates contained in biochars can
additionally support trace element retention in soils by increasing soil
pH and by acting as a sorbent we conclude that carbonate-rich biochars
are preferably suited as amendments for acidic tropical soils
contaminated with cationic trace elements such as Cd<sup>2+</sup>, Cu<sup>2+</sup>, and
Pb<sup>2+</sup>.

<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is a metalloid of growing environmental concern due to the
increased use in various products globally (e.g., flame retardants,
alloys, semiconductors, plastics, batteries). Antimony compounds are
released into the environment through mining, smelting activities,
combustion of fossil fuels and spent ammunition. Mobilization of Sb due
to mining activities is often associated with highly acidic condition.
Environmental fate of Sb in water depends on different factors such as
pH, redox potentials and other environmental conditions. Two predominant
forms of Sb present in water as oxyanions of which tri-valent Sb
(Sb(III)) tends to bind more strongly in neutral and alkaline soils than
pentavalent Sb (Sb(V)). However, the sorption of Sb(V) from aqueous
solution can be significant at low pH. Biochar, a solid by-product of
bio-refineries, is an emerging low-cost sorbent for environmental
contaminants. In this study, three biochar products were investigated
for their efficacy to sequester Sb(V), including biosolid (BS), cow
manure (CM) and horse manure (HM) biochar. Slow pyrolysis (300 °C, 30
min) was employed at a 7 °C min<sup>–1</sup> heating rate for biochar production.
Among the three biochars, the biosolid biochar was modified with
zirconyl chloride solution (biochar: solution = 1:10) as it was
hypothesized that the modification will enhance the sorption capacity.

<p style=text-align:justify>The sorption behavior of Sb(V) on BS, CM and HM biochar was investigated
using batch sorption techniques (sorbent dosage 2.5 g/L, temperature 25
°C). The sorption isotherms and pH edges indicated that the affinity of
Sb(V) toward the BS biochar was strongly dependent on solution pH and
biochar characteristics. Sorption of Sb(V) was favored at pH 1.0–2.0 as
a consequence of the high affinity between the positively charged
biochar surface and the predominant Sb species (Sb(OH)<sub>6</sub><sup>–</sup> and
Sb(OH)<sub>5</sub><sup>0</sup>). Increasing pH (4.0–8.0) resulted in a dramatic decrease
in the sorption (0–5% sorption of Sb(V)) efficiency. The Langmuir
isotherm model described experimental data well for Sb(V) (<i>R<sup>2</sup></i> =
0.97). The maximum sorption capacity (<i>Q<sub>m</sub></i>) of BS, CM and HM biochars
at pH 2.0 were 10.15, 4.06 and 4.94 mg/g, respectively.

<p style=text-align:justify>Zirconium (IV) modified biosolid biochar (ZMBS) enhanced Sb(V) sorption
by 3 fold greater than the unmodified biochar. In this investigation,
ZMBS performed well at pH 3.0–5.0 (maximum Sb removal efficiency found
at pH 4.0). ZMBS was not effective below pH 3.0. Thus, the unmodified BS
biochar shows that it has a great potential in removing Sb(V) from
acidic aqueous environments such as groundwater and acid mine drainage,
whilst ZMBS would be more suitable for less acidic waters, the more
commonly encountered environment. Further research on the chemical
modification of BS biochar is required to enhance the Sb(V) removal
efficiency.

<p style=text-align:justify>The ability of biochar to absorb trace elements have drawn a special attention in using biochar to remediate heavy metal contaminated soils. However, most studies focused only on soils contaminated mainly with
metals such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), aluminum (Al),
iron (Fe) and copper (Cu). Moreover, the main mechanism for their
decline is reported as the adsorption by biochar and their decreased
mobility at higher pH induced by biochar addition. However, we
hypothesized that the application of biochar in neutral soil with
elevated content of arsenic (As) could increase mobility of this
element.

<p style=text-align:justify>To achieve the objective, we have included three soils having different As, Cd and Mn contents. The selected soils are Luvisol (pH = 7.0, high
content of As), Cambisol (pH = 4.5, high content of Mn), and Fluvisol
(pH = 5.9, high Cd and Mn contents). Selected soils were incubated for
56 days in controlled conditions with four elevating rates of biochar
(0.5, 2, 4 and 8% w/w). Each treatment was set up in three replicates,
irrigated to 60% of maximum water holding capacity every other day and
samples were collected at 7<sup>th</sup>, 14<sup>th</sup>, 28<sup>th</sup> and 56<sup>th</sup> day of incubation and extracted with 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> (1:10 w/v) for the determination of available As, Cd and Mn contents.

<p style=text-align:justify>The application of biochar increased available As content in Luvisol.
The increment was significant especially at biochar application rate of
8% at the 56<sup>th</sup> day of incubation, while insignificant increment was
found in other treatments. The increment in available As content of
Luvisol is mainly attributed by higher original soil As content, the
increment in the soil pH by biochar addition and the higher As mobility
at higher pH. While in the rest soils (Cambisol and Fluvisol) available
As content was below detection limit of inductive coupled plasma–optical
emission spectrometer, ICP–OES). The availability of both Cd and Mn
significantly declined after the addition of 2, 4 and 8% of biochar
application rates at both Cambisol and Fluvisol at all sample collection
periods. The decline in available content of Cd and Mn mainly raised
from the increment in pH of both soils. In Luvisol it was only 8% of
biochar application, which induced a significant decline in available Cd
content and mostly inconsistent effect on available Mn content was
found. This low effect of biochar on Cd and Mn content at Luvisol was
probably due to very low soil content of these elements. Generally,
biochar was able to induce increment in available As content ranging
from 3.3 to 32%, decline in available Cd content ranging from 69 to 82%
and decline in available Mn content ranging from 69 to 89%. The changes
were substantially affected by soil type and properties of soils.

<p style=text-align:justify>Biochar could induce the decline in available soil Cd and Mn content,
while increase the available As content. Therefore, it is crucial to
investigate As content of soils before considering biochar as heavy
metal remediation tool at contaminated soils. Finally, we would like to
put our remark on further investigation of biochar effect on the
mobility of trace elements, with especial emphasis given to the soil As
content.

<p style=text-align:justify>Biochars have the proven capacity to sorb and thus reduce trace and
heavy metal bioavailability, with the intent to improve environmental
quality and human health. The majority of laboratory-based studies have
focused attention on one or two trace elements within soil or water
systems; what is desperately lacking are focused studies with the use of
biochar for metal sorption in mixed metal matrices (e.g., matrices that
might be found in urban or environmental runoff). We focused attention
on the use of five different biochars for trace/heavy metal sorption in
a mixed solution phase â€“ solutions contained varying amounts of biochar
in the presence of varying concentrations of Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Al, and Fe
(we are currently adding Cr, Ni, and Hg into the solution matrix). Our
intent was to quantify sorption phenomenon and maximum metal sorption in
the presence of other potentially competing metal ions. Results show
that biochar-heavy metal sorption varied considerably based, likely on,
inherent biochar properties. However, some of the best performing
biochars resulted in sorption of Al and Cu up to ~ 680 and 1140 mg/kg,
respectively. These high-performing biochars linearly sorbed Cd, Fe, Pb,
and Zn up to 100, 1400, 800, and 1200 mg/kg, respectively, with sorption
maximum not yet met. Sorption mechanisms are currently being quantified.
Regardless, some biochars obviously have the propensity to sorb a
multitude of heavy/trace metals in the presence of mixed metal solution
phases. These results suggest that biochars could be created or designed
to reduce metal bioavailability in mixed metal matrices, and ultimately
improve environmental quality.

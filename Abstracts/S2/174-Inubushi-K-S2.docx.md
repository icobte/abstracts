<p style=text-align:justify>Due to global warming in recent years, summer drought and heavy rain is
frequently reported. It is known that the wetting of dried soils during
several hours or days is accompanied by a sudden increase in the
microbial populations and a burst of CO₂ production. On the other hand,
biochar is focused to increase soil carbon storage. In this study, we
investigated the influence of short cycle of dry-wet repetition of soil
on greenhouse gas emission, together with biochar which is expected to
suppress greenhouse gas emission.

<center><strong>Materials and methods</strong>

<p style=text-align:justify>Incubation experiment was carried out with Andosols and Chernozems soil
collected in Japan and Hungary, respectively. Biochar (derived from rice
husk, commercially available in Japan, pyrolysis at 600 to 800 ℃ for 5
minutes) was applied at the rate of 0% or 1%(w/w) of oven dried soil.
Nitrogen fertilizer was applied to all treatments (100 kg N ha⁻¹). Moist
soil equivalent to 10g oven-dried soil was filled in closed bottles, and
aerobically incubated for 12 weeks at 20<sup>o</sup>C in dark place. The moisture
was kept constant during the incubation period (CM; Water Holding
Capacity (WHC) at 60%) or subjected to 6 cycles of drying and wetting
(DW: WHC was decreased from 60% to 30% in one week by silica gel).
Headspace gas samples were collected weekly to measure CO₂ and N₂O by
gas chromatography. Soil pH, NH₄⁺-N, NO₃⁻-N, microbial biomass c and N,
Total C, and Total N were also analyzed before, during and after
incubation.

<center><strong>Results and discussion</strong>

<p style=text-align:justify>The results shown that soil pH increased by biochar after incubation.
NO₃⁻-N increased more in CM than in DW, while at the end of incubation,
it leached almost the same level. The N₂O production was observed in
Chernozems at 1st and 7<sup>th</sup> day, higher with biochar in DW. On the other
hand, there were two peaks in N₂O production in Andosols, especially
higher without biochar and DW than with biochar and CM. Therefore,
impact of biochar on N₂O production was significant only in Andosols
soil. Relation to other trace gas is also discussed.

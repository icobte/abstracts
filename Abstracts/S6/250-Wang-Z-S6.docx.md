<p style="text-align:justify">Zinc (Zn) deficiency, threatening billions of people’s health, has
attracted worldwide concerns. Wheat is one of the most important staple
food crops, and the major source for human Zn nutrition. Dryland is
almost the main wheat production area in the world, but usually suffers
from the low soil Zn availability due to the high soil pH, the high soil
carbonate contents, and the frequent drought stress. Therefore,
optimizing cultivar, fertilizer and soil nutrient management is urgently
needed for stabilizing and increasing the wheat grain yield and
simultaneously the grain Zn concentration on calcareous soil in dryland.
In a three year field studies, cultivars with high grain yield were
selected from 123 wheat cultivars, and the variation of their grain Zn
concentration, reasons for high grain Zn concentration at high yield
levels and the potential for increasing the grain Zn concentration were
evaluated and explored. An in farm investigation together with soil and
plant sampling was carried out in 9 different sites of three provinces
in dryland wheat production areas in China from 2015-2018, to study the
farmer’s wheat yield and the grain micronutrient concentration
differences, and explore the grain Zn concentration difference at higher
yield levels. Also, samples were collected from a long term
location-fixed field experiment initiated in 2004, to explore the change
of wheat grain yield and its Zn concentration and soil available macro-
and micro-nutrients affected by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P)
application rates, for the purpose to understand the right N and P
application rates, corresponding soil available N, P and Zn nutrients
for a higher grain yield and higher grain Zn concentration. Obtained
results showed that, for high yielding cultivars, those with high grain
Zn concentration also showed high shoot and grain Zn uptakes and high Zn
harvest indexes. Analysis of straw Zn concentration showed that it
varied from 1.2 to 10.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Based on the established model
between grain Zn and straw Zn, and assumed that the straw Zn of the
high-yielding cultivars could be decreased to a lower level around 1.5
mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, their grain Zn concentrations would be able to increase to
40.0 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Results from the in farm investigation showed that,
wheat grain Zn concentration varied from 12.2 to 48.0 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for
high-yielding farmers, and the soil available N was higher and available
P was lower for the high grain Zn samples. Higher soil available
potassium (K) and lower soil available ferrum (Fe) were also found
beneficial for improving grain Zn concentration. The long term field
experiment showed that each 100 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup> increase of P
application rate could led to a decrease of wheat grain Zn by 9.2 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>, and for balancing the wheat grain yield and its Zn concentration
in dryland with calcareous soil and soil available Zn of 4.6 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>,
the N and P fertilizer rates should be maintained respectively at 160.0
kg N ha<sup>-1</sup> and 95.0 kg P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>, when the grain yield is around
6000 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>, its Zn concentration is at a relatively high level of
32.0 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, and soil available N and P are around 6.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and
12.0 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively at sowing. Our results showed the
possibility for improving wheat grain Zn concentration by enhancing the
Zn uptake from soil and its translocation from straw to grain by new
cultivar breeding and selection, and by optimizing the soil N, P, Fe and
Zn as well as the N and P fertilizer management in similar areas of
calcareous soil and dryland climate in the world.

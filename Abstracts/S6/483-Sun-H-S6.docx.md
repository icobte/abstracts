<p style="text-align:justify">Health of people living in the urban village must be payed attention in
developing country as results of the industrial pollution. People living
this area always eat the vegetables planted by themselves, which might
be exposures to a higher health risk as result of the heavy metals
pollution issues. However, to our knowledge, there are few studies on
investigating the latest presentation of this issue comparing that of
urban village and rural village. It is imperative to clarify the
transport relationship of heavy metals (such as Cd and As) from
soils/irrigation water, to vegetables and to humanâ€™s hairs. In the
current investigation work, we collected 83 hair samples, 16 soil
samples, 8 ditch sediments, 16 irrigation water, and 49 vegetable
samples in three urban villages and one rural village (as control)
located at Foshan, a developed industrial city in Southern China. The
pH, total C, total N and total P concentrations of soil and sediment
samples, meanwhile the Cd and As concentrations of all samples were
analysed. The results showed that both the Cd and As contents in human
hairs of urban village were higher than that of rural village (median
values, 0.036-0.038 <i>vs</i> 0.034 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, and 0.17 <i>vs</i> 0.19-0.23 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup> for Cd and As, respectively), indicating the human living in
urban village exposure to a higher health risk resulting from heavy
mental pollution. The As concentrations of the four most widely consumed
vegetables (i.e., Chinese flowering cabbage, leaf lettuce, sweet potato
vine and India lettuce) planted in urban village were 111-858 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>,
276-4150 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, 98.4-250 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 931-4485 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, which
were significantly higher than that planted in rural village (with 16.3
mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, 236 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, 4.65 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and 220 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>,
respectively). Most of people buy other eatable food including meat,
fish and rice from market, therefore, the vegetables containing high
level of Cd and As potentially led to their health risk. Soils collected
from the four villages contained Cd and As with 0.375-0.657 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>
and 10.2-16.8 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Farmers of urban village did not
care of the cost and applied quantity of fertilizer exceeding demand of
vegetable plants because the size of their vegetable garden was so small
(even less than 20 m<sup>2</sup>). Consequently, the vegetable soils of urban
villages were acidized dramatically and with 0.39-1.02 lower pH than
that of rural village. Lower pH activated the Cd and As contained in
soils and thereafter increased the Cd and As uptake by vegetable plants.
In addition, nearby ditch sediments (even containing more Cd and As than
soils) and Cd/As polluted river water were used as organic fertilizer
and irrigation water were other two main sources of Cd and As in
vegetable. In conclusion, human living in urban village were exposure to
higher health risk as results of their self-supplied vegetables planted
in Cd and As polluted soils with so small size and re-contaminated by
irrigation water and ditch sediment, which is a new insight to urban
village in developing countries.

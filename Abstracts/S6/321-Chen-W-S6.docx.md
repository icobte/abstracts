<p style="text-align:justify">Silicate weathering in terrestrial ecosystems plays an important role in
the formation of soil and soil nutrients, in neutralization of acid
rain, and in the long-term drawdown of atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>. Many studies
indicate that bacteria can signiﬁcantly affect mineral dissolution by
different ways, such as producing acids and metal-complexing ligands,
changing redox conditions, or mediating the formation of secondary
mineral phases. Exopolysaccharides are also reported to be related to
mineral weathering. The probable mechanisms included chelating the
structural elements, breaking chemical equilibrium by absorbing ions,
forming biofilm and so on. However, there are little reports on the key
genes involved in this process. So, this study focuses on the
mineral-weathering genes.

<p style="text-align:justify">A high effective mineral-weathering bacterium, strain M78, was isolated
from the adjacent soil of purple siltstone in Yanting, Sichuan Province,
China. Potash feldspar which is one of the main silicates in purple
siltstone was used as the test mineral. The dissolved elements of Fe, Si
and Al by this strain in two days turned out to be 0.45 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, 0.38
mg L<sup>-1</sup> and 0.13 mg L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The result of the 16S rDNA
sequencing showed that strain M78 belonged to the species of <i>Ensifer
adhaerens.</i> The production of exopolysaccharides of strain M78 was
0.82±0.01 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, which we presumed to be the main factor responsible
for the mineral-weathering efficiency. We used transposon insertion
method to screen for the genes involved in mineral weathering. A
mutation library was built, and the mutants with significantly declined
production of exopolysaccharides were the target of screening. We got
three target mutants (T3, T6 and 10), the exopolysaccharides productions
of which were 0.37±0.07 mg mL<sup>-1</sup>, 0.31±0.01 mg mL<sup>-1</sup> and 0.29±0.06 mg
mL<sup>-1</sup>. The functional groups on the surface of exopolysaccharides were
compared between the mutants and the wild type by fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy. The result showed mutants T3 and T6 could produce
different exopolysaccharides compared to wild type. The genome walking
and genome-wide scanning were taken to locate the inserted genes. The
results showed that the inserted genes of the mutants were found to be
<i>ctrA</i>, <i>yfiH</i> and <i>kspE</i> coding cell cycle response regulator,
polyphenol oxidase, capsule polysaccharide ABC transporter permease,
respectively. According to the different characters between the mutants
and the wild type, we suggest that <i>ctrA</i>, <i>yfiH</i> and <i>kspE</i> may be
involved in the mineral-weathering through the process of synthesis and
transportation of the exopolysaccharides in different ways.

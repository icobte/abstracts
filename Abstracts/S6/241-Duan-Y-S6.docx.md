<p style="text-align:justify">Since discovered at Freiberg by Clemens Winkler in 1886, germanium and
some of its compounds have found a variety of applications due to their
unique physical and chemical properties. Its fields of application range
from semi-conductor industries, optical and telecommunication industries
to applications in the biomedical field as well as geological research.
Taking into account the constantly expanding market and increasing
applications of Ge, its geochemical characteristics and spatial
distribution in various natural materials (rocks, soil, water) is of
great significance for the assessments of the mineral resource potential
and for environmental purposes. Nevertheless, reliable soil Ge data are
still rare in the literature mainly due to the low abundance of Ge with
1.7ppm background of soils in China. The primary aim of this research is
to depict the distribution of Ge in Beibu Gulf top and deep soils and
find out the factors effecting its distribution which will provide a
base for deeper geochemical study of Ge in soils. The concentrations of
Ge in soils were determined by AFS, and their spatial distribution
patterns generated using a GIS software. Besides, the main mineral
phases in soils were identified by XRD.

<p style="text-align:justify">It is concluded that soil Ge concentrations are mainly controlled by
lithology of the bedrock, as the soils derived from carbonates and
granites usually have the highest Ge concentrations. In addition, soil
parameters like TOC, clay minerals also have noticeable influence on Ge
concentrations. Al–bearing minerals (including kaolinite and a few
gibbsite) play a primary role in Ge accumulation in the soils derived
from granites. By contrast, in the soils derived from carbonates,
quaternary sediments, sandstones and shales, soil Ge is mainly rich in
both Al–bearing and Fe–bearing minerals(mainly goethite), and soil
organic matter may also lead to high level of Ge in top soils. Whereas,
quartz always result in a low level of Ge in soil.

<p style="text-align:justify">As soil is a huge nature pool for Ge, to make full use of soil Ge, the
further research should focus on which soil fractions are the dominantly
available parts sequestrating Ge in soils with various bedrocks, what
methods could be used to accumulate Ge and extract it from soil. In
addition, in order to figure out if crops fostered on Ge-rich soils can
uptake Ge and how these crops will effect on human health, there is a
need for future studies on the uptake mechanisms and stoichiometry of Ge
uptake under field conditions and plant-soil-microbe interactions in the
rhizosphere as well as the chemical speciation in different plant parts.

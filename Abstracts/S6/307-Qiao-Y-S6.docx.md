<p style="text-align:justify">Mature wheat seeds are physiologically devoted to storing nutrients, in
which mineral nutrients are unevenly distributed in different parts,
reflecting their storage mechanisms, structural characteristics and
physiological functions. Therefore, it is important to study the
distribution and bioavailability of mineral nutrients in the wheat
grains.

<p style="text-align:justify">Based on Nano-XRF (X-ray fluorescence mapping with the nano-sized
spatial resolution) imaging technology, this study characterized the
distribution of vital elements, such as zinc (Zn), iron (Fe),
calcium(Ca), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P) etc., in the wheat grain during
the period of development at cellular and subcellular levels.

<p style="text-align:justify">Detailed images of a large amount of nutrient storage were shown
directly in the scutellum. While some specific elements, such as Zn, was
sequestrated in the embryo. Moreover, the granular accumulation patterns
of micronutrients such as Zn, Fe and manganese (Mn) were demonstrated as
phytates in the aleurone layer, explaining the limited mobility of them;
Ca also existed in the starchy endosperm as hot spots, which were
possibly presented as calcium oxalate. These results indicated that the
immobilization of intracellular metals affected the bioavailability. In
addition to physiological functions, Ca is distributed in the cell wall
of pericarp cells, revealing the maintenance of the cell structures.
Sulfur distribution was special, contained in the protein storage
vacuole of endosperm cells. It plays a key role in the storage mechanism
of proteins in the endosperm of wheat grain.

<p style="text-align:justify">Nano-XRF imaging technology, a high spatial technique, highlight how in
situ analysis can provide direct evidence for the complexity of element
distribution in wheat grains and generate new insights into structural
characteristics. Physiological researches are combined with the further
development of imaging technology to better understand the mechanism of
element distribution and storage in wheat grains. The significantly
heterogeneous and distinctive accumulation patterns of these elements
signify different transport process and storage capacities among
different cell types. These studies will provide basic knowledge for
improving nutritional values and agronomic practices for
biofortification.

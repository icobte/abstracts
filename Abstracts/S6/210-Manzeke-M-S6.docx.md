<p style="text-align:justify">Micronutrient deficiencies remain prevalent in food systems of southern
Africa, although advances in biofortification through crop breeding and
agronomy provide opportunities to address these. We determined baseline
soil availability of zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) and the effects of soil
type and farmer management on extractable soil Zn and Fe and subsequent
concentration in cereal and legume grains under two contrasting
agro-ecologies in Zimbabwe. Soil and crop surveys were conducted in
Hwedza and Mutasa Districts of Zimbabwe in 2015-16 on 350 farms over
different soil types and sampling within farms on fields with different
levels of productivity (designated as “most” and “least” productive
fields), using an inherited hierarchical randomized sampling design.
Grain Zn and Fe concentration in maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), sorghum (<i>Sorghum
bicolor</i>), finger millet (<i>Eleusine coracana</i>) and cowpea (<i>Vigna
unguiculata</i>) were insufficient for adequate human nutrition. The Linear
Mixed Effects (LME) model revealed that diethylene triamine penta-acetic
acid- (DTPA) extractable soil Zn concentration and grain Zn
concentration were largely affected by field productivity level.
DTPA-extractable soil Zn concentration was more than double on most
productive fields (mean 0.8 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) than least productive fields and
translated to up to 42.4 mg grain Zn kg<sup>-1</sup>. An interaction effect of
field productivity level and total soil Zn concentration on
DTPA-extractable soil Zn concentration suggests potential contribution
of organic matter management to unlocking unavailable forms of soil Zn.
DTPA-extractable soil Fe and grain Fe concentration were largely
affected by soil type and crop type, respectively. In Hwedza, clay soils
had larger DTPA-extractable Fe concentration of 16.0 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> while
sandy soils had DTPA-extractable soil Fe concentration of 12.6 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>. The LME modelling approach reveals soil geochemical covariates
affecting DTPA-extractable soil Zn and Fe concentration and grain Zn and
Fe concentration within Districts. Future studies can therefore be
powered to detect their roles at wider spatial scales for sustainable
management of crop Zn and Fe nutrition.

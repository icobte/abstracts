<p style="text-align:justify">Maize (<i>Zea mays L.</i>) plays an important role in food production in the
world. Maintaining adequate micronutrient concentrations in maize grains
is of great importance for food quality and human health. The aim of
this study was to investigate the spatial distribution and
bioavailability of micronutrients in soils and maize grains in major
crop production areas in China, where knowledge is limited, and further
to identify the main environmental factors affecting micronutrient
concentrations in maize grains.

<p style="text-align:justify">Totally, 995 maize grain and soil samples from famersâ€™ field were
collected in 2017 from 202 counties in four major maize agro-climatic
regions of China. Information on grain yield and cultivation management
were also collected for each field. Concentrations of Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu
in grain and soil properties including pH, total N, Olsen-P, available
K, organic matter, and concentrations of DTPA-extractable Fe, Zn, Mn and
Cu Were determined.

<p style="text-align:justify">Concentrations of DTPA-extractable micronutrients varied greatly with
maize production areas, being higher for soils in southwest of China
which were acid soils with high organic matter content. Analyses of
variance across different areas revealed significant genotypic and
environmental effects for grain micronutrient concentrations and grain
yield. Average micronutrient concentrations in maize grain were 17.3 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup> (range 5.0-51.7) for Fe, 17.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (range 6.2-35.1) for Zn,
1.49 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (range 0.07-4.66) for Mn and 4.86 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (range
1.90-10.50) for Cu, respectively. Compared to the biofortification
target values of 60 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for Fe and 38 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> for Zn, all
samples were considered inadequate to meet dietary requirement for
human. Grain Fe and Zn concentrations correlated significantly and
negatively with grain yield, and positively with growing degree days
(GDD) and soil DTPA-Fe and DTPA-Zn, respectively. The significantly
positive correlation between Zn and Fe concentrations suggest good
prospects of simultaneous improvement for both micronutrients.

<p style="text-align:justify">Our study provided the current status of bioavailability of
micronutrients in soil and maize grains in China. Quantifying the effect
of environmental factors on concentrations and bioavailability of
micronutrients in maize grains should be addressed in future research.

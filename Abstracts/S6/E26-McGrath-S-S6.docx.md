<p style="text-align:justify">This introduction is given on behalf of the GeoNutrition consortium who
are involved in a number of projects all aimed at improving the
micronutrient status of people in low income countries
<a herf:www.geonutrition.com> http://www.geonutrition.com</a>. Food production
has increased and needs to increase further, but undernutrition of
micronutrients (e.g. iron, zinc, selenium) and other essential
components of diets is also occurring. The high prevalence of
micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs) is a huge development challenge. For
example, deficiencies of Fe and Zn caused the loss of 862,000 and
117,000 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in Ethiopia in 2013, or
5.4% of total disease burdens.

<p style="text-align:justify">Biofortification efforts using agronomic and genetic approaches for crop
and human nutrition can help boost micronutrients in diets, but our
hypothesis is that their success is affected by soil conditions which
affect micronutrient bioavailability. It is therefore important to
identify the factors that affect micronutrient supply and to use the
understanding it to determine the limiting factors for nutrient supply.
However, many plant-based genetic approaches pay little consideration to
the environmental, and particularly soil aspects of bioavailability. We
have developed the concept of GeoNutrition, defined as how soil
conditions affect the nutrient content of smallholder-grown crops, and
consequently diets and human biomarkers of nutrient status. In order to
assess GeoNutrition, data and soils, climate, crop composition, dietary
intakes and human micronutrient status all need to be collected in areas
of interest. This is now possible using rapid methods for collecting and
analyzing multivariate data and establishing the relationships between
these different data layers.

<p style="text-align:justify">A number of research projects are now active in GeoNutrition, which
concentrate on developing soil-crop relationships and “hidden hunger” of
micronutrients. We have shown that human MND risks are widespread and
linked to soil type. For example, biomarker and food supply data show
that selenium (Se) and Zn deficiency risks exceed dietary iron (Fe)
deficiency risks for many groups. From collaborative research in Malawi,
evidence that human Se and Zn deficiency is linked to soil type was
obtained from: (1) soil and maize grain surveys; (2) cross-sectional
studies on intakes and status from contrasting soil types; (3)
continental-scale food systems analysis; (4) human biomarkers of status
such as plasma Se concentrations.

<p style="text-align:justify">Work on selenium and zinc mapping and prediction in Ethiopia and Malawi
are ongoing in BBSRC and BMGF-funded projects, as a prelude to dietary
intake studies, as well as biofortification trials and intervention
studies. The latter will entail households receiving Zn-biofortified
flour, Se-biofortified flour, or non-biofortified control flour.

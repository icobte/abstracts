<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic contamination of groundwater, soil and the consequent
accumulation in rice has become recognised as a serious environmental
problem in Bangladesh. Soil arsenic concentration has been found to vary
across the landscape of Bangladesh. The overall management of the paddy
soils play a critical role in the loading of arsenic into the soils,
with the paddy soils having a higher content of arsenic than the
adjacent non-irrigated soils, and soils irrigated with groundwater
having a higher content of arsenic than those irrigated with surface
water. While the surface waters in Bangladesh are at risk of toxic heavy
metals contamination from a range of anthropogenic sources, inputs of
toxic elements are expected in the paddy field soils irrigated by the
contaminated surface waters posing a threat to the food security of
Bangladesh. Moreover, land topological variations at the local level may
make the mobilization and retention of arsenic and other geochemical
elements more complex within the six inundation land types of
Bangladesh.

<p style="text-align:justify">Over 1200 surface paddy soil samples were collected from across
Bangladesh, which were categorized according to inundation land type
(highland, medium highland-1, medium highland-2, medium lowland,
lowland, and very lowland) and by source of irrigation water
(groundwater and surface water). While the groundwater irrigated paddy
soils had significantly higher arsenic contents than in the surface
water irrigated pddy soils, the contents of aluminium, cobalt, copper,
iron, potassium, magnesium, molybdenum, nickel, lead, sodium, and zinc
were significantly higher in the paddy soils irrigated with surface
waters compared to the soils irrigated with groundwater. Highly
significant variations (<sup>ANOVA</sup><i>F</i> = 24.74, <i>p</i> &lt; 0.001) in the paddy
soil arsenic contents were observed within the different inundation land
types, following the order of very lowland &gt; lowland &gt; medium
highland-2 &gt; medium lowland &gt; highland &gt; medium highland-1,
with the very lowland having the highest mean arsenic content of 9.95
mg/kg. Other geochemical elements analysed followed similar trends, with
the exception of cadmium (the highest in the medium highland-2 (0.24
mg/kg), followed by highland (0.21 mg/kg)) in the paddy soils. Soil pH
and the other geochemical elements analysed varied significantly (<i>p</i>
&lt; 0.001) across the inundation land types.

<p style="text-align:justify">This study revealed that irrigating paddy soils with surface waters in
Bangladesh increased toxic element loads in the soils. Elevated
accumulation of the toxic elements in the low-lying flooded soils due to
complex landscape topographical changes within the local areas poses a
substantial risk to the rice cultivation, which is extensively done in
those low level lands across Bangladesh. The present study thus gives
high importance to further investigation of spatial and temporal
variability and distribution of the geochemical elements in irrigated
paddy fields with respect to the inundation land types in Bangladesh.

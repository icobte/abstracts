<p style="text-align:justify">Zinc (Zn) deficiency is a worldwide problem among humans, especially
among those taking cereals as staple food. Soil Zn application is a
feasible approach to quickly and effectively increase grain Zn
concentration of wheat and maize, thereby benefit human health. However,
the effect of continuous soil Zn application on the health risk of heavy
metals is still unclear.

<p style="text-align:justify">To quantify the effects of continuous soil Zn application on the
potential health benefit and health risk of heavy metals, a field
experiment with six Zn rates (0, 2.3, 5.7, 11.4, 22.7 and 34.1 kg Zn
ha<sup>-1</sup>) was conducted in a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system
from 2009 in Quzhou county, Hebei province. The health benefit
(disability-adjusted life years , DALYs saved) of Zn and the human risk
of heavy metals in wheat and maize grains were quantitatively assessed
after 8 years’ soil Zn application.

<p style="text-align:justify">Results showed that both grain Zn concentration and Zn bioavailability
of wheat and maize were significantly increased as Zn rate increased. Meanwhile, the wheat
and maize grain in the treatments which had received fertilizer Zn
application have decreased by 8%-28% of current health burden in
optimistic scenario and 3%-9% in pessimistic scenario. The health risk
index (HRI) of Zn was significantly increased whereas that of arsenic
(As) and manganese (Mn) were decreased in response to the increase of Zn
concentration in wheat and maize grains. The HRI of lead (Pb) and
cadmium (Cd) were significantly increased in wheat grain while decreased
in maize grain. The hazard indexes of wheat and maize were not affected
by Zn application rates. The target cancer risk indexes of As in wheat
and maize grain were significantly decreased with the increase of Zn
rates. 

<p style="text-align:justify">In conclusion, Zn application can benefit human health without
increasing the risk of heavy metals. This study comprehensively
evaluated the effect of Zn fertilizer application on human health and
highlighted its particular importance in agricultural production.

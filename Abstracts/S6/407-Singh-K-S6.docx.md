<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Rice (<i>Oryza sativa L</i>.) is a major staple food crop consumed
worldwide. Currently 36.5% of Indian soils suffer from Zn deficiency
which might further escalate to 51.2% if soils under marginal
deficiencies are brought under intensive cultivation. Zinc deficiency in
soils does not only reduce crop productivity, but it also leads to
low-Zn food causing human malnutrition. The problem is global; however,
it is more acute in India as billions of people suffer from Zn
malnutrition.

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Objective:</strong> To bio-fortify rice grain with Zn through Zn fertilization to
tackle Zn malnutrition.

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Methods:</strong> Effectiveness of rice crop to be biofortified through foliar
applications of ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. 7H<sub>2</sub>O at boot and milk stages and basal Zn
application at the time of sowing was investigated under field
conditions at 25 sites years of Northern India. The concentration of Zn
in harvested whole grains was determined by AAS.

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Results & Discussion:</strong> Foliar spray of Zn fertilizer increased grain Zn
concentration from 21 to 62% and 20 to 61% over no Zn across all sites
during 2015 and 2016, respectively. A pooled cluster analysis data
showed significant mean increase in grain Zn concentration with foliar
spray of Zn (27.5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) than with no Zn (19.8 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). Grain
yield of wheat varied across years and among the selected field
locations. Soil Zn addition gave higher grain yield followed by foliar
Zn as compared to no Zn treatment. Foliar spray of Zn produced the
highest agronomic efficiency, Zn use efficiency apparent recovery of Zn
and utilization efficiency as compared to soil Zn application.

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The present field study clearly showed that rice grain can
be very easily be bio-fortified by foliar application of Zn fertilizers.
A novel and low cost fastest approach of agronomic biofortification of
rice grain with Zn was validated. This agricultural intervention
strengthens the links between agricultural research and human nutrition.

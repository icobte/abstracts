<p style="text-align:justify">Multiple micronutrient deficiency remains a health issue in developing
countries. The estimated risk of mineral deficiencies in Africa is
highest for Ca, Zn, Se, and I. A Se status assessment survey in the
rural central Kenya highlands recently conducted by our research group
revealed a high risk of dietary Se deficiency at 87% among under-5
children and 97% among women. Effective strategies are needed to reach
these rural communities whose diets depend on subsistence farming.
Therefore, this study investigated maize and bean crops’ response to Se
fertilization in the central Kenya highlands. The experiment comprises
of a soil and foliar Se fertilizer application, based on control, 5, 10,
and 20 g Se ha<sup>-1</sup> treatments. The effect of combining Se fertilizer
with P and N fertilizers, on Se concentration in grains is evaluated. A
full factorial experiment explores further the effect of combining Se
fertilizer with Zn and I fertilizers, on Se concentration in the grains.
Soil fertilizer application was conducted before sowing and foliar
fertilizer application during crop’s stem elongation stage. Compared to
the control, Se fertilizer application significantly increases Se
concentration in both maize and beans, and increases linearly with
increase in Se fertilizer application doses. In the soil application, Se
concentration increases on average by 0.008, 0.034, and 0.059 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>
in maize grains, and by 0.057, 0.108, and 0.165 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in bean
grains, for the 5, 10, and 20 g Se ha<sup>-1</sup> treatments respectively. The P
and N fertilizers have a positive effect on Se concentration in grains.
The foliar application results in significantly higher Se concentration
in grains, with Se concentration increasing on average by 0.123, 0.171,
and 0.272 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in maize grains, and by 0.353, 0.713, and 1.173 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup> in beans. Foliar application is therefore more effective. The
effect of Se fertilization varies across the study locations, and is
influenced by variation in soil characteristics, weather conditions, and
crop species. Crop’s response to Se fertilization is highest in Mbuyu,
implying that Se fertilization has more impact in locations at higher
risk of dietary Se deficiency. The study infers that, in locations at
high risk of dietary Se deficiency, a foliar Se fertilizer application
at 10 g Se ha<sup>-1</sup> on beans is sufficient to improve average dietary Se
intake to daily requirements among the local population. However, if
only maize crops are biofortified, a foliar Se fertilizer application of
20 g ha<sup>-1</sup> will instead be needed. In locations at lower risk of
dietary Se deficiency such as Mbeu and Kiaga, soil Se fertilizer
application at 10 g ha<sup>-1</sup> on beans crops is sufficient, or foliar Se
application below 5 g ha<sup>-1</sup>. Combining Se with Zn and I fertilizers
does not result in significant interaction effects on Se concentration
in grains. Selenium fertilizer treatment is the main variable with a
significant large effect on Se concentration in the grains. There is
therefore a leeway for a combined Se, Zn, and I agronomic
biofortification intervention aimed at addressing the existing
multi-mineral deficiencies.

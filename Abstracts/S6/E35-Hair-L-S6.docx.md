<p style="text-align:justify">The development of a method for high throughput analysis of human finger
and toe nail samples was required for the analysis of 4000 samples in
association with the BRAVE (Bangladesh Risk of Acute Vascular Events)
project. The aim of this project is to determine whether arsenic
metabolites influence cardiovascular disease by comparing the metabolite
concentrations in a control group and a group that have suffered stroke.
The main objectives of this part of the project were to test for an
extraction/digestion method that would allow for testing of total metals
without destroying arsenic metabolites, to overcome the problem of small
sample volume and to limit steps in sample preparation to reduce the
risk of contamination. Method development was carried out on human nails
of mixed ethnicity, which included digestion and buffer optimization and
gave recoveries between 80-120% of both organo-arsenic metabolites.
Areas of development that were identified after testing Bangladeshi nail
samples were matrix problems which necessitate buffer optimization and a
lack of homogeneity which may require different sample preparations
procedures.

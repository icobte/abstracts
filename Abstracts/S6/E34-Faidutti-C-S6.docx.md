<p style="text-align:justify">Coronary heart disease (CHD), and in particular myocardial infarction
(MI), is one of the leading causes of death in Bangladesh. The BRAVE
(Bangladesh Risk of Acute Vascular Events) study is a large-scale
case-control study aimed at investigating the effects of environmental,
genetic, lifestyle and biochemical factors on coronary heart disease in
Bangladesh.

<p style="text-align:justify">As part of the BRAVE study, toenail clippings were taken from each
participant. Toenails can be used as effective biomarkers of toxic
element exposure and mineral status, for several reasons, e.g.
non-invasive collection, easy storage and transport, resistance to
decay, limited exogenous exposure, and no fluctuation in element levels
due to metabolic activities (unlike blood). The analysis of the toenail
samples includes a number of procedures that aims at limiting the
ambiguity of external contamination: sampling with questionnaire,
washing, digestion, ICP-MS estimation of element concentrations, and
interpretation with statistical analysis.

<p style="text-align:justify">In this study, the cleaning protocol included the use of different
solvents in sequence: acetone, milli-Q water and 0.5% Triton X-100
solution, a non-ionic detergent. For a number of samples, each rinse
solution was retained for analysis by ICP-MS, to ensure an effective
removal of exogenous contaminants. The obtained data of this study have
so far showed high elemental variabilities amongst samples.
Additionally, replicates have been analysed for a selection of
specimens, with the analysis showing strong heterogeneity of the toenail
samples, for elements such as Mn, Co and Mo. A procedure with LA-ICP-MS
has been developed to investigate element distributions within nail
samples, with focus given to surface and interior layers of the
toenails. Future work will be focused on the analysis of the remaining
batches, for total element concentration with ICP-MS and spatial element
distribution in a selection of samples with LA-ICP-MS.

<p style="text-align:justify">Wheat is one of the stable food crops, has low zinc (Zn) concentration
in grain generally, thus biofortification of Zn in wheat grain has
attracted great attention in recent years. Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus
(P) fertilization are common practices to harvest high crop yield, and
also bring about influence on crop Zn nutrition. This review focuses on
N and P fertilization on soil Zn availability and wheat Zn uptake and
utilization 1) to evaluate N and P fertilization on grain Zn
concentration and bioavailability, and 2) to explore the possibility of
improving grain Zn nutrition by optimizing N and P management. Nitrogen
fertilization increased grain Zn concentration and bioavailability. Soil
Zn available increased by N fertilization, and it also enhanced root
uptake, root to shoot translocation and remobilization from vegetative
parts to grain, due to that various proteins and nitrogenous compounds
played important roles in Zn uptake, translocation and remobilization.
Phosphorus fertilization decreased grain Zn concentration and
bioavailability on soil with low available P. Soil available Zn did not
decrease by P fertilization when available P was lower than 34 and 200
mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in acid and calcareous soil. At lower P rate, wheat Zn uptake
also did not reduce, and even increased Zn remobilization from
vegetative parts to grain resulting in grain Zn uptake increase. The
decrease in grain Zn concentration was mainly ascribed to the dilution
effect caused by much more grain yield increase. In China, fertilizer
input is undergoing a transformation from the overuse to reasonable
input. Optimal N management by decreased N fertilization rate with high
grain yield might lead grain Zn decrease in Zn-deficient soil, and
optimal P management was required to harvest more grain Zn with high
grain yield in wheat-dominant areas. In order to harvest 40 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>
required for human health, apart from N and P management, Zn
supplementation to soil or foliar should not neglect in wheat grain.

<p style="text-align:justify">Recently, a “modified one health” approach has emerged aiming to expand
the original “one health” concept from animal and human health to
include soil and plant health. This is a needed shift that brings
attention to the importance of the health of the entire food production
system for human health. Nearly all nutrients composing food originated
through farming systems from soil to plants to grain and either directly
to humans or indirectly from animals to humans. Thus, the way in which
we manage any component in this farming system not only effects the
quantity of the food that we consume but also the quality. However, this
principle is often contentious and over simplified to imply that
increasing the nutrient content in the soil will increase the nutrient
content in the plant, grain, and ultimately the nutrient status of the
human population that consumes food from this system. This is rarely the
case. There are numerous chemical and biological interactions that
confound these interactions and should be investigated. In 2013 and
2014, 87 maize fields in the Great Plains of the United States were
surveyed and sampled for nutrient status of the soil (0-20 cm), plant
(VT-R3), and grain (physiological maturity) and their relationship to
grain yield. All samples were collected within a 15 x 10 m area in maize
fields having no known yield limiting constraints. Soil and plant
samples were collected at the same time. Agronomic standard extractants
and detection methods were used for soil, plant, and grain nutrients
analyses. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated for each
chemical relationship (i.e. plant x plant, plant x soil, plant x grain,
soil x soil, soil x grain, grain x grain) and correlated with yield. For
the purposes of this paper, we will primarily focus on the Zn and Fe
results. Soil NO<sub>3</sub>, P, B, Cu, Fe, and Zn did not have significant
positive correlations with their nutrient concentrations in plant
tissue. All grain nutrient concentrations and grain protein
concentration had negative correlations with grain yield, though there
was a strong positive correlation of grain nutrient uptake with grain
yield. As yield increased, grain K, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn and protein
concentrations decreased while total grain nutrient content increased.
Plant nutrient concentrations had little correlation with the
corresponding nutrient concentrations in grain, however, soil nutrient
status of P, K, S, and Zn each had significant positive correlations
with their corresponding nutrient concentration in grain. Though these
relationships are likely not universal across different locations with
different soil types, plant species, management practices and other
biogeochemical conditions, these results highlight the complex
interactions connecting the nutrient status of soil, plant and grains.
Additionally, these results highlight the need for greater consideration
of yield and grain nutrient interactions. Though total grain nutrient
content increased with increasing yield, grain nutrient concentration
declined with increasing yield, which is of greater concern for human
health. Grain nutrient concentration drives human nutrient consumption–
not grain nutrient content. Further research should be conducted to
quantify these relationships between soil, plant, grain and grain yield.

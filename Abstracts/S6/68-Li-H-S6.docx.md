<p style="text-align:justify">Selenium (Se) is an essential element for humans, whereas cadmium (Cd)
is a highly toxic heavy metal to both plants and animals. Because of the
different charges of Cd (Cd<sup>2+</sup>) and Se (SeO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> / SeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), they
are taken up by plants through different channels or transporters, so
they may not exhibit competition on root surface. However, numerous
studies have indicated that Se can regulate Cd uptake into plants.
Considering the tested plants, Se forms and different experimental
conditions, the results are sometimes paradoxical. Therefore, in this
study we investigated the effect of different forms of Se on Cd uptake,
transportation and transformation by different plants grown in varied
conditions.

<p style="text-align:justify">The concentration-dependent uptake kinetics of Cd into rice and pak choi
roots were affected by Se addition. Compared with that of no Se
addition, selenite slightly promoted Cd influx into rice roots, while
selenate had no effect. However, both selenite and selenate remarkably
enhanced Cd uptake kinetics in pak choi; the maximum Cd uptake rates
increased by more than 100%.

<p style="text-align:justify">Although Se promoted the Cd influx into the roots of plants during short
term exposure, Cd translocation from roots to shoots in plants was
effectively reduced by Se addition with long time exposure. Se decreased
Cd uptake and transportation from rice roots to shoots with prolonged
exposure time, but the decreasing degree varied with both Se forms and
doses. Selenite was more effective than selenate in decreasing Cd uptake
and translocation. As the selenite levels in the treatment solutions
increased, Cd uptake and translocation were both significantly reduced,
while the inhibiting effect was more significant at lower levels of
selenate. Different results were obtained from the vegetable. Regardless
of the exposure time or Cd doses, selenite decreased both the
translocation of Cd from pak choi roots to shoots, whereas selenate
increased Cd translocation.

<p style="text-align:justify">Cd subcellular compartmentalization (namely, cell walls, organelles, and
the soluble fraction), as affected by Se, was also investigated.
Selenite addition significantly decreased Cd content in different
subcellular fractions and organelles in rice root, while it increased
the proportion of Cd distributed to soluble cytosol. When selenate was
added, only the Cd distribution ratio of cytosol was increased. As for
pak choi, selenite and selenate enhanced Cd sequestration by the shoot
cell walls by 20% and 59%, respectively. However, Se caused opposite
effects on Cd sequestration on the root cell walls; selenite enhanced it
by 9%, while selenate reduced it by 22%, compared to the non-Se
treatment.

<p style="text-align:justify">Generally, selenite and selenate affected Cd accumulation and
translocation in plants by altering Cd subcellular distribution or other
uncertain mechanisms; such effects depended on the Se forms and doses,
and the tested plants.

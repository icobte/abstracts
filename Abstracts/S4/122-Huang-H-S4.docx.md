<p style=text-align:justify>Contamination of paddy soils with Cd and the subsequent production of
Cd-contaminated rice grains are the main sources exposing Cd pollution
to the food chain globally. Paddy fields are characterized with periodic
flooding and drainage, which have a substantial impact upon the
solubility of Cd in soils. The elevated Cd concentrations in rice grains
are mainly attributed to the enhanced mobilization of Cd during
pre-harvest drainage, with this period coinciding with grain filling
stage. There are substantial variations among the soils in the release
rates of Cd once soils are drained, but the underlying mechanisms remain
unclear. In this study, we used sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) to
synthesize Cd and Zn sulfides with different Zn/Cd ratios (0-600 on a
molar basis). Using a microcosm incubation system simulating the
occurrence of typical flooded/drained processes, we added these
synthetic sulfides into the flooded soils to investigate the release of
Cd in the subsequent oxidation process. Our results show that a higher
Zn/Cd ratio leads to a lower Cd release during the oxidation phase under
different pH conditions. When the Zn/Cd ratio is higher than 200, little
of Cd is released. These results indicate an important role of the ratio
of Zn/Cd in sulfides formed in the reducing soil in the subsequent
release of Cd during soil drainage. Enhancing the ratio of Zn/Cd in the
sulfides may provide a strategy to mitigate Cd accumulation in rice
grains.

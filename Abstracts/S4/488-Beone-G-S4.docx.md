<p style=text-align:justify>The aim of this study is to assess the influence of various industrial
processes on total Arsenic (TAs) and inorganic Arsenic (iAs) in rice
grains, from brown rice to white rice, with application of parboiling
treatment and polishing process. The location of TAs in rice grains has
been evaluated by laser ablation-inductively coupled mass spectrometry
(LA-ICP-MS) and ICP-MS, while arsenic speciation has been determined
using high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled mass
spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS).

<p style=text-align:justify>In this work, 256 samples were analysed for TAs and As speciation (only
some representative samples by LA-ICP-MS), representing two European
commercial categories (Long A grain and Long B grain groups) and 15
varieties according to their use for parboiling processes. Out of them,
53 sample pairs of paddy rice and corresponding parboiled paddy rice
were collected directly from different Italian rice millers. Polished
and brown rice aliquots of the same sample were also compared for TAs
and As speciation.

<p style=text-align:justify>This investigation shows that the polishing process, besides modifying
the physical characteristics of rice, decreases the concentration of As
compared to the brown rice. Indeed, there was a statistically higher
arsenic content (TAs and iAs) in brown rice than in white rice, with
differences close to 50%. Removing the bran layer during polishing
process is thus useful to reduce iAs in rice grain.

<p style=text-align:justify>The parboiling process, conversely, increases the As content of the
polished rice grain with respect to the not parboiled white rice. The
hydration and thermal phases of the parboiled process mobilize the high
content of arsenic present in the bran layer, so that TAs and iAs
contents in parboiled rice bran were 3-times lower than those in the
bran of not parboiled rice. The As removed from the bran was though
partly transferred into the endosperm, as evidenced by LA-ICP-MS, rising
the overall As content of the parboiled grain.

<p style=text-align:justify>In the rice grains subjected to different industrial processes, from
polishing to parboiling, the main form of As remains As(III) as iAs and
DMA(V) as organic Arsenic (oAs).

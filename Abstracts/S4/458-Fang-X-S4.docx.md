<p style=text-align:justify>Rice is the staple crop in southern China as well as for more than half
of the world population. In southern China, rice safety is threatened by
elevated concentrations of toxic metal(loid)s accumulating in rice
grain. Mining related industries in this ore-rich region extensively
dispersed metal(loid)s to streams and rivers which were used for
irrigation of rice paddies leading to soil contamination. Among toxic
metal(loid)s accumulated in paddy soils, cadmium (Cd) is of particular
concern due to its high mobility and soil-to-rice grain transfer factor
in acidic soils, which are typical in southern China, as well as its
long biological half-life in humans (&gt;10 years) after ingestion.

<p style=text-align:justify>The objective of this study was to reveal if rice grain Cd can be
related to soil physico-chemical characteristics at a relatively large
regional scale, which may be used to predict rice grain Cd based on an
empirical model. A previous study by Simmons and co-workers demonstrated
CaCl<sub>2</sub> extractable Cd using field-moist soil instead of conventionally
air-dried soil during grain-filling allowed reliable prediction of rice
grain Cd for 20 fields along a 3 km length of the Mae Tao Creek in
Thailand. However, it remains unclear whether similar moist soil
extraction can serve as a general test method to predict rice Cd for
paddy soils having strongly varying soil physico-chemical
characteristics.
<p style=text-align:justify>For this, we collected 35 paired soil-rice grain samples across five
provinces in southern China at the time when rice was ready to be
harvested during October to November 2017. Soil extraction with 0.01 M
CaCl<sub>2</sub> was conducted on site with field-moist soil immediately during
sampling to avoid changes in Cd speciation. For comparison, soil
extractions were also performed post-sampling in the laboratory using
air-dried soils. Element concentrations as analyzed in field-moist soil
extracts and in rice grains together with total soil analyses were used
as input variables in an explorative algorithm implemented in the R
software to generate best multi-variable regression models for rice Cd.
We found that rice Cd correlated more strongly to extractable Cd from
field-moist soils (R<sup>2</sup>=0.54) when compared to extractable Cd using
air-dried soils (R<sup>2</sup>=0.27). This may be due to oxidation of Cd sulfides
during drying, leading to a co-mobilization of Cd and S. Our data
analysis indicated that field-moist soil extractable Cd and Fe formed
    the best two-variable model for rice Cd (R<sub>rob</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.64) with
extractable Cd contributing 89% to the model-explained variance in rice
Cd. Our study demonstrated that 0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> extraction at rice
harvest using field-moist soil was able to predict rice Cd at a
relatively large regional scale with ranged soil physico-chemical
properties. Based on the findings presented in this study, bioavailable
Cd accumulating in the rice grain may reliably and quickly be tested by
0.01 M CaCl<sub>2</sub> extraction.

<p style=text-align:justify>Rice (Oryza sativa L.) consumption is a major route of dietary exposure
to arsenic (As). One main reason for the high accumulation of As in rice
grain is the high bioavailability of As in porewater of flooded paddy
soil. Recently, it has been shown that the application of soil microbial
fuel cell (sMFC) can significantly reduce soil porewater As
concentration, however, the effect of sMFC on As accumulation in rice is
unknown. In this study, a pot experiment was performed to investigate As
distribution in rice tissues and the functional microbial communities in
soil when the sMFC was installed. The results suggest that the sMFC can
simultaneously work as an electricity generator and As mitigator. The
total As concentrations in the stems, leaves, husks, and rice grains
were significantly decreased by 53.4%, 44.7%, 62.6%, and 67.9%,
respectively in the plants with sMFC compared to the control. This
decrease in As accumulation in the sMFC treatment may be explained by
the decrease in the As reducing arrC gene abundance and soil porewater
dissolve organic matter content. The sMFC also significantly increased
the relative abundance of the As oxidizing aioA and the As methylation
arsM genes which also may have favored the decrease in porewater As.
Therefore, the sMFC offers a promising way to mitigate As accumulation
in rice tissue and reduce dietary As exposure, while simultaneously
producing electricity.

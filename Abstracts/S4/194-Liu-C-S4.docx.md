<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) is toxic to plant cells even at low concentrations. Root is
the first barrier of Cd uptake in plant. Roots secrete an enormous range
of compounds into the surrounding soil to adapt various environments
(i.e., heavy metal stress). Rice tends to accumulate high quantity of
Cd, and is the major source of dietary Cd intake in rice-eating
populations. However, the impacts of root exudates on Cd uptake and
transport in rice have largely been overlooked. Here, we hypothesize
that metabolic up-regulation of the key root exudates to
sequester/exclude Cd would inhibit Cd uptake in Cd-tolerant rice by
forming Cd-complex. To test this hypothesis, two rice cultivars with
contrasting Cd tolerance and accumulation were selected to conduct root
exudations collection and metabolic profiling analysis by hydroponic
culture under 25 Î¼M Cd stress.

<p style=text-align:justify>The results showed that Cd inhibited the growth of the sensitive
cultivar while the tolerant one was promoted compared with the control
because of the lower Cd uptake, translocation and oxidative damage.
Under Cd stress, the tolerant cultivar tended to develop more
adventitious roots, and have greater root length, surface area, root
volume and number of tips while those root parameters of the sensitive
one were reduced, compared to the control. Cadmium addition inhibited
the uptake of trace elements (Cu, Mn, Mg and Fe), the concentration of
which had a significant negative correlation with shoot Cd
concentration. Metabolomics data revealed that Cd triggered significant
metabolic changes in root exudates which are significantly different
between the two rice cultivars, and three compounds were identified and
assumed to be potential biomarkers. The root exudate metabolic changes
revealed an active defence mechanism against Cd stress. Together, this
work demonstrates that root exudates metabolomics is a good tool to
reveal the detoxification mechanism of Cd tolerance in rice.

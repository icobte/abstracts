<p style=text-align:justify>Rice is the staple food for half of the global population. Cd
contamination in rice grains poses a potential health risk. The typical
pre-harvest drainage of paddy fields, coinciding with the rice grain
filling stage, can result in substantial mobilization of Cd in
contaminated soils, thereby causing elevated concentrations of Cd in the
rice grain. However, the processes controlling the mobilization of Cd
during soil drainage remains unknown. Using microcosm incubations with
twelve field-contaminated paddy soils varying widely with soil
properties, we investigated the factors controlling temporal changes in
Cd solubility in paddy soils. Generally, soluble and extractable Cd
concentrations decreased rapidly upon flooding but increased again
during the oxidation phase, with Cd solubility (aqueous Cd/soil Cd)
largely depending upon porewater pH. The decrease in both soluble Cd and
extractable Cd during the reducing phase did not appear to be related to
the major sulfate reduction. Furthermore, inhibiting sulfate reduction
using an inhibitor of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the reduction phase
or inhibiting oxidation dissolution of Cd-sulfides through gamma
irradiation during the oxidation phase had no or little effect on the
mobilization of Cd in the subsequent oxidation phase. Sequential
extraction revealed that changes in Cd availability were largely
dependent upon the transformation of Cd between the Fe-Mn
(oxyhydro)oxide fraction and exchangeable fraction during both soil
flooding and the oxidation phases. A concomitant decrease in soil pH
upon drainage of acid soils resulted in desorption of Cd from Fe-Mn
(oxyhydr)oxides, with this being responsible for the elevated
mobilization of Cd upon soil drainage. Taken together, our results
indicate that Fe-Mn (oxyhydr)oxides, rather than oxidation of sulfides,
play a critical (and prevalent) role in controlling the mobilization of
Cd upon soil drainage in paddy systems.

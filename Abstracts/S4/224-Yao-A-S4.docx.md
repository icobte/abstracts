<p style=text-align:justify>Safe production on large areas of cadmium (Cd)-contaminated paddy soil in China
is an important issue for peopleâ€™s health and sustainability of
agriculture. Cost saving and high efficient remediation strategies for
controlling rice Cd content are urgently needed. The effects of three
water management modes i.e. drought (D), intermittent flooding (IF),
continuous flooding (CF) and the combined application of water
management and amendments iron silicon rich materials (IS) and biochar
(B) on Cd uptake of different rice varieties were studied by field
experiment, and the possible mechanisms of their effects were discussed.
The results showed that the content of brown rice Cd under CF condition
from tillering to maturity stage was reduced by 0.2%-45.43% and by
37.67-62.11%, respectively, compared with IF and D treatments. Under
three water management modes, the content of brown rice Cd of low
accumulative rice cultivar G82168 was 35.03%-54.61% lower than that of
conventional variety. Under the condition of three modes of water (D.IF,
CF) management, the content of Cd in brown rice treated with IS
amendment decreased by 64.26%, 55.74% and 38.14% compared with that
treated with water management only, and the effect of combined amendment
IS+B was much weaker. Brown rice Cd was the lowest with the combined
application of low cumulative variety, continuous flooding and IS.
Continuous flooding could promote the fixation of Cd by root iron plaque
which acted as a barrier for Cd entering rice plant. On the other hand,
continuous flooding also significantly decreased soil available Cd
(extracted by 0.01M CaCl<sub>2</sub>) by 29.71%-63.13%. Both the mechanisms
helped to reduce the Cd uptake by rice. IS had no significant effect on
the root iron plaque fixed Cd. It decreased rice Cd uptake mainly by
decreasing the content of soil available Cd dramatically. The combined
application of low accumulative rice variety, continuous flooding and IS
can guarantee the safety of rice production on Cd contaminated paddy
soil. Planting low accumulative rice cultivars coupled with continuous
flooding during the critical growth stage are of great significance to
inhibit Cd uptake by rice. Application of amendments and low
accumulative rice varieties should be emphasized in water shortage
seasons or areas.

<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) contamination is a global problem. Rice is efficient in
accumulating As in grains, thus rice consumption has become the main
route of dietary As intake for populations consuming rice as the staple
food. Organic substances are recommended to be added to the soil for
carbon sequestration and soil fertility. However, organic substances
application has been demonstrated to remarkably influence As mobility
and transformation in soil.

<p style=text-align:justify>Straw incorporation is widely performed in As contaminated paddy fields.
Our results showed that rice straw application significantly increased
the abundance of iron-reducing bacterium, and the significant positive
correlation between dissolved As with Fe and the abundance of
iron-reducing bacterium suggested the coupling of As and Fe reduction
mediated by iron-reducing bacterium. In addition, rice straw application
significantly increased the abundance of methanogenic bacteria, and the
significant positive correlation between DMA in rice grains and the
abundance of methanogenic bacteria indicated that methanogenic bacteria
could be involved in As methylation after straw application. From this
study, it is clealy demonstrated that rice straw application
significantly enhanced As release from iron minerals and promoted As(V)
reduction to As(III) in soil, accelerated As methylation, enhanced As volatilization and elevated DMA
accumulation in polished grains, but decreased As(III) accumulation.

<p style=text-align:justify>Rice straw can be degraded to humic substances (HS) by microorganisms in
the soil. Humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) are dominating humic
substances (HS) in soil. We found that fulvic acid addition caused
significant enrichment of <i>Desulfitobacterium</i> (41-fold), and
significantly increased the concentrations of As (12-fold), iron (Fe;
20-fold), manganese (Mn; 3-fold) and acetic acid (3-fold) in soil
porewater. In contrast, HA slightly increased the concentrations of As
(1.2-fold) in porewater, and little effect on Fe, Mn and acetic acid.
Under both FA and HA treatments, As was primarily complexed with HS,
only a small fraction of free As was available for methylation.
Therefore, although there was abundant putative As methylating
microorganisms, such as <i>Methanobacterium</i> and <i>Methanosarcinaceae</i>, As
methylation was limited.

<p style=text-align:justify>These results illustrated that different organic substances exhibited
different effects of on As mobility and transformation in paddy soil
through regulating soil microbial community. These studies would advance our understanding of the
associations among As, Fe and organic substances through microorganisms
in paddy soil.

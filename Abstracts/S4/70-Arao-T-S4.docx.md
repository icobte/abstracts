<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) is a metalloid widely found as various organic and
inorganic forms in water, soil, and air. Organic and inorganic As are
also present in most foodstuffs. Contribution of each food category to
daily total (both inorganic and organic) As intake of the Japanese was
estimated. Fish and shellfish contributed the greatest to total daily
intake, followed by seaweed and rice.

<p style=text-align:justify>As compound present in fish and shellfish is mostly arsenobetaine and in
seaweed is mostly arsenosugar; both are organic As and considered
virtually nontoxic. Meanwhile, inorganic As [arsenate and arsenite] is
more toxic than organic As. Two food items— rice and hijiki seaweed, a
brown alga <i>Sargassum fusiforme</i>,—were estimated as major contributors
to daily inorganic As intake in the Japanese population. Because rice is
a globally important food crop, the Codex Alimentarius Commission set
the maximum levels for inorganic As in white rice in 2014 (0.2 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>) and brown rice in 2016 (0.35 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>).

<p style=text-align:justify>According to a survey of rice As concentrations by the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, approximately 5 % of brown
rice cultivated in Japan collected in 2012 contained inorganic As at the
concentration higher than 0.35 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, and the average concentration
(n = 600) of inorganic As was 0.21 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> for brown rice. It was
higher than that in brown rice collected from 2004 to 2006 (n=600) by
0.15 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>, so we examined the cause of the difference.

<p style=text-align:justify>For twenty years (1996-2015), rice plants had been cultivated in a paddy
field at our institute under flooding condition before and after
heading. The field experiments show positive correlation between
temperature after rice heading stage and inorganic As concentration in
rice grain. Global warming will increase temperature in rice growing
areas, which could result in higher concentration of inorganic As in
rice grain.

<p style=text-align:justify>To verify the effect of high temperature on As concentration in rice
grain, we conducted a pot experiment in temperature gradient chambers
(TGC). A chamber was divided into zones of three different temperature
(TGC1, TGC2, TGC3). Twenty seedlings per pot were
circular-dense-transplanted, and transferred into each TGC one week
after heading time and harvested at maturity. Average air temperature
from one week after heading to harvest time were 27.0 °C (TGC1), 28.3 °C
(TGC2) and 29.3 °C (TGC3). Rice inorganic As concentration were ranked
as TGC3 &gt; TGC2 &gt; TGC1. There was a significant negative
correlation between inorganic As concentration and thousand‐kernel
weight.

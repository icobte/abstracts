<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium isn’t the essential element for rice. However, it can enter rice
by magnesium or manganese transporter, and accumulates in grains later,
which would seriously affect food safety. Diseases caused by Cd include
chronic kidney toxicity, ‘itai-itai disease’, cancer and other health
problems. As a way to reduce the effective Cd in soil, people implement
paddy field water management. However, this way increased the
effectiveness of As in the soil. Developing low Cd-accumulation rice
cultivars seems to be a better plan. To further research into the key
genes of Cd accumulation, we adopted 243 RILs from the Cd-tolerant
cultivar TNG67 and the Cd-sensitive cultivar TN1 as material. RADseq was
conducted to make a linkage map of the 243 RILs. By comparing the
linkage map with the phenotype under Cd stress, we selected 3 potential
QTLs, HMA3, CdT1 and CdT2, which are related to Cd-accumulation. In the
future, we would confirm the function of the potential QTLs by gene
deletion or gene editing. As more Cd-accumulation genes are revealed,
it’s possible to make low Cd-accumulation cultivars by QTL pyramiding or
gene editing.

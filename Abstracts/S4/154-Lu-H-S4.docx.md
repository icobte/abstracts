<p style=text-align:justify>It has been shown that bacterial communities in the rhizosphere of crops
have profound influence on plant performance including productivity,
pathogen resistance, and nutrient and heavy metal uptake. Due to cadmium
(Cd) contamination in agricultural lands, understanding the mechanisms
underlying the dynamics of bacterial communities under Cd stress is
essential to achieve sustainable agroecosystems. However, the
composition of soil bacterial communities co-shaped by plant species and soil
properties including Cd concentration is still obscure. The high
complexity of the communities is a challenge for studying the mechanisms
of community dynamics. The present study is to identify representative
and culturable bacterial communities associated with rice roots under Cd
stress using the newly developed gnotobiotic system. Bacterial
assemblages in paddy soil will be collected and the culturable members
will be obtained through host-mediated selection under Cd stress
simulating the actual Cd concentration in paddy fields. It is expected
that the obtained simplified, culturable and repeatable bacterial
community shall facilitate future studies on the detailed experiments to
define the mechanisms underlying the dynamics of community assemblages
and the beneficial effects of such microbiomes on rice.

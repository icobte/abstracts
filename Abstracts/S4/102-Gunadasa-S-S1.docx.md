<p style=text-align:justify>Overuse of agrochemicals, combined with a suite of little controlled
industrial activities, have resulted in metal(loid) contamination of
agricultural soils in many parts of the world with often serious impacts
on human health and the environment. The Dry Zone of Sri Lanka has one
of the world’s highest incidents of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with
more than 30,000 reported related deaths. Exposure to cadmium (Cd) and
arsenic (As) sourced from the agrochemicals used in rice farming has
been proposed as one of the possible causes. The aims of this study
were, to examine As and Cd in the soils and rice seeds of dry zone Sri
Lanka and to understand factors influencing contaminant sorption and
risk. Surface soil samples (0–15 cm) were collected using grid
systematic sampling for two consecutive years (2017 and 2018) from four
different locations including three CKD hotspots <i>Giradurukotte</i> (G),
<i>Madawachchiya</i> (M) and <i>Padaviya</i> (P) and a non-affected area
<i>Hambanthota</i> (H) in the Dry Zone, Sri Lanka. Soils for each sampling
location were characterised and analysed for total Cd and As as well as
other trace elements. Rice seeds from the four (4) locations were also
analysed. Subsequently, a series of sorption experiments using two
soils, sandy loam (pH = 7.25) (A) and sandy clay loam (pH = 4.95) (B)
with similar characteristics to dry zone soil in Sri Lanka were used to
understand factors influencing the concentrations and mobilisation of
the two contaminants in the Sri Lankan soils. All data was analysed with
R version 3.5.0. For the field soils in 2017, the mean As and Cd
concentrations were 0.99 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (0.00-3.50 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and 0.63 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup> (0.00-7.32 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), respectively. There were a significant
differences in Cd (H = 94.13, df = 3, p&lt;0.001) and As concentrations
(H = 33.03, df = 3, p&lt;0.001) between sampling locations. In 2018
results showed significantly (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05) elevated soil As (1.58 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup> (0.00-3.85 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>)) and Cd (2.19 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (1.20-11.21 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>)) at all locations compared to 2017. Nevertheless, the As and Cd
concentrations detected in all samples collected in dry zone paddy soils
were less than sensitive land use health investigation levels (HIL) in
Australia (As-100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and Cd-20 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). The As/Cd
concentrations of rice samples were all ≤ 0.1mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, and less than
food standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) guideline values for Cd
(0.1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and As (1 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in rice. The sorption of As and Cd
on Soil A and B were best-fit with the Freundlich model. The sorption
experiments revealed that soil pH had an important influence on As and
Cd Kd values, with significantly lower As sorption in soil A, and lower
Cd sorption in the more acidic Soil B. Synergistic and antagonistic
effects on sorption of the co-occurring contaminants were evident. This
represents the first systematic study of As and Cd in some of the CKD
affected areas in Sri Lanka. The paddy soils sampled were indeed
slightly contaminated but not to concentrations that would be expected
to result in significant risk. The sorption experiments showed that the
contaminant concentrations in the soils were directly affected by the
soil and the co-contaminant. To fully understand the risk presented by
As and Cd in the affected environment, and the factors that may be
influencing concentrations in soils and the wider environment additional
work should target.

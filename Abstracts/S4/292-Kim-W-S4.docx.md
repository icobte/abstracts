<p style=text-align:justify>Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) is one of the most widely consumed staple
cereal foods in the world constituting about 89% of the diet of people
in Asian countries. In many East and South Asian countries, the
accumulation of arsenic (As) in rice ecosystems and its subsequent
transfer to the human food chain is a major environmental issue. Codex
Committee of Contaminants in Food (CCCF) has set a new standard of
arsenic (As) in rice in 2014 and discussing a code of practice for the
prevention and reduction of As contamination in rice since 2013. In
order to establish a propose draft maximum level for As in rice,
inorganic and total As content in both brown and polished rice produced
were monitored in Korea. The average concentration of inorganic and
total As in polished rice monitored were 0.07 and 0.11 mg/kg,
respectively. The average concentration of inorganic and total As in
brown rice monitored were 0.11 and 0.18 mg/kg, respectively. In this
study, the As in rice was not closely related to the As in paddy soil
taken from the same sites. This study were also conducted to investigate
the effect of water management and soil amendments on As accumulation in
rice, and to select the low As accumulation rice genotypes which are
resistant to As uptake. The reduction efficiency of the amendment was
confirmed to be higher efficiency in As reduction for brown rice by the
order of gypsum &gt; steel slag &gt; poultry manure &gt; agri-lime. We
also concluded that limited water supply may be a promising strategy to
reduce As accumulation in rice grains. 280 rice cultivars were screened
to find the lower As accumulated rice cultivars in Korea. It concluded
that the screening program is feasible to effectively reduce the risk of
human exposure. However, additional field studies and As
bioaccessibility research are required to control As in paddy soils and
rice grains.

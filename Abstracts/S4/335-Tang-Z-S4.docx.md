<p style=text-align:justify>Rice is a major dietary source of inorganic arsenic, a non-threshold
carcinogen. Reducing arsenic accumulation in rice grain is of critical
importance for food safety. In our work, we investigated the role of a
member of the rice C-type ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter
(OsABCC) family, OsABCC7, in arsenite [As(III)] accumulation in rice.
Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that <i>OsABCC7</i> was expressed
intensively in the roots and the expression was strongly suppressed by
As(III) exposure. Transgenic rice plants expressing <i>OsABCC7</i> Pro-GUS
showed that the gene was predominantly expressed in the xylem parenchyma
cells in the stele region of the primary and lateral roots.
Transient expression of
OsABCC7:GFP fusion protein in <i>Nicotiana benthamiana</i> leaf cells showed
that the protein was localized at the plasma membrane. When expressed in
<i>Xenopus laevis</i> oocytes, OsABCC7 showed an efflux activity for
As(III)-glutathione complex but not for As(III). Knockout of <i>OsABCC7</i>
in rice significantly decreased As(III) concentration in the xylem sap
and As concentration in the shoots, but had little effect on root As
concentration. Taken together, our results indicate that <i>OsABCC7</i> is
involved in the root-to-shoot translocation of As(III).

<p style=text-align:justify>Microbial sulfate and iron reductions have the potential for the
remediation of soils contaminated by cadmium (Cd), but the effectiveness
may be limited by the availability of organic matter (OM) because most
iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria are heterotrophic. In addition, Cd
mobility has hardly been investigated in soils with a realistic
concentration of total Cd. We successfully accounted for the dynamics of
Cd solubility in a paddy soil that contained 0.36 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> total Cd
after flooding and re-drying by monitoring multiple soil chemical and
microbial properties. After flooding, the addition of rice straw
promoted greater microbial iron reduction and greater increase in soil
pH compared to the control and treatments with added gypsum or hematite.
Consequently, dissolved soil Cd decreased from 34 μg kg<sup>-1</sup> to under the
detection limit in a week when straw was added but remained high even
after eight weeks in the control (13 μg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and treatments with
added hematite (8 μg kg<sup>-1</sup>) or gypsum (12 μg kg<sup>-1</sup>). After re-drying,
dissolved Cd in the straw-amended soil increased but was still lower
than other three treatments after five weeks. The results suggest OM
addition is efficient to immobilize soil Cd at a realistically low
concentration by stimulating microbial reductions of soil native
oxidized components after flooding, while adding extra iron oxide or
sulfate alone is not effective because it cannot remove the limitation
by OM availability.

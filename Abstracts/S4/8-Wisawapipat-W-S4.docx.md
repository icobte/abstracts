<p style=text-align:justify>Mitigation of arsenic (As) accumulation in rice is imperative to pursue
globally to decrease human threat from As-laden rice consumption.
Intermittent flooding constitutes a successful measure in reducing
As-grain level; however, it is an uncommon practice for rice production
in Asia as compared to continuous flooding and can limit rice yield.
Arsenite (As<sup>III</sup>)â€“natural organic matter (NOM) complexes under strong
reducing conditions have been documented as an effective mechanism for
As sequestration in terrestrial wetlands, yet the contribution of NOM on
As bioavailability in the soil-plant system remains unresolved. Herein,
we examined the effects of organic sulfur (manure) and inorganic sulfur
(sulfur powder) on As bioavailability in an As-laden soil and rice grown
under continuously flooded conditions. Soil incorporation of organic and
inorganic sulfur materials significantly (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05) decreased As<sup>III</sup>
concentration in grain by 65% and 61%, respectively. The As solubility
data revealed that As associated with sulfides and resistant minerals
were the dominant As pools in the sulfur-amended soil, demonstrating the
formation of As sulfides using reductive precipitation. Our results
shade light on the potential use of sulfur materials in decreasing grain
As concentration under continuous anaerobic conditions. Moreover, such
flooded conditions efficiently promote the metal sulfide precipitates,
which advocate the proper water management regimes for reducing grain Cd
level in contaminated soils. The combined use of sulfur material with
continuous flooding management is proposed to be a promising practice to
diminish both As and Cd levels in rice grown in As/Cd co-contaminated
soils.

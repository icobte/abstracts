<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) in the rice paddy soil are a serious
public concern for people whose diet is chiefly based on rice. For rice
cultivation in some temperate and (sub)tropical areas, paddy soil
undergoes a long flooding (reducing) period followed by a short draining
(oxidizing) period, which can alter solubility of Cd in the soil. In
contrast to Cd, soil As chemistry is contrastingly different and the
solubility increases more in the reducing conditions where As occurs
mainly as As(III). Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure
(XAFS) spectroscopy was used to understand chemical species of Cd and As
in relation to their solubility and redox gradients in paddy soils.

<p style=text-align:justify>Our study found that the formation and dissolution of CdS is primarily
controlled by redox potential and sulfur (S) in the soil. In the
reducing period, the CdS proportion in the high-S soil was rapidly
increased to 30% at day 4 and reached 90% at day 29, whereas CdS in the
low-S soil did not exceed 35%. In the following oxidizing period, CdS in
the soils underwent oxidative dissolution, but was not completely
dissolved remaining at &lt; 20% to the total Cd. Our study also found
that S impurity in zero-valent iron (ZVI) particles enhances the
formation of CdS in reduced soils. Cadmium K-edge µ-XAFS spectra for
selected soil particles revealed that the proportion of CdS ranged from
20 to 87% (ave. 53 ± 22%) in the soil with low-S ZVI and from 64 to 98%
(ave. 84 ± 14%) in the soil with high-S ZVI.

<p style=text-align:justify>An excess of sulfate decreased extractable and dissolved As in the soil
reducing period due to retardation of soil reduction process that
decreased soluble As(III) in the soil solid phase. The As species at the
end of soil reducing period were 38-41% As(V), 46-51% As(III), and
11-13% As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>-like species, regardless of initial S treatments. In
the following soil reoxidation, As<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub>-like species were sensitive to
oxidation and disappeared completely in the first 2 days when the Eh
value increased rapidly above 160 mV. About 50% of As(III) to the total
As persisted over 32 days of soil reoxidation period (Eh &gt; 400mV),
suggesting some mechanisms against oxidation of As(III) such as physical
sequestration in soil microsites. Arsenic species and distribution in Fe
plaque of the rice rhizosphere soil were investigated using micro-XANES
spectroscopy. The result demonstrated that oxidation of As(III) to As(V)
occurred faster in the Fe-plaque than the soil matrix, and As was
sequestered in iron mottles originating from Fe-plaque around the roots.
The ratio of As(V) to As(III) decreased toward the outer-rim of the
subsurface Fe mottles where lepidocrocite occurred preferentially. These
results provide direct evidence that speciation of As in proximity to
roots depends on spatial and temporal redox variations in the soil
matrix.

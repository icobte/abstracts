<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic redox transformation and methylation are long-recognized to
control its chemical speciation, thus bioavailability to rice plants.
    Arsenic thiolation, the formation of soluble inorganic thioarsenates (As<sup>V</sup>S<sup>-II</sup><sub>n</sub>O<sub>4-n</sub><sup>3-</sup>, with n=1-4) and
    methylated thioarsenates ((As<sup>V</sup>S<sup>-II</sup><sub>n</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)O<sub>3-n</sub><sup>3-</sup> or
    As<sup>V</sup>S<sup>-II</sup><sub>n</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2-n</sub><sup>3-</sup> with n=1-3) under sulfate-reducing
conditions, has to date seldom been considered in soil environments.
Inorganic thioarsenates are structural analogues to arsenate and formed
from arsenite, zerovalent sulfur, and sulfide. How methylated
thioarsenates form in nature has not been investigated, yet, but in
synthetic solutions they are formed from the reaction between methylated
arsenates and microbially produced sulfide.


<p style=text-align:justify>Studies of 31 distinct paddy fields across China using standardized soil
anaerobic incubations revealed widespread occurrence of arsenic
thiolation over various environmental gradients. The magnitude of
arsenic thiolation was comparable to methylation, with thioarsenates
contributing in sum up to 29% to total arsenic. Sulfate addition
generally increased total arsenic thiolation, but with only minor
impacts on its large scale distribution. The geographic pattern of total
arsenic thiolation was intrinsically determined by variations in soil
parameters, and was largely correlated with total zerovalent sulfur
formed anaerobically. The speciation of thioarsenates was strongly
driven by soil pH values. Methylated thioarsenates dominated in acidic
paddy soils, whereas inorganic thioarsenates dominated in neutral and
alkaline paddy soils. Both inorganic and methylated thioarsenates were
found to be partially decomposed after soil drainage, but all species
were also discovered after re-flooding. Further soil oxidation
experiments proved that thioarsenates oxidized the fastest the more
thio-groups they had. Dimethylmonothioarsenate showed the highest
stability upon prolonged oxidation. Given the ubiquitous occurrence of
arsenic and sulfur, we suggest that thioarsenate formation as well as
their environmental fate need to be deciphered in future paddy soil
arsenic studies.

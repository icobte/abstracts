<p style=text-align:justify>Rice is a staple food for half population of the world, but also a major
dietary source of cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As). Therefore, there is an
urgent requirement to reduce both Cd and As in rice grain for human
health. By using different approaches, many transporters involved in the
transport of Cd and As from soil to the grain have been identified in
rice. Recently, attempts have been made to reduce As and Cd accumulation
through manipulation of relevant transporters. For example, knockout of
OsNramp5, a major transporter for Cd uptake has resulted in significant
reduction of Cd in rice grain although the effect on yield was not
consistent between different studies. Several studies consistently
showed that over-expression of OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized transporter
for vacuolar Cd sequestration resulted in decreased Cd accumulation in
rice grain without yield penalty. On the other hand, knockout of Lsi1
and Lsi2, two transporters for arsenite and Si in rice, decreased
accumulation of As, but also showed negative effect on the yield because
Si uptake was also hampered. Recently, over-expression of OsABCC1, a
node-based transporter for As distribution, under control of specific
promoter, resulted in effective reduction of As in rice grain. Recent
progress on molecular breeding of low-Cd rice by using low-Cd alleles
will also be presented at the symposium.

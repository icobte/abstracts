<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) is a toxic carcinogen so it is crucial to decrease As
accumulation in crops to reduce its risk to human health. The
transporters for As uptake and metabolism have been elucidated and
target genes have been identified in different plants, which may offer
effective approaches to reduce As accumulation in plants, especially in
some important crops.

<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenite (AsIII) antiporter ACR3 is critical for As metabolism in
organisms, but it is lost in flowering plants. Here, a novel ACR3 gene
from As hyperaccumulator <i>Pteris vittata</i>, PvACR3;1, was cloned and
expressed in <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i> (yeast), <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>
(model plant), and <i>Nicotiana tabacum</i> (tobacco). Yeast experiments
showed that PvACR3;1 functioned as an AsIII-antiporter to mediate AsIII
efflux to an external medium. At 5 μM AsIII, PvACR3;1 transgenic
<i>Arabidopsis</i> accumulated 14−29% higher As in the roots and 55−61% lower
As in the shoots compared to WT control, showing lower As translocation.
Besides, transgenic tobacco under 5 μM AsIII or AsV also showed similar
results, indicating that expressing PvACR3;1 increased As retention in
plant roots. Moreover, observation of PvACR3;1−green fluorescent protein
fusions in transgenic Arabidopsis showed that PvACR3;1 localized to the
vacuolar membrane, indicating that PvACR3;1 mediated AsIII sequestration
into vacuoles, consistent with increased root As. In addition, soil
experiments showed ~22% lower As in the shoots of transgenic tobacco
than control.

<p style=text-align:justify>Based on the above results, we also transformed <i>PvACR3;1</i> gene into
rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.), which is the staple food for half of the
world’s population and also an efficient accumulator of As. Similar to
<i>Arabidopsis</i> and tobacco, transgenic rice also showed higher As
retention in plant roots and lower As translocation to the aboveground
tissues. More importantly, When grown in flooded soils with As,
expressing <i>PvACR3;1</i> significantly reduced inorganic As accumulation in
brown rice by &gt;20%, significant for controlling As exposure risk from
rice. Thus, our study provides a potential strategy to limit As
accumulation in rice, shedding light on engineering low-As crops to
improve food safety.

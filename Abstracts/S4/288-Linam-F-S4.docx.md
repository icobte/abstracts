<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic and cadmium are contaminants of concern in many rice-growing
regions, such as Southeast Asia. Arsenic is a concern due to the geology
and the increased mobility and toxicity of As under reduced/flooded soil
conditions. Methylated As species (MMA, DMA, TMAO, e.g.) are formed by
microbes in flooded rice paddies and can accumulate in rice grain.
Arsenic can limit rice yield through straighthead disorder and is also
toxic to humans. Minimizing flooding can lower As mobility, but
increases Cd mobility in acidic soils and decreases yield. Strategies
that minimize both As and Cd uptake while minimizing yield loss are
critically needed. The benefits of Si to rice are well known, and these
include yield increases and resistance to environmental stressors.
Recent research suggests that increasing Si may limit uptake of As via
competition of silicic acid and arsenous acid for transporters, and Cd
via several mechanisms including increasing soil pH, growth dilution,
and retention in cell walls. Release of Si through soil mineral
dissolution is slow, and plant available Si is dominated by biogenic
sources such as plant residues that are Si-rich such as rice husks. We
posit that biochar of rice husk can be optimized for maximum retention
of organic As forms as well as Cd<sup>2+</sup>.

<p style=text-align:justify>The properties of biochar are altered by production parameters such as
feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature. Therefore, we investigated the
physicochemical changes of rice husk biochar created at various
pyrolysis temperatures to determine the biochar for maximum sorption of
Cd and organic As species. A key factor was the decrease in biochar
surface functional groups seen at high pyrolysis temperatures. Pyrolysis
of rice crop residues can transform many of the minerals present,
including Si. Thus, we also investigated the effect of biochar
production parameters on Si availability. Total Si supply and rate of Si
dissolution were evaluated, showing maximum release rate at low
pyrolysis temperatures. Through correlation of these results, optimal
pyrolysis conditions were identified to maximize both contaminant
sorption and Si release to soil by rice husk biochar. Next, we performed
sorption and desorption isotherms of organic As species MMA and DMA and
Cd<sup>2+</sup> onto biochars created at different temperatures. We also examined
the effects of different biochar additions on methylated As species
production in paddy soil, to test if amendment addition provided
substrates for methylation. These data provide insight into methylation
dynamics in rice paddy soil, and the potential for, and nature of,
organometallic sorption by biochar. These optimized biochars can have
applications for rice paddies as well as in water treatment to minimize
human exposure to As and Cd.

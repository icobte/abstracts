<p style=text-align:justify>Staple crops such as rice are our major sources of cadmium (Cd).
Therefore, a fundamental understanding of processes that control Cd
accumulation in crops is crucial. Currently, we are investigating Cd
behaviour in rice by combining synchrotron solid state speciation
analysis with Cd isotope process tracing in contaminated soil-rice
systems. The main principle of the combined approach is that (i)
synchrotron solid state speciation techniques (XANES) identify snapshots
of Cd speciation in soil and rice compartments at the time of sampling
(ii) while mass balances and isotope ratios provide information on how
Cd speciation control the mobility of Cd during plant growth. With this
combined approach, we aim to provide a holistic view on major processes
that determine the Cd distribution in distinct soil-rice systems.

<p style=text-align:justify>To this end, we grew rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) in pots that contained wet
and flooded soils that were spiked with 15 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Cd. We grew two
rice accessions: Taichung and TCM213, which respectively have functional
and non-functional OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter. At
flowering stage, we collected bulk soil, roots, and shoots. During plant
growth, we frequently collected soil solution and analyzed pH, Eh, TOC,
major cations and anions, Fe, Zn, and Cd concentrations as well Cd
isotopes to model Cd speciation in soil solution using PHREEQC. Prior
isotope analysis using MC-ICPMS, soil and plant samples were purified
using a one stage anion exchange chromatography. For bulk XANES
analysis, samples were frozen with liquid nitrogen immediately after
their harvest.

<p style=text-align:justify>At the conference, we will show Cd mass balances, Cd isotope, and Cd
speciation data of flooded and non flooded soil-rice systems. Overall,
we expect that S ligands will strongly determine the mobility of Cd in
the entire soil-rice system. First soil solution data showed that the
different soil redox states caused contrasting soil properties that
control the solubility of Cd in the soil such as pH, Fe<sup>2+</sup>
concentrations, and total dissolved organic carbon. We expect that
dissolution of Fe-oxides and sulfide formation in the flooded soils will
alter Cd binding sites in the soil and thus also the Cd isotope ratios
in soil solution and plants. Within the rice, we expect that the
retention of Cd in the roots is not only determined by its functional
HMA3 transporter but also by a Cd immobilization through enhanced
binding to S ligands in vacuoles. Consequently, a larger fraction of Cd
bound to S should be accompanied by a strong enrichment of light
isotopes in roots in wild type compared to mutant rice. The outcomes of
this pot trial will be integrated into current conceptual models of Cd
isotope fractionation and Cd transport in soil-plant systems.

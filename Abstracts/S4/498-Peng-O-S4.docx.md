<p style=text-align:justify>Based on the current situation of cadmium(Cd)-arsenic(As) combined
pollution in paddy soils in southern China, this study investigates,
under hydroponic conditions, whether the application of different
silicon(Si) fertilizers addition methods(spraying to foliage(F<sub>Si</sub>),
solution culture addition(Si) and both(F<sub>Si</sub>+Si) )or different Si
content(20 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>(Si<sub>(20)</sub> )and 40 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>(Si<sub>(40)</sub>) can
simulaneously reduce Cd and As concentration in rice grain. Results
indicate that three addition methods of Si application can significantly
reduce the Cd and As concentration in rice grain, the effect of Si<sub>(40)</sub>
on Cd and As concentration in rice grain was more
applicable than Si<sub(20)</sub. Treatment of foliar spray(F<sub>Si</sub>) significantly
decreased Cd and inorganic As accumulation in brown rice compared to the
control(<i>p</i><0.05); Treatments of Si<sub>(20)</sub> and Si<sub>(40)</sub> can sharply
reduced Cd and inorganic As concentration in rice(50% or more) compared
to the control, but there was still risk of exceeding the standard limit
for Food Safe of People’s Republic of China(0.2 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup> Cd and inorganic As ); In addition, F<sub>Si</sub>+Si<sub(20)</sub> and
F<sub>Si</sub>+Si<sub>(40)</sub> have the best effect to decreased Cd and inorganic As
concentration in edible grains. The results of this investigation
demonstrated the potential effects of F<sub>Si</sub>+Si in reducing Cd and As
concentrations in rice grain.

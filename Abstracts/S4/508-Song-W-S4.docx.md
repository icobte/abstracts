<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) causes number of serious diseases. Rice is the major food
for arsenic (As) intake in human, since it efficiently accumulates As
much more than other cereal crops. Identification of genes and the
molecular mechanisms for As transport and detoxification is crucial step
to develop lower As rice. Hear we identified 25 rice genes participating
As resistance using yeast expression system with rice cDNA library
generated from mRNA of As-treated rice roots. Among of them, AsRT1 (a
zinc finger type transcription factor) exhibited the most dramatically
improved As resistance in yeast cells and inhibited As accumulation
through the regulation of many different mechanisms, such as As efflux,
As uptake and ubiquitination in yeast. The loss of functional mutants of
Arabidopsis and rice <i>AsRT1</i> and <i>AsRT2</i> expressing phloem in shoot less
accumulated As in seeds. The calli generated from a<i>tasrt1atasrt2</i>
exhibited enhanced As resistance and reduced As accumulation compared to
those of WT. The results from As feeding assay with rosette leaves and
stem of <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice showed that the <i>Arabidopsis</i> and rice
mutants had reduced As transport activity to neighbor tissues through
the phloem pathway. Our results suggest that rice and Arabidopsis AsRTs
are the transcription factors to regulate As translocation into seeds
through the phloem pathway.

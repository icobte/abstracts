<p style=text-align:justify>Phytoextraction is an attractive technique to remove cadmium (Cd) from
soils because it is cost-effective and environmental friendly. High-Cd
accumulating rice varieties (henceforce: high-Cd rice), especially, are
desirable to remove Cd from paddy soils. However, such varieties so far
are all indica-type and they are not suitable for the practical
cultivation in Japan because of high shattering and easy lodging habit,
resulting in unfit for mechanical harvesting. In this study, we
attempted to develop practical high Cd varieties with non-shattering and
lodging resistance that are suitable for the Japanese rice cultivation
systems.

Three practical high Cd rice varieties were developed:

<p style=text-align:justify>A variety name "Phytoremediation CD No.1" is characteristics of
non-shattering and lodging resistance with short culm. This variety was
produced by a gamma ray mutation method from an indica-type, a high-Cd
rice variety “Jarjan”.

<p style=text-align:justify>"Phytoremediation CD No. 2" is non-shattering and strong culm. This
variety was developed by crossing of “Jarjan” and “Tachisugata” which is
a rice variety for whole crop silage use. DNA markers were used to
introduce Jarjan OsHMA3 allele showing high-Cd accumulation and
Tachisugata qSH1 allele showing a non-shattering habit.

<p style=text-align:justify>"Phytoremediation CD No.3" is also non-shattering and lodging
resistance. In addition, this variety showed substantially high-Cd
accumulation ability via pyramiding of several genes of high-Cd traits.

<p style=text-align:justify>In four field trials, the amounts of Cd accumulation in aerial part of
"Phytoremediation CD No.1" was 3.6 to 16.7 times higher than those of
leading edible japonica rice varieties (control varieties).
"Phytoremediation CD No.2" accumulated Cd at 7.0 to 14.2 times higher
than the control varieties, and "Phytoremediation CD No.3" showed 7.7 to
12.1 times higher than the controls.

<p style=text-align:justify>We achieved producing three new varieties carrying necessary traits of
high-Cd accumulation, non-shattering, and lodging resistance. In
addition, we confirmed that these varieties have high practicability for
phytoextraction use in the Japanese paddy fields.

<p style=text-align:justify>We expect that use of these varieties for extracting Cd will be a good
method to reduce Cd concentrations in edible rice grains.

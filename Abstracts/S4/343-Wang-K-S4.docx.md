<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd)-contamination of agricultural soils has raised a worldwide
concern because of its high toxicity to plants; also it can be
transferred via the food chains and accumulate in human bodies,
resulting in many health problems such as itai-itai disease, liver
damage, lung edema, and so on. Meanwhile, the application of potassium
(K) fertilizers has a broad influence on the transportation and
accumulation of Cd in soil-crop system. Therefore, a greenhouse pot
experiment was conducted with in-situ Cd-contaminated soil to study the
influence of different forms of K fertilizers (KCl, K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and
KNO<sub>3</sub>) on Cd accumulation in rice, wheat, and pakchoi as well as Cd
fractions in soils. The results showed the Cd contents in all crops
increased in the KCl treatments; it increased by 10.84%-172.77%,
17.09%-67.72%, 15.27%-41.22% in rice grains, wheat grains, and pakchoi
shoots, respectively, when KCl dose increased from the lowest to the
highest. Generally, in the K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> treatment, the Cd contents in rice
decreased greatly while those in wheat and pakchoi increased slightly.
The supply of KNO<sub>3</sub> also led to an increase in the Cd contents in
crops. In addition, KCl resulted in a significant increase in the
NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub> extractable Cd (NEX-Cd) content in paddy soil. However, there
were no significant differences in NEX-Cd content between all the
treatments in wheat soil or pakchoi soil no matter which forms or doses
of K fertilizers were applied. Consequently, when K fertilizers are
applied to in-situ Cd-contaminated soils, both forms and doses should be
fully considered to mitigate the Cd accumulation in crops, especially
the edible part. Hopefully, our manuscript can offer opinions to
understand underlying mechanisms of Cd transportation in soil-crop
system when soil was disturbed by potassium fertilizers.

<p style=text-align:justify>Rice, a staple food for half of the world’s population, takes up
approximately 10 times more Arsenic (As) than other cereals and
contributes to human As exposure. Arsenic is ubiquitously present in
soils and mobilized during rice cultivation on flooded paddy soils by
reductive dissolution of iron minerals. Recently, methylated
    thioarsenates (HAsS<sub>x</sub>O<sub>4−(x+y)</sub>(CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>y</sub><sup>2−</sup>, x;y =1-2) and inorganic
    thioarsenates (HAsS<sub>x</sub>O<sub>4−x</sub><sup>2−</sup>, x =1-4) have been reported to occur in
paddy fields besides the better-known oxyarsenates. Inorganic
thioarsenates are structural analogues to arsenate and form under
sulfur-reducing conditions from arsenite via OH-/SH- ligand exchange and
addition of zerovalent sulfur. Methylated thioarsenates form via ligand
exchange of OH-/SH- in mono- (MMA) or dimethylarsenate (DMA) molecules.
Sulfur (S) addition is one driver for the occurrence of thiolation, even
though naturally occurring S concentrations are sufficient for As
thiolation in paddy soils. Sulfur fertilization has recently been
suggested to lower grain As concentration, however, no conclusive data
have been obtained so far.


<p style=text-align:justify>Even though methylated thioarsenates are highly toxic for humans, no
data about uptake, transformation or translocation of methylated
thioarsenates in plants are available until now. Using hydroponic
experiments with 20-day-old rice plants, we showed that
monomethylmonothioarsenate (MMMTA), dimethylmonothioarsenate (DMMTA),
and monothioarsenate (MTA) were taken up by rice roots and could be
detected in the xylem. Total arsenic translocation from roots to shoots
was higher for plants exposed to DMMTA, MTA, and DMA compared to MMMTA
and MMA. Our experiments revealed that all thioarsenates were partially
transformed in the presence of rice roots, but processes and extents
differed. MMMTA was subject to abiotic oxidation and largely dethiolated
to MMA outside the plant by root oxygen loss (ROL). DMMTA and MTA were
not oxidized by ROL. Inside roots, MTA was rapidly enzymatically reduced
to arsenite, while DMMTA transformation to DMA was not enzymatically
catalyzed and much slower.

<p style=text-align:justify>While MMMTA and MTA seem to be less critical for food safety, based on
current knowledge, DMMTA behaves differently as uptake and total As
translocation are high. Although DMMTA is mostly transformed to DMA, it
is the only As species besides arsenite, arsenate, MMA and DMA that has
ever been detected in rice grains before. DMMTA is highly toxic,
comparable to inorganic As, but co-determined as DMA using common acid
extraction for rice grains as the acid converts DMMTA to DMA. This is
especially problematic, as DMA is not considered toxic and exempt from
food guidelines. Contribution of DMMTA and total As in rice grains
especially after S fertilization needs to be further investigated and
potentially both standard extraction methods and guidelines need to be
adapted.

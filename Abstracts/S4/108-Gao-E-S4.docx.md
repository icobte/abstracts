<p style=text-align:justify>In addition to the determination of the total arsenic content, the
separation and analysis of the occurring species is now established in
the quality control of food. While beverages such as apple or orange
juice, wine, etc. can be analyzed directly after dilution, foods such as
fish or rice require more complex sample preparation. Here it must be
ensured that the arsenic species are not oxidized or converted into each
other.

<p style=text-align:justify>The study describes and compares different possibilities of sample
preparation and analysis with the aim of obtaining a simple and
practicable way for the industry from raw material to a samples ready
for analysis. With the help of the SpeedMill Plus and an additional
lysis, the samples are decomposed to a solution. Microwave extraction of
arsenic species is an alternative way of preparing e.g. rice or
chocolate for identification of arsenic species. Here the temperature
and oxidizing conditions are critical to maintain the species
composition. The study furthermore presents the optimization of the
HPLC-ICP-MS method to ensure short run times but obtain a clear
separation of all Arsenic species of interest.

<p style=text-align:justify>The subsequent analysis using HPLC-ICP-MS (PQLC and PlasmaQuantÂ® MS)
characterizes the samples and allows an evaluation of the entire
workflow according to criteria such as digestion quality, species
recovery, but also handling, throughput and applicability in routine
operation. First results show that the easy handling of the SpeedMill
Plus offers a simplified preparation process without compromising the
results.

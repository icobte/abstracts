<p style=text-align:justify>Paddy rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) is a staple crop in most East and
Southeast Asian countries. However, across Asia, cadmium (Cd) has
increasingly accumulated in paddy soil owing to the use of phosphate
fertilizers and the release of industrial effluents into irrigation
channels that are used for flooding paddy fields. The food safety risk
posed by increasing Cd levels in rice is of great concern. Information
about the genotypic variations of Cd tolerance, distribution, and
accumulation in rice plants is essential for selecting and breeding more
rice cultivars to reduce Cd in human diets. Rice cultivars showing low
Cd transportation into the aboveground parts of a plant can be selected
to reduce Cd contamination in grains. In this study, eight rice
cultivars, TY3, TK9, TNG71, KH145, TKW1, TKW3, TCS10, and TCS17, which
are commonly grown in Taiwan, were used. The seedlings of each cultivar
were transplanted with 0, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 250 ÂµM CdCl<sub>2</sub> solutions,
respectively, for a 7-day treatment in hydroponics. The Cd-treatment
resulted in significant reductions in the root elongation and the shoot
extension of rice seedlings for each cultivar. According to the Cd
distributions in the root and shoot for the used cultivars, the Cd
absorption by rice plants was predominantly accumulated in the root
rather than transferred to the shoot. The Cd-treatment induced
lignification in the sclerenchyma tissue and in the endodermis and
metaxylem cell walls of the rice root specimens. The lignification of
the cell walls enhancing the Cd sequestration by the root would be
related to the tolerance to Cd toxicity and to the Cd transfer into the
aboveground parts of a rice plant. Much higher Cd concentrations in the
shoot were found for the TY3 and TK9 plants. By contrast, the
translocations of Cd in TNG71, KH145, TKW1, and TKW3 plants were
relatively low. Thus TNG71, KH145, TKW1, and TKW3 would be the
candidates for cultivation to reduce Cd transported into the aboveground
parts of a rice plant. TCS10 and TCS17 cultivars also showed low
translocation of Cd from the root into the shoot, but their Cd
absorption rates in the plant were much higher than the other cultivars.

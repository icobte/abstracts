<p style=text-align:justify>Microbial control of the geochemical behavior of heavy metals and As in
contaminated subsurface was investigated through activation of
indigenous bacteria by organic supply under anaerobic condition. The
results indicated that dissolved Cd, Pb and Zn were microbially removed
from solutions, which was likely due to the formation of metal sulfides
after reduction of natural sulfate by indigenous sulfate-reducing
bacteria. The soil containing a large amount of sulfate resulted in
complete removal of dissolved As after 25 days, while there were gradual
increases in dissolved As concentration in the soils which showed low
sulfate concentrations. Subsequent experiments with sulfate supply were
conducted to identify the effects of sulfate amendment to stimulate
microbial sulfate reduction on heavy metal behaviors. Batch-type
experiments were performed with lactate or glucose as a carbon source to
activate indigenous bacteria under anaerobic condition for 100 days.
Sulfate (250 mg/L) was artificially injected at 60 days after the onset
of the experiments. Lactate supply exerted no significant difference on
the amounts of dissolved Zn, Pb, Ni and Cu between microbial and abiotic
control slurries; however, lower Zn, Pb and Ni and higher Cu
concentrations were observed in the microbial slurries than in the
controls when glucose supplied. Sulfate amendment led to dramatic
decrease in dissolved Cr and maintenance of dissolved As, both of which
had gradually increased over time till the sulfate injection. Black
precipitates formed in solution after sulfate amendment, and violarite
was found via XRD analysis in the microbial precipitates. Conceivably
the mineral might be formed after Fe(III) reduction and microbial
sulfate reduction with coprecipitation of heavy metals. The results
suggested that heavy metals in subsurface may be stabilized in situ by
microbial sulfate reduction, and natural attenuation of the contaminants
can be effectively attained.

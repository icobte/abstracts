<p style=text-align:justify>Nitrogen and potassium nutrients treatment have repair effect on arsenic
pollution in paddy field, but till the date most of them are studied as
a single element treatment. In this study, the hybrid rice Lu You Ming
Zhan was used as the test material and paddy soil with different
concentrations of arsenite addition, i.e. 0, 50 and 100 mg/kg arsenic,
were prepared to investigate the mitigation effect of nitrogen and
potassium combinely in arsenic toxicity, conventional cultivation
condition of rice was used as the reference. The treatment group of this
study consisted of 1.42 and 1.25 times of nitrogen and potassium
respectively with respect to conventional cultivation conditions. The
results showed that the concentration of total arsenic, arsenite and
arsenate in rhizosphere soil solution were all significantly
(<i>p</i>&lt;0.01) decreased at tillering, botting, panicle initiation and
ripening stage in above mentioned nitrogen and Potassium nutrition
regulation group. The total amount of arsenic significantly
(<i>p</i>&lt;0.01) decreased in the mature rice roots, shoots, stems, leaves,
bran and grain. The dry weight of rice roots, shoots, stems, leaves and
rice yield was also significantly (<i>p</i>&lt;0.01) increased. The
combination of high nitrogen and high potassium nutrition has the best
mitigation effect to As toxicity when the concentration of arsenite
pollution was at 50 mg/kg. The repair effect in rice yield and dry
weight of rice organs were also improved at 100mg/kg concentration of
arsenite pollution. Therefore, nitrogen and potassium nutrients could
effectively decrease the arsenic pollution in paddy soil and alleviate
the arsenic toxicity on rice plants.

<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) is nonessential and toxic for rice growth and humans. Rice
is a major dietary source of Cd for Asian populations. Reducing Cd
accumulation in rice grains is an important task. A number of
transporters involved in the uptake or translocation of Cd have been
identified in rice. Previous studies have shown that <i>OsNRAMP5</i> is
constitutively expressed in the roots and encodes a plasma
membrane-localized protein. OsNRAMP5 is polarly localized at the distal
side of both exodermis and endodermis cells. Knockout of <i>OsNRAMP5</i>
resulted in a significant reduction of Cd accumulation in rice roots and
shoots. The aim of this study is to manipulate both the expression and
tissue localization of OsNRAMP5 under the control of the rice <i>OsActin1</i>
promoter. We generated transgenic rice overexpressing <i>OsNRAMP5</i>, and
tested the effect on Cd uptake and translocation. Overexpression of
<i>OsNRAMP5</i> in rice promoted Cd uptake into the roots but decreased Cd
translocation from the roots to the shoots, and decreased Cd
concentration in the shoots markedly. However, overexpression lines had
no significant effect on manganese concentration of shoots, but
increased Mn concentration of roots in hydroponic experiments when
exposed to different Mn concentrations. A short-term Cd uptake
experiment revealed that the <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> of overexpressing lines was more
than two times higher than wild-type. Immunostaining showed that the
overexpressed OsNRAMP5 proteins were localized in all cells of root tips
and lateral root primordium without polarity. Cd imaging indicated the
overexpression lines accumulated higher Cd concentration in the root
tips by using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). In
addition, overexpressing lines showed much stronger intensity of Cd
green fluorescens in the epithelial cells and vascular bundle of mature
roots compared with the wild-type, in agreement with the results of the
Cd concentration. When grown in two Cd-contaminated paddy soils,
overexpression lines contained significantly lower Cd concentration in
rice grains than the wild-type without disturbing accumulation of
essential nutrients. Overexpression of <i>OsNRAMP5</i> contributed to flux of
Cd from the stele, restricting xylem loading of Cd consequently. Taken
together, our study has shown that overexpression of <i>OsNRAMP5</i> can
reduce Cd accumulation in rice grains effectively.

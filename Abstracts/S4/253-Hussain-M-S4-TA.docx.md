<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) contamination is emerging as a serious health and
environmental issue globally especially in the South and South-east
Asian countries including Pakistan, India and Bangladesh. In contrast to
oxic soil environments, mobility and bioavailability of As to rice under
(reduced) paddy soil conditions is an emerging issue to food security
and human health. This is because rice is a staple food of about 3
billion people throughout the world including in India, Pakistan and
Bangladesh and it accumulates As in paddy soil environments. The
objectives of the present study were to: (1) explore the accumulation of
As in different parts of rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) plants of the two
contrasting rice genotypes (Kainat and KSK-385), and (2) evaluate the
effect of As on morphological and biochemical parameters of rice plants.
Six types of organic (farm yard manure (FYM), cow dung (CD), biogas
slurry (BGS), mixed biomaterials waste (MBW)) and inorganic (gypsum,
lignite) amendments were applied to determine their impact on soil As
availability and uptake by the two rice genotypes. Arsenic-contaminated
irrigation water was applied to rice plants after 15 days of
transplantation in three intervals – each irrigation contained 15 mg
As/L (400 mL per 2 kg soil). We found that the percentage increase in
number of tillers ranged from 28–51% and tiller length spanned 28–50%
with the maximum values obtained for FYM over their respective control
for KSK-385 genotype. In the case of Kainat genotype, number of tillers
and tiller length ranged from 41–50% and 18–33%, respectively, with the
maximum values attained for CD treatment compared to control. This study
highlights that organic amendments, notably FYM and CD, could possibly
have nutritional effect, although contrasting, on the growth of two rice
genotypes under As stress, thus providing an essential strategy to
mitigate As accumulation in rice under paddy soil conditions. Our
further analysis of As in rice tissue and in different soil fractions
will help identify As bioavailability and transfer in paddy-soil rice
system.

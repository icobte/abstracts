<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) yellow pigments (mainly the CdS) are lightfast, stable at
high temperatures, intensely colored and migration-resistant so they are
widely used in the coloring of engineering plastics, painting, and
ceramics, which may be related to the soil Cd pollution. Moreover, Cd
accumulation in rice grains poses a potential health risk via the food
chain and was also the major contributor to the human intake of Cd
worldwide, especially in Asia. Therefore, based on diffusive gradient in
thin-film (DGT) and planar optodes (PO), the two-dimensional dynamics
and toxicity of Cd and the mechanism in situ that control the solubility
of Cd yellow pigment and Cd bioavailability in rice rhizosphere were
investigated for better evaluating environmental exposure. The results
showed that although Cd yellow pigment was insoluble complex, Cd can be
released from the Cd yellow pigment and entered into the soil solution,
which can be influenced by the bacterial activity. The rice rhizosphere
altered solubility of the Cd yellow pigment and Cd distribution in the
rhizosphere, enhancing the potential risk of Cd yellow pigment. Different O<sub>2</sub> saturation in the
rhizosphere can influence bioavailability of Cd from Cd yellow pigment
through the change of Fe(II) mobilization and the oxidation of S<sup>2-</sup> to
SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>. An acidification and chelation in the rhizosphere may be also
one of the reason for enhancing Cd concentration in the rhizosphere than
the bulk soil.
High-throughput sequencing also indicated that the toxicity of Cd yellow
pigment was related to the microbial activity. Summary, the insoluble Cd
yellow pigment can increase the risk of Cd uptake in rice. In future, it
is possible to investigate in situ the stability of remediation
treatments and remobilization of Cd yellow pigment with the extension of
the time in rice rhizosphere.

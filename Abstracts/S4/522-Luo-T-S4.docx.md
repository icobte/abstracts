<p style=text-align:justify>Elevated levels of the carcinogen arsenic (As), from both geogenic and
anthropogenic sources, are found in coastal wetland soils. In the
coastal environment, the saltwater inundation and ebb tide can induce
anaerobic conditions in soils. However, the effect of anaerobic microbe
on As reduction and mobility in coastal wetland with high sulfate has
not been reported, and the underlying mechanisms of this process remain
poorly understood.

<p style=text-align:justify>This study investigated speciation transformation and redistribution of
As in coastal wetland soil under anaerobic conditions using incubation
experiments and molecular biology techniques. The effect of microbial
sulfidogenesis on these processes was examined by addition of sulfate to
the incubation systems. The biotic incubation results clearly revealed
that As was reduced to As(III) and released in the early stage of the
incubation. Dissolved As(III) and total As concentrations all increased
and reached the maximum values of 12.0 and 64.8 Î¼g/L, respectively,
either sulfate addition or not. In contrast, As(V) reduction was not
observed, and total As concentration was lower in abiotic experiments.
In the later stage of the incubation, dissloved As(III) and total As
concentrations decreased and resequestered into the solid phase. The XRD
and soil sequential extraction analysis indicated that the new mineral
of Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> was formed, and the dissolved As in the solid was
re-adsorbed on new formed Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> mineral primarily in the later stage
of the incubation. Moreover, the relative abundances of the bacterial
16S rRNA gene were examined. The results indicated that the
Proteobacteria(52-60%), Chloroflexi(14-19%), Actinobacteria(6-10%), and
Firmicutes(7%) occupied the majority in biotic experiments. The sulfate
reducing bacteria <i>Desulfocapsa</i> from the Proteobacteria was detected in
biotic incubation. Our findings suggest that the anaerobic microbial
including sulfate reducing bacteria (<i>Desulfocapsa</i>) can stimulate the
reduction and release of As in coastal wetland sulfur-rich soil,
although part of the released As re-adsorbed on new formed iron mineral.

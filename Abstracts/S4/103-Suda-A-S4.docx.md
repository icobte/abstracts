<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) is one of the hazardous elements that is ubiquitous in
soils. Since soil As dissolves into soil solution under reduced
conditions, paddy rice plants are susceptible to uptake As from soil.
Application of organic amendments (OAMs) potentially accelerate As
solubilization through the following mechanisms: reductive dissolution
of As(V) and As-bearing Fe oxides, inhibition of As sorption, and
formation of soluble complexes with As. On the contrary, some studies
demonstrated that application of OAMs inhibited As dissolution from
soils. To find the cause of these discrepancy, the objectives of the
present study were (1) to compare As solubility in flooded soils amended
with different types of OAMs, and (2) to clarify the important factor to
determine As solubility in soils amended with OAMs.

<p style=text-align:justify>A surface paddy soil was collected and passed through a 2-mm mesh sieve.
The soil had 7.42 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> of HCl-extractable As. We used 15 OAMs from
three different sources, namely (1) plant-based composts (PBCs), (2)
cattle manures (CMs), and (3) fermented livestock (swine and poultry)
droppings (FLDs). They were milled mechanically and were sieved through
1-mm mesh sieves with keeping moisture in them. Their carbon to nitrogen
ratio (C/N) ranged from 5.1 to 45.7, and the average of C/N of each
source of OAM decreased in the order of PBCs&gt;CMs&gt;FLDs. Moist soil
(10 g as oven-dried basis) and OAM (0.05 g as oven-dried basis) were
mixed with ultra-pure water to bring the total water up to 30 mL in a
glass vial. Corresponding vials without OAM (control soils) were also
prepared. Vials were tightly capped after N<sub>2</sub> gas purging, then were
manually shaken well. They were incubated at 30 °C for a specific period
with shaking every 2 or 3 days. After incubation, the soil solution was
collected and immediately acidified. The acidified soil solution was
diluted and used for As measurement by ICP-MS. Residual soil suspension
was used for measuring pH and Eh.

<p style=text-align:justify>After incubation, all soils with FLD contained significantly greater
dissolved As than those with control soils at 10 and 39 days after
incubation. The dissolved As in soils with two CMs were also
significantly greater than control soils at day 39, while the rest of
the OAMs did not promote As solubilization. The amounts of dissolved As
in all soils eventually became comparable at 80 days. Averaged relative
ratio of dissolved As in soils with FLBs to control soils was
significantly greater than those with the PBCs and CMs at days 10 and 39
(<i>P</i> &lt; 0.05, Turkey test). Amendment C/N and soil Eh were positively
correlated at days 10 and 39 (Spearman’s rank correlation), indicating
amendments with low C/N have high bio-decomposability. Conversely, the
dissolved As was negatively correlated with C/N, reflecting a negative
relationship between dissolved As and soil Eh. Furthermore, the addition
of OAMs did not substantially change the relationship between dissolved
As and soil Eh. These results indicated that acceleration of soil
reduction was the major cause of increased As solubilization by OAMs.
Therefore, we concluded that FLDs have a greater potential of
solubilizing As than PBCs and CMs during short time after flooding soil,
because of their greater ability for accelerating soil reduction
associated with their higher bio-decomposability.

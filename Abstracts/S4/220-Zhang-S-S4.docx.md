<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) affect rice under different redox regimes
with As more bioavailable under flooded conditions and Cd more
bioavailable under nonflooded conditions. Recent work has shown that Si
addition to paddy soils can alleviate As and Cd bioaccumulation in rice.
Biochar derived from Si-rich rice husk could provide sufficient Si to
compete with arsenite for plant-uptake while also increasing Cd sorption
in soil but requires optimization to create the best conditions for
minimizing both As and Cd under a variety of water/redox regimes. Here,
we prepared biochars under different physicochemical conditions and
tested their ability to decrease As and Cd accumulation in rice. We
expected that soil incorporation of biochar with sufficient
plant-available Si and other nutrients combined with alternate wetting
and drying (AWD) will maintain or increase rice yields while minimizing
plant As and Cd. Biogeochemical processes of Si, As, and Cd and their
bioaccumulation will be discussed in detail regarding implementable
chemical and agronomic strategies to ensure food security.

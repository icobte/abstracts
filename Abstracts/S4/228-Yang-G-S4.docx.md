<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenite [As(III)] is the predominant arsenic (As) species in flooded
paddy soil, As(III) bioaccumulation in rice grains has been identified
as a major problem in many countries of the world. Arsenite oxidation
can be accelerated by bacterial catalysis, but the effects of bacterial
catalysis on accelerated As(III) oxidation in flooded paddy soil are
poorly understood. Herein we investigated how an arsenite-oxidizing
bacterium GD03, namely Achromobacter xylosoxidans, influences As(III)
oxidation in flooded paddy soil, As(III) toxicity and translocation from
paddy soil to rice grain. Rice seedlings of Guang You Ming 118 (GYM) at
four-leaf-stage was inoculated with different inoculation percent of
GD03 into potting soil added by 100 mg/kg As(III) to investigate the
effect of GD03 on accelerated As(III) oxidation in flooded paddy soil
and its effects on arsenic toxicity and translocation from paddy soil to
rice grain. The results showed that GD03 significantly (p &lt; 0.01)
accelerated the oxidation of As(III) in soil solution of GYM indica
cultivar stressed by As(III) after 1d’s inoculation. GD03 increased Eh
value of soil solution the most at booting stage of indica cultivar GYM
stressed by As(III). As for different percent of GD03 inoculation, the
treatment with 7.2×10<sup>9</sup> CFU GD03 /kg soil had the highest Eh value and
the lowest As(III) concentration in soil solution of indica cultivar GYM
stressed by As(III) from 1 d’s inoculation till Maturation Stage and
showed the best subdued As(III) toxicity at its each growth stage. The
inoculation of GD03 led to 59% to 96% increase in rice grain yield, as
well as 35% to 57% of As(III) concentration decrease in rice grain.
Therefore, the accelerated oxidation for As(III) in flooded paddy soil
was a promising method to mitigate As(III) induced human health risk.

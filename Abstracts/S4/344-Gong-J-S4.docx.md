<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) is a nonessential heavy metal toxic to all organisms. Daily
consumption of Cd contaminated rice has caused Itai-Itai disease in
Japan. Cd in rice was found as high as 1–2 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> in some areas in
China and is much higher than the national standard 0.2 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>
(GB2762-2005), imposing great threat to both food security and safety.
Therefore, reducing Cd accumulation in rice grains is highly demanded.

<p style=text-align:justify>Previous QTL analysis identified <i>OsHMA3</i> and <i>CAL1</i> as two important
players in Cd translocation between roots and shoots. OsHMA3 regulates
cadmium translocation via the modulation of vacuolar sequestration
capacity for Cd in rice roots. CAL1 encodes a defensin-like protein,
which facilitates Cd loading into xylem vessels by chelation and the
subsequent secretion from cytosol to apoplastic compartments. Here we
reported the mapping and isolation of another major QTL SQ9, using the
previously reported parental varieties CJ06 and TN01 as the derived
mapping population. SQ9 is located on Chromosome 2 and contributes about
20% of the overall variance in Cd accumulation in rice grains. Pilot
experiments showed that overexpression of the SQ9<sup>TN1</sup> increased Cd
concentration in grains with CJ06 background, while reduced Cd
concentrations in grains was observed in the knock-out mutants of SQ9 in
TN1 background. We will further report and discuss the underlying
mechanisms.

<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium (Cd) is a key environmental contaminant in New Zealand
agricultural systems that is associated with the long-term application
of high rates of superphosphate fertilizer. Although Cd is considered to
be a non-essential element for plants, it is effectively absorbed by the
root system of many plant species and can be subsequently transported
throughout the plant. Recent studies have shown that the forage species
chicory (<i>Cichorium intybus L.</i>) and plantain (<i>Plantago</i> <i>lanceolate
L.</i>) accumulate a significantly higher shoot Cd concentration than the
traditional pasture species ryegrass and clover. Forage crops are now
common in New Zealand farm systems, and the potential implications of
elevated Cd on food safety are actively being explored. The current
study was designed to assess Cd uptake in forage species as a function
of Cd soil chemistry in the rhizosphere. Cadmium complexed to organic
compounds can be separated and quantified using gel exclusion and high
performance liquid chromatography. However, the determination of free
Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions in rhizosphere soil and plant sap presents an analytical
challenge. To achieve the aims of the current study, methodology needed
to be developed to quantify different Cd species such as, free Cd<sup>2+</sup>
ion and Cd complexed with different organic compounds in both the
rhizosphere soil and plant sap. Low-cost electrochemical methods such as
stripping voltammetry (SV), which use working electrodes that have been
selected for activity to target metals, show promise for monitoring low
concentrations of free Cd<sup>2+</sup> in environmental samples. In the current
study a chemically modified carbon paste electrode to determine free
Cd<sup>2+</sup> ions was developed. The electrode was used with square wave
anodic stripping voltammetry for analytical determinations. A carbon
paste electrode was first prepared using graphite powder mixed with
Bi<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> as the electrode carbon source. Free Cd<sup>2+</sup> was
pre-concentrated on the surface of the modified electrode at âˆ’1.2 V vs.
Ag/AgCl and then re-oxidized during a stripping step. The accuracy of
measurements was validated against screen printed carbon paste
electrodes. In initial work, the lower limit of detection of this
electrode was 0.2 mg Cd<sup>2+</sup>/L solution. Further development of the
electrode using sugar charcoal as the carbon source mixed with a novel
Cd<sup>2+</sup> ion binding ligand is currently in progress to reduce the
detection limit to nanomolar levels. This paper explains the systematic
development of a chemically modified carbon paste electrode that can be
used for the determination of free Cd<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration in
rhizosphere soil solution and plant sap.

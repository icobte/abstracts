<p style="text-align:justify">Organism activities in soil are able to alter drastically
physical-chemical properties, such as pH and dissolved organic matter
(DOM) in the bio-influenced area such as rhizosphere for plants and
drilosphere for earthworms. These modifications may drive trace element
(TE) availability in soil and their bioavailability to soil organisms
but with no consistent trends as shown by a literature overview. In this
work we studied the effects of plant-earthworm interactions on the
copper (Cu) availability in rhizosphere and its consequences on Cu
phytoavailability in soils receiving either mineral fertilizers or
organic inputs.

<p style="text-align:justify">Plant-earthworm interactions were studied with the RHIZOtest, a biotest
that enables to grow plants with their roots in contact with the soil
layer (considered as the rhizosphere) but not prenetrating it. The
RHIZOtest was deployed here in an original manner: (i) without plant and
earthworm (i.e. bulk soil), (ii) with plants (<i>Festuca arrundinaceae</i>)
only (i.e. rhizosphere), (iii) with epi-endogeic earthworms
(<i>Dichogaster saliens</i>) only (i.e. drilosphere), and (iv) with both
plants and earthworms (i.e. rhizo-drilosphere). Two soil samples from
the same decadal field experiment were studied, one amended with mineral
fertilizers that led to a strongly acidic pH (5.0) and a low organic
carbon content (2.0 %) and the other amended with cow slurries that led
to a ca. neutral pH (6.5) and much higher organic carbon content
(2.9 %). In order to study the pH as a key parameter, the pH was
manipulated and controlled in the rhizosphere, drilosphere, and
rhizo-drilosphere either by favoring alkalization or by maintaining the
initial bulk-soil pH. Copper availability was determined in bulk soils,
rhizospheres, drilospheres and rhizo-drilospheres following (i) a
kinetic approach based on the diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) and
(ii) an equilibrium approach based on the measurements of total Cu
concentration and Cu<sup>2+</sup> activity in soil solution. The drivers of Cu
speciation in soil solution were assessed by modelling using the
windermere humic aqueous model (WHAM). Copper phytoavailability was
determined by estimating Cu uptake flux in plants.

<p style="text-align:justify">Results showed that plants and earthworms respectively increased
rhizosphere and drilosphere pH when the bulk-soil pH was initially
strongly acidic, and decreased rhizosphere and drilosphere DOM
concentration. Overall, such physical-chemical changes in the
rhizosphere and the drilosphere led to a decrease in Cu availability
compared to the initial bulk soil. Results of the biotests are discussed
taken into account the hypothesis that plants and earthworms act
synergistically to further reduce Cu availability in the
rhizo-drilosphere.

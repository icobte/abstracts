<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic (As) is an ubiquitous toxin in the environment and contamination
of paddy soils with elavated levels of As presents a threat to food
safety. The status of soil redox potential has a substantial impact on
the speciation and the subsequent mobilization of As in paddy soils. The
rice rhizospheric microenvironment is more oxidized than the bulk soil.
How this rhizospheric effect affects the biogeochemical processes
associated with the transformations of As remains poorly understood. In
this study, we used a novel rhizobox with a field As-contaminated soil
(101.2 mg As kg<sup>-1</sup>) to investigate the <i>in situ</i> transformation of As
in the rhizosphere of two rice cultivars which differs in the radial
oxygen loss (ROL). Results showed that during the rice seedling stage,
dissolved concentrations of As in the rhizospheric porewater were
2.2-3.1 fold higher than those in the bulk soil, with the As
concentrations decreasing with the distance from the root surface. The
decreasing rate can be modelled through a reciprocal eqution [y= 378.3+
283.8/(0.3743+ x), R<sup>2</sup>= 0.97]. Along the root profile, dissolved As
concentrations decreased from the root tip to the mature zone, with the
former being 32.4%-63.7% higher than the latter during different growth
stages of two rice cultivars. Among the dissolved As species,
rhizospheric concentartions of arsenate (As(V)) were 38.4%-64.3% lower
in the cultivar Yangdao (with a higher ROL) than those in the cultivar
Shenyou, despite a similar total dissolved As. This is likely attributed
to a higher ROL in Yangdao which can promote the the formation of iron
oxides (e.g. iron plaque) on the root surface, increasing As(V)
adsorption. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing data showed that
iron-reducing bacteria could play an important role in the coupling of
As(V) and ferric (Fe(III)) reduction, including the <i>geobacter</i> and
<i>clostrium</i>, which were increased by 3.1 and 12.4 times in the
rhizosphere compared with those in the bulk soil, respectively. The As
functional genes such as arsenite (As(III)) oxidase gene (<i>aioA</i>), As(V)
reductase gene (<i>arsC</i>), As(V) respiratory reductase gene (<i>arrA</i>) and
As(III) methyltransferase gene (<i>arsM</i>) were found 18.2, 13.8, 3.1 and
1.6 times higher in the rhizosphere than those in the bulk soil,
respectively. These data show that the biogeochemical processes of As
and Fe occurred in the rhozosphere can influence As mobilization in soil
and subsequent availabiity to rice plants.

<p style="text-align:justify">Microbial hotspots, defined as small soil volumes with much faster
reaction rates and much more intensive interactions in soils, make
significant contributions to the biogeochemical cycling. Rhizosphere and
root-detritusphere are two typical hotspots which dominate the element
transferring between soils and plants. Labile flux maxima of As can be
observed both in rice rhizosphere and root-detritusphere areas,
specifically in root tips for living root and along the root axis for
dead root. However, in contrast to the spatial distribution of As
bioavailability, significant depletion of P labile flux was found around
both the living and dead roots. The P labile flux decreases by 68–76% in
the root-detritusphere area (2–4 mm from the root axis), similar to the
spatial patterns of Fe. Decomposition of dead roots might provide
channels for O<sub>2</sub> diffusion, supporting the aerobic microsites in deeper
soils and leading to the lower kinetics of P exchange process from soils
to soil solution. Generally, the in-situ high resolution methods
combining DGT-LA-ICPMS and planar optode support a more holistic
understanding of biogeochemical processes of elements in the soil
hotspots.

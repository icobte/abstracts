<p style="text-align:justify">The rhizosphere is the volume of soil where the chemical (pH, redox
potential, nutrient concentration and root exudates), physical
(temperature, water availability and soil structure) and biological
characteristics (microbial associations) are shaped by
plant-microbe-soil interactions. Communications between roots and
between soil microorganisms and roots, i.e. rhizosphere processes, occur
and change continuously influencing for instance the nutrients
availability, their soil transport and plant uptake. The main driving
force of these mechanisms seems to be related to root exudation
processes. Root exudates comprise in fact a number of different organic
(e.g. low molecular weight and high molecular weight organic compounds)
and inorganic (e.g. protons and HCO<sub>3</sub>) chemicals and can reach
concentrations up to 250 mg C /g root produced of the photosynthetically
fixed carbon.

<p style="text-align:justify">Several nutrients, in particular trace elements, are mainly either
adsorbed or structural components of soil minerals, i.e. the
quantitatively largest fraction in soil. Root exudates might interact
with the minerals leading to mineral weathering and thus to the
mobilization of trace elements with a consequent increase in their plant
available fraction. However, root exudates have short half-lives because
of the large microbial activity at the soil–root interface, which might
limit their effects on nutrient mobility and acquisition. In addition,
exudates also have a selective effect on the microbial community present
in the rhizosphere. The presentation provides an overview of the
rhizosphere processes involved in nutrients acquisition by soil
organisms (plants and microorganisms) focusing in particular on
micronutrients (iron and copper). In particular, the presentation
provides information on (i) nutrients availability in soils, including
mineral weathering, ligand and element competition and plant-microbe
competition; (ii) microbe–plant interactions, focusing on beneficial
microbial communities and their association with plants, and (iii)
plant–soil interactions involving the metabolic changes triggered by
nutrient deficiency and the processes involved in exudate release from
roots.

<p style="text-align:justify">Mineral raw materials are essential to support ongoing technological
advances, such as energy production from renewable sources. Phytomining
constitutes a non-destructive technology for the recovery of metals
which could be potentially applied to obtaining scarce (rare earth
elements (REEs), tungsten (W)) or valuable (gold (Au)) elements. Soil
microbial processes involved in metal mobility and availability to
plants represent a central role in the phytoextraction efficiency of
metals such as Ni, but their involvement in the case of rare elements is
unclear. In this context, the objectives of the present work were to (a)
identify, in areas of geological interest, plant species which possess
the ability to extract and accumulate trace elements and (b) isolate and
characterize the rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with this
vegetation and elucidate bacterial mechanisms involved in the
geochemical cycling of strategic elements, with the view to developing
phytomining techniques for the recovery of strategic elements.

<p style="text-align:justify">Exploratory studies were conducted in two abandoned opencast mines in NW
Spain. The mines were dedicated to the extraction of either, tungsten
(W) and copper (Cu) in San Finx (Galicia), or gold (Au) and molybdenum
(Mo) in Salave (Asturias). Samples of the dominant vegetation, rocks,
bulk and rhizosphere soil were collected in different locations of each
mine area. Trace element concentrations in soils and in the aboveground
plant biomass were determined by ICP-MS. Rhizosphere bacteria were
isolated from the soil and screened for W and Mo resistance, ability to
produce organic acids, siderophores, biosurfactants, IAA and phosphate
solubilisation capacity. Batch culture assays using selected bacterial
strains and ground rock, or soil, were performed to evaluate their
weathering capacities. Significant concentrations of the REEs La, Ce and
Y, as well as Mo, were detected in both mine areas, which were for some
plant species reflected in their aboveground tissues. <i>Salix</i> spp.,
<i>Erica</i> spp. (in San Finx) and <i>Pteridium</i> spp. (in Salave) harboured a
higher number of bacterial isolates with ability to produce siderophores
and surfactants, whereas the tolerance to high concentrations of W and
Mo was generalised amongst most bacterial isolates. Furthermore, the
growth and activity of different bacterial strains induced the
mobilisation of different critical or valuable elements after their
incubation with soil from Salave or San Finx.

<p style="text-align:justify">To conclude, the prospection of abandoned mining areas could allow the
identification of plant species with capacity to accumulate rare
elements, further our understanding of the microbial communities
inhabiting these soils and identify beneficial bacterial strains with
application in phytomining techniques.

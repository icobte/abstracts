<p style="text-align:justify">Fluorine (F) is a key environmental contaminant associated with the
long-term high application rates of superphosphate fertiliser
particularly on soils used for dairying and horticulture in New Zealand.
These elevated soil F concentrations may have the potential to
negatively impact soil microorganisms which underpin New Zealand’s
agricultural economy. Ongoing soil F monitoring requires an accurate and
simple test to establish comprehensive soil F management practices, and
quantify both the total and bioavailable concentration of F in soil. In
order to assess both total and bioavailable F concentrations in New
Zealand agricultural soils, we developed standard methodologies at
Massey University. We found that the bioavailable F concentrations in
New Zealand pastoral soils are ranging from 1.70 to 6.45 mg/kg (F<sup>-</sup>
concentration in soil solution &lt; 0.58 mg/L); two orders of magnitude
lower than that of total F.

<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Rhizobium leguminosarum,</i> is a Nitrogen fixing soil bacteria which is a
fundamental component of New Zealand’s legume-based pastoral farming.
Currently, there is no data available to determine whether New Zealand’s
bioavailable F concentrations in soil are harmful to <i>Rhizobium</i> <i>leguminosarum</i>. We found that the normal rod-shaped bacterium
cell was morphologically altered when <i>Rhizobium</i> was exposed to
fluoride concentration above 100 mg/L through a laboratory incubation
experiment. This concentration is orders of magnitude higher than those
recorded for New Zealand agriculture soils under ‘normal conditions’.
Therefore, there is no indication of an imminent risk by soil F to
<i>Rhizobium</i> <i>leguminosarum.</i>

<p style="text-align:justify">Allophanic soils in NZ where increasing F concentration is of great
concern, due to significant fertilisation history and F retention. Our
glasshouse trial with two white clover varieties growing in allophanic
soil at varying levels of soil F (80-400 mg/kg), indicated no
significant influence of soil F on plants or soil microbial activities.
The study suggests that F concentrations equivalent up to 50 years of F
accumulation, through the application of phosphate fertiliser to
potentially high-risk New Zealand soils, doesn’t have immediate effect
on soil or environmental health.

<p style="text-align:justify">This information seeks to provide better understanding of soil F and its
influence on legume based pasture crops in New Zealand.

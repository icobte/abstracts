<p style="text-align:justify">The mechanistic interactions between EDDS with trace metals and major
components in rhizospheric soil determine the bioavailability of metals
in contaminated soils and subsequent phytoextraction application, which
is not thoroughly understood. This study aims to investigate the
macroscopic and molecular interactions of EDDS with Cu in the
rhizosphere and the non-rhizosphere of Cu mine polluted agricultural
soil. A multi-interlayer rhizobox planted with ryegrass was used to
study the transport of EDDS and Cu from the non-rhizosphere to the
rhizosphere. The results showed that EDDS (5 mM kg<sup>-1</sup>) obviously
dissociated Cu (by 285-690-fold), Fe (by 3.47-60.2-fold), and Al (by
2.43-5.31-fold) into the soluble fraction from soil composite compared
to the control without EDDS. The combination of micro-X-ray
fluorescence, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and sequential extraction
analysis revealed that EDDS primarily chelated with Cu from the adsorbed
fraction with goethite instead of clay minerals; this phenomenon is
probably due to the dissolution of Fe oxides promoted by EDDS. Moreover,
as facilitated by ryegrass transpiration, EDDS and Cu were transported
from the non-rhizosphere to the rhizosphere and accumulated in the
latter. Cu was transported in the form of a CuEDDS complex with no
competition from Fe and Al via solution modelling, due to a stronger
complexation role of EDDS with Cu. The <i>in situ</i> mechanisms of Cu
extraction and transport by EDDS in the rhizosphere are first elucidated
with multiple speciation analysis methods, which are important in the
application and improvement of EDDS-assisted phytoextraction in
field-contaminated soils.

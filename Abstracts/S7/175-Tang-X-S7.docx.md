<p style="text-align:justify">The heavy metal contaminants in soil can damage soil productivity and
consequently made the agricultural production suffered heavy losses. In
China, it’s a common sense that the vegetable field is suffering Cd
enrichment. Lettuce, a widely consumed vegetable, is very sensitive to
the presence of toxic elements in soil, and these elements can
accumulate in the edible parts of the plant and do harm to human body
thorough the food chain. So it’s very important to know how the lettuce
response when the soil was polluted by Cd. In our early study we found
that Cd uptake in lettuce differed significantly among several lettuce
cultivars after planted in a same Cd-contaminated field. We thought this
difference may due to the different reactions of lettuce root exudation
to cadmium stress, and to test it a hydroponic culture experiment was
implemented. In this study, four lettuce varieties (‘American fast
growing lettuce’, ‘Daxiangsheng No.2’, ‘FashiCai Huaye Kuju’ and ‘Lisheng
No.2’) were cultivated in 10 mg·L<sup>-1</sup> Cd contained Hoagland solution for
three weeks. The water culture method was used to obtain the root
secretion solution at the end of every week. The TOC content
(mg·L<sup>-1</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup>) of the root secretion solution was used to characterize
lettuce roots secretion capacity, the 3D fluorescence spectrum scan
results of the root secretion solution was used to characterize types of
lettuce roots secretion, the soil extracted cadmium concentration by the
root secretion solution was used to characterize the capacity of lettuce
roots secretion to activate soil cadmium. The results showed that the
roots secretion capacity was increased by incubation time, while the
number of root secretion and cadmium activation capacity of root
secretion showed a trend of decrease. The root secretion capacity was
both significant negative related to the root secretion activate ability
to soil cadmium (r= 0.78，P &lt;0.01)， and types of root secretion
(r=0.59，P&lt;0.01), while the root secretion activate ability to soil
cadmium was significant positive related to the types of root secretion
(r=0.69，P&lt;0.01). That meant while under cadmium stress, the lettuce
roots secretion capacity would increase while the types of root
secretion would decrease, that would result in the reducing of Cd
activation ability of the lettuce root secretion.

<p style=text-align:justify>Subsurface settings in aquatic ecosystems display strong coupling
between hydrologic conditions and the cycling of carbon, nitrogen, and
other major elements as well as trace element micronutrients and
contaminants. In many such systems, including wetland soils and the
hyporheic zone of streambeds, anaerobic processes are responsible for a
number of biogeochemical processes with substantial environmental
impacts. These include servings as major sources of the greenhouse gases
methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) as well as being key locations
of Hg methylation. The biogeochemistry of subsurface zones of aquatic
systems has been widely explored from the perspective of redox
conditions, substrate availability, and thermodynamic controls on
metabolic processes. However, an additional yet under-examined
constraint is the availability of trace element micronutrients. An array
of metalloenzymes that contain trace elements in cofactors are essential
to many metabolic pathways that underlie important biogeochemical
processes. Pure culture studies have demonstrated inhibition of
methanogenesis, denitrification, and Hg methylation when essential trace
elements have low availability. However, similar studies of natural
systems are rare, and it is unclear if trace element availability limits
biogeochemical processes in the environment. We have investigated
possible trace element limitations during methanogenesis in anaerobic
peat and muck horizons from wetland soils from two U.S. states, Missouri
and Florida. 40-day incubations of wetland soil from the Missouri site
showed a 10-fold increase in CH<sub>4</sub> production following addition of Ni,
which is required in all enzymatic pathways to CH<sub>4</sub>. In contrast, soil
from the Florida site showed no change in CH<sub>4</sub> production following the
addition of Ni or other trace elements involved in the enzymatic
pathways for methanogenesis. Surprisingly, the Florida wetland showed
lower native dissolved and solid-phase trace element concentrations than
the Missouri site yet produced more CH<sub>4</sub> in unamended systems. X-ray
absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that Ni added to the Missouri
soil bound to reduced sulfur, possibly as a mixture of NiS and
thiol-bound Ni, but formed carboxyl-bound species in the Florida site.
This is consistent with the 100-times greater S content of the Missouri
soil as well as a larger reduced S fraction. Speciation of the native Ni
present at both sites appeared to be similar, occurring as mixtures of
sulfur- and carboxyl-bound species, but XAS provided limited information
because of the low solid-phase Ni contents (6-25 ppm) in the soils.
X-ray microfluorescence imaging indicated that Ni was associated with
both organic and inorganic sulfur species in the Missouri soil, but did
not correlate with sulfur in the Florida soil. Together, these
observations suggest that sulfur speciation and abundance strongly
impact trace element availability and associated limitations on other
biogeochemical processes in wetlands. This work highlights the critical
need to understand the speciation of trace elements in soil and aquatic
systems in order to predict their impact on their environment, a key
theme of Prof. Spark's long research career. It also demonstrates the
challenges posed to determining trace element speciation in natural
materials at low concentrations, necessitating novel approaches and
further advances in analytical instrumentation.

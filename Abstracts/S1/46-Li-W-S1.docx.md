<p style=text-align:justify>Zn stable isotope signatures have proved effective in tracking Zn
sources in polluted environments, however, interactions between Zn in
solution and in minerals in soils and sediments can lead to notable Zn
isotope fractionation and affect Zn source identification. Therefore, it
is important to understand Zn isotope fraction during its sorption onto
soil minerals and the underlying mechanism. In this study, we quantify
zinc isotope fractionation during its sorption onto Al oxide, by
performing experiments under various pH and total Zn concentrations and
measuring Zn isotope signature using Multicollector-Inductively Coupled
Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). Results showed a systematic
enrichment in heavy Zn isotopes on the surface of Al oxide, with Δ<sup>66</sup>Zn
adsorbed-solution ranging from 0.50±0.16‰ at low pH (e.g., pH 6) and low
concentration (e.g., 0.2 mM) to 0.10 ± 0.02‰ at high pH (e.g., pH7.5)
and high concentration (e.g., 0.8 mM). These different magnitudes of Zn
fractionation are related to structural differences between Zn sorption
mechanism existing on the high pH (octahedrally coordinated Zn by oxygen
atoms) and low pH (tetrahedrally coordinated Zn by oxygen atoms), as
evidenced by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS)
spectroscopy. EXAFS analysis also suggest Zn-Al layered double hydroxide
(LDH) formed at high pH and high concentration, the structure of which
has a Zn-O bond distance of 2.06 Å. In contrast, at low pH or low
concentration, results from EXAFS indicates Zn sorbed as an inner-sphere
surface complex, with Zn-O interatomic distance being 1.99 Å. These two
distinct mechanisms indicate that Zn isotope fractionation is dominantly
controlled by the chemical composition of the solution (pH,
concentration) and these factors should be considered when using Zn
isotope to track pollution source.

<p style=text-align:justify>A major impediment to develop a better understanding of microscopic
interface process (such as nucleation, aggregation, growth, dissolution
and phase transformation) of mineral in environmental soil science is a
lack of <i>in situ</i> techniques at sufficiently high spatial and temporal
resolution. The recent advent of liquid cell transmission electron
microscopy (LCTEM) allows directly observing important dynamic events of
nanomaterials in fluid. Here,
<p style=text-align:justify>LCTEM was utilized to directly observe aggregation and dissolution
behaviours of different sized hematite nanoparticles in liquid. When
mass concentrations were same, the aggregates of 9 nm nanoparticles were
statistically more compact and slightly larger than those of 36 nm
nanoparticles. Increasing ionic strength resulted in larger aggregates
and also enhanced the attachment efficiency between small aggregates in
water which directly confirms the DLVO theory that the lower energy
barrier to aggregation as ionic strength increases. Dissolution behavior
of isolated and aggregated hematite particles in 10, 36, and 103 nm,
respectively, was also investigated using LCTEM in water under a
relative high beam dose rate. The high spatial and temporal resolution
of LCTEM enables us to differentiate the respective effect of primary
particle size, crystal defects, and aggregation state on particle
dissolution. At similar electron-beam irradiation parameters, the
initial surface-area normalized dissolution rates (<i>R<sub>SA,Int<sub></i>) of
isolated 10, 36, and 103 nm particles are 4.64 ± 3.60, 0.91 ± 0.44, and
0.24 ± 0.04 mg m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Interface free energy,
    calculated from the measured <i>R<sub>SA,Int<sub></i>, decreases with decreasing
primary particle size. Furthermore, the mode of dissolution switched
from surface-retreat in the relatively defect-free smaller particles to
defect-based dissolution in the larger particles. In dissolution of
aggregated particles, dissolution occurs more rapidly on the particles
that are more accessible to bulk solution than the others in one
aggregate. As dissolution proceeds, dendritic aggregates break into
several smaller aggregates that respectively shrink into smaller and
more compact aggregates, followed by reaggregation together. This study
directly presented the influences of particle size and ionic strength on
aggregation state and shows microscopic dissolution behavior of isolated
and aggregated particles in different primary particle sizes, which is
important to understand bioavailability, transport, and fate of
nanoparticles in aquatic systems.

<p style=text-align:justify>With over-extraction of groundwater, excess fluoride greater than
1.5mg/L (i.e. WHO standard) exposed to people, causing severe
environmental and health problems. Interaction of fluoride and calcium
carbonates is of importance in controlling the groundwater quality in
Karst area with abundant limestone present. However, little is known
about the reactivity and stability of fluoride with carbonates owning to
the lack of molecular scale characterizations. In this study, we
employed <sup>19</sup>F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
to investigate the local molecular-scale environment of fluoride after
reacted with calcite. At low F concentration (≤1mM, at pH8), we observed
a single <sup>19</sup>F NMR peak at -122 ppm; at high F concentration (≥2mM, at
pH8), the <sup>19</sup>F NMR spectra yield two peaks at -108 and -122 ppm,
respectively. This indicates two different reaction products; the -108
ppm peak could be assigned to fluorite (CaF<sub>2</sub>), whereas the other peak
at -122 ppm with FWHM of about 3 ppm were tentatively assigned to
fluoride diffused or incorporated into calcite structure, which was
further confirmed using Nano Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (NanoSIMS).
Furthermore, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)
equipped with Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) characterization
suggested the presence of a newly formed phase with distinct SAED
pattern from that of calcite. Based on these results, a pseudomorphic
replacement model can be proposed for interpreting F/calcite
interaction, which are essential to understand the surficial interaction
between anions and calcite and access the vulnerability of groundwater
in carbonated layers (e.g. Karst).

<p style=text-align:justify>Until the 1990s, human health risks of metal contaminated soils were
based on total metal concentrations; derived from toxicity values of
metals in water and not accounting for the role of the soil matrix and,
more importantly, the impact of contaminant speciation on
bioavailability. Over the past couple of decades, a concerted global
effort has investigated the bioavailability of soil metal contaminants
relative to human health risks utilizing in-vivo animal feeding studies
and corresponding in-vitro bioassays to mimic in-vivo results for
validation. Complementary to these efforts has been attempts to
determine metal speciation to understand the complexity of soil metal
bioavailability related to the form of the metal contaminant. By
demonstrating that the speciation of the metal plays a driving role in
the bioavailability of the contaminant, risk assessors have been able to
make site-specific adjustments to clean up levels that are protective of
human health while reducing the cost of remediation.

<p style=text-align:justify>This presentation will discuss past and current efforts on soil metal
bioavailability. In particular, research on in-situ immobilization that
attempts to manipulate soil chemistry to alter metal speciation into
less toxic forms will highlight before and after measures of biological
risk resulting from amending agents.

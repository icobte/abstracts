<center style=text-align:justify>A number of synchrotron-based techniques are increasingly being used to
investigate nutrients and contaminant metals in a variety of
environmental samples. The advantages of these techniques are well
known: minimal sample preparation (e.g. reduce risk of artefacts), high
lateral and spatial resolution, ability to probe the speciation of
elements <i>in situ</i>. However, until recently, synchrotron techniques have
been considered generally ‘slow’ and not particularly sensitive in
comparison with other methods providing very detailed information on a
few samples at reasonably high concentrations. This has changed. The
advent of fast and sensitive detector technologies has completely
transformed the way we approach synchrotron experiments and the
information we can obtain. For instance, traditionally, X-ray
Fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping has been used to gain an
understanding of metal distribution while X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy
(XAS) has been employed to investigate metal speciation. This latter
approach has been performed at both the ‘bulk’ and microscale; these two
approaches being complementary and providing different information.
However, in the last few years, the development of a new generation of
fast fluorescence detectors providing unprecedented rates of data
acquisitions is blurring the divide between imaging and speciation
techniques due to the developments of methods such as XANES-imaging
(X-Ray Absorption Near Edge-imaging). Furthermore, fast detectors have
allowed us to probe not just larger samples and more samples, they have
also decreased the risk of beam damage and <i>in-vivo</i>, time series
experiments are now possible. At the same time, the development of ever
more sensitive detectors and higher fluxes have enabled the analyses of
trace element distribution and speciation at concentrations that are
environmentally relevant. In this presentation we will discuss how new
technologies have changed the information we can obtain from synchrotron
experiments, how their design has changed over time and will also
briefly discuss what fourth-generation synchrotron sources will enable
us to do.

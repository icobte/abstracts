<center style=text-align:justify>Understanding the kinetics of coupled reactions of ions on soil
particles (eg., adsorption/desorption and redox reactions) is crucial
for predicting the dynamic behavior of contaminants in soil
environments. Organic matter (OM) has abundant heterogeneous sites
controlling the kinetic reactions of cations. Iron (Fe) oxides are among
the most important mineral adsorbents to control the reactivity and fate
of both cation and oxyanion contaminants, while manganese (Mn) oxides
exhibit high reactivity with redox sensitive elements such as arsenic
(As). Furthermore, the dynamic interactions between OM and minerals play
a key role in controlling the fate of carbon (C) and metals/metalloids.
Currently, there is still a lack of mechanistic and quantitative
understanding on the role of soil binding sites and coupled reactions in
controlling the kinetic behavior of ions in soil. In this talk, we will
first describe the development of the unified kinetics model for both
cation and oxyanion adsorption/desorption on OM and Fe oxides based on
chemical speciation models including WHAM and CD-MUSIC model. The key
idea of our model is to constrain the adsorption and desorption rate
coefficients for each specific binding site and the variations of
adsorption or desorption rate coefficients among different binding
sites. We quantitatively demonstrated how the equilibrium binding of
cations and oxyanions with various soil binding sites affected the
adsorption and desorption rates. We will also introduce the development
of the quantitative models for the coupled kinetics of oxyanions
adsorption/desorption/oxidation on MnO<sub>2</sub>. Then we will focus on our
recent studies on the dynamic interactions between OM and minerals and
how they affected the kinetic behavior of metals/metalloids. We studied
the kinetic processes, at nano and even sub-nano scales, by
time-resolved chemical imaging with spherical aberration corrected
scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-STEM) equipped with
energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss
spectroscopy (EELS). Our experimental and modeling results demonstrated
that the rates of metal/metalloid speciation changes within Fe minerals
were coupled with Fe mineral transformation rates. The results help to
elucidate the dynamic behavior of C and metals/metalloids during the Fe
minerals transformation processes, and also shed lights on nano-scale
mechanisms of OM interactions with Fe oxides, which is essential to
accurately predict bioavailability and accessibility of contaminants and
OM. Our research contributes to developing comprehensive models for
predicting the kinetic behavior of metals/metalloids and OM in soil
environments.

<center style=text-align:justify>Selenium is an essential element for humans and animals at low
concentrations, while at slightly higher concentrations it is toxic.
Whether Se is toxic or essential for plants has yet to be established.
Plants are the main nutritional source of Se for humans and animals, and
their Se content depends on the bioavailability of Se within the soil
environment. An understanding of Se transformations and transport
processes, is, thus, essential for assessing the bioavailability of Se
in the environment.

<center style=text-align:justify>Adsorption/desorption of Se by soils has been identified as an important
mechanism controlling Se levels in soil solution and natural waters.
Whether or not precipitation/dissolution reactions are a mechanism that
controls Se bioavailability is still not clear. Aluminum is ubiquitous
in mineral soils, and through chemical weathering it is undergoes
hydrolysis, forming Al precipitates. The conditions under which Al-Se
minerals and noncrystalline Al-Se precipitates form is incomplete.

<center style=text-align:justify>Al-Se precipitates were prepared by adjusting the pH of
Al(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>-SeO<sub>3</sub> and Al(ClO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>-SeO<sub>4</sub> solutions to 3.5, 4.5,
5.5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5. The pH was periodically maintained for 1 year,
after which the precipitates were filtered, washed with water and
freeze-dried. The precipitates were characterized by X-ray diffraction,
FTIR spectroscopy, solid state <sup>27</sup>Al NMR, X-ray absorption spectroscopy
(Al and O K-edges, Se L-edge) and chemical methods. The study showed
that both noncrystalline and crystalline Al-Se materials can form under
ambient conditions and that the pH of the system was the overlying
controlling factor. The results indicate that precipitation/dissolution
reactions under the pH range prevailing in soil environments can control
the Se concentration in soil solutions.

<p style=text-align:justify>Biogeochemical interfacial associations and processes, are crucial for
many environmental and earth systems, including soils, sediments,
biominerals, biofilms. In this context, associations of organo-mineral
and microbial-mineral, involving organic and biologic materials and clay
minerals and Fe- and Al-(hydr)oxides, and redox processes of Fe and
other active metals, such as Mn, Ni, Cu, are highly entangled and
interrelated. Their highly heterogeneous nature in physics, chemistry,
structure and biology makes it very challenging to be fully
characterized and understood. Synchrotron soft X-rays based
spectromicroscopies, specifically the scanning transmission X-ray
microscopy (STXM) and its technique and method developments, coupled
with the X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure (XANES) spectroscopy, are
well equipped to perform multi-element chemical speciation and
quantitative chemical imaging in 2D and 3D, identification of organic
and inorganic components and their associations, and spatial correlation
analysis of elements, at high spatial resolution (10 to 30 nm) and high
spectral resolution (&lt; 0.05 eV). In this presentation,
spatially-resolved multi-element chemical analysis of selected
environmental and earth samples with respect to biogeochemical
interfacial associations and processes using STXM will be presented. In
addition, recent STXM instrumentation developments, such as XRF-STXM, in
vivo 3D STXM, will also be covered to show the strong capabilities and
potentials of STXM characterizations.

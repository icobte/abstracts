<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) poses a double threat to global food security by lowering
rice yields and directly impacting human health via consumption of
As-contaminated grain. The flooded soil conditions under which most rice
is grown facilitate As mobilization through reductive dissolution of
As-bearing Fe (oxyhydr)oxide minerals. This released As can be
re-adsorbed by soil minerals including Fe plaque, methylated by soil
microbes, or taken up by rice roots and eventually transported to grain.
The fate of arsenic in the rice rhizosphere and plant depends upon the
interplay of these controlling factors, which may change with agronomic
conditions. Here, we couple conventional and advanced spectroscopic
techniques to elucidate As(III) uptake at root tips and lateral root
junctions, and show how changes in Si availability affect root Fe plaque
mineralogy, and As speciation and localization <i>in planta</i>. These
processes occurring at the soil-plant interface will be discussed in the
larger context of global food security.

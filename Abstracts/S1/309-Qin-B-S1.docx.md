<center style=text-align:justify>Microbial extracellular electron transfer (EET) is an important driving
force for biogeochemical cycling of elements in soil. Electron mediators
can stimulate the biofilm formation of <i>Shewanella</i> MR-1 so that
enhanced the EET process. However, the way mediators influence the
biofilm formation in a soil system is still unknown. Bioelectrochemical
system (BES) is a promising technic to examine the in situ dynamics of
EET by directly recording the microbial current generation. Hence, the
effect of mediator was investigated in a soil BES, using 50 Î¼M of
9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (AQS) as electron mediator. Results
show that current generation was increased by AQS, implying an enhanced
EET rate. The biofilm biomass, as indicated by the total protein
extracted from the electrode, also increased. AQS changed the biofilm
microbial community. 16s rDNA results show that <i>Geobacter</i> has the
highest proportion in the system without AQS, while it substantially
decreased in the system with AQS. Chao1 index increased in the system
with AQS, suggesting that AQS promoted the microbial diversity. This
change of community probably has contribution to the enhancing of
biofilm formation. In summary, a new technic of soil BES was constructed
in this study, and it demonstrated that AQS has the ability to enhance
the EET process in a soil system via stimulating biofilm formation and
changing microbial community.

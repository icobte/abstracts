<p style=text-align:justify>Thallium (Tl) is a highly toxic trace element and listed as one of the
USEPA priority pollutants. Although Tl(I) is highly toxic, its fate in
soil has not been well understood. In soil environments, adsorption and
desorption reactions predominately determine the mobility and
availability of contaminants in soils. To understand the underlying
mechanisms of Tl adsorption/desorption of soils, this study performed
Tl(I) adsorption and desorption experiments on two groups of soil
samples (i.e., permanent-charge and pH-dependent-charge soils), which
have different mineralogical and physicochemical properties. The
experimental results show that Tl(I) adsorption capacities of
permanent-charge soils were higher than those of the pH-dependent-charge
soils. The ratios of Tl(I) adsorption maximum to the corresponding
cation exchange capacity (CEC) were determined to be 16 to 32% for
pH-dependent-charge soils and up to 76% for permanent-charge soils. The
results of Tl L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES)
spectra suggest that the overall Tl(I) adsorption was mainly attributed
to clay minerals including vermiculite, illite and smectite.
Subsequently, the adsorption/desorption isotherms of each soil were
fitted to Freundlich equation to evaluate the tendency of desorption as
well as to calculate the hysteresis index. The permanent-charge soils
exhibited greater degrees of the hysteresis effect in comparison to the
pH-dependent-charge soils, indicating greater Tl mobility and
availability of the pH-dependent-charge soils. To authorsâ€™ best
knowledge, this is the first time that adsorption and desorption of
Tl(I) were both investigated on soils. The results revealed the
relatively high mobility of Tl(I) in soils, implying a high
environmental risk of Tl(I) in soils.

<p style=text-align:justify>Soil contamination by heavy metals in China is one of the serious
environmental problems, and molecular-level understanding the
interaction mechanisms of heavy metal with soils facilitate our precise
management of contaminated sites. Organo-mineral complexes, as one of
the significant soil components, widely distributed in the soil systems,
and the interaction mechanisms of heavy metals with organo-mineral
complexes remains unclear due to their complexity and heterogeneity. In
this study, batch experiments were conducted and multiple
synchrotron-based hard and soft X-ray techniques (XRF, XAS, STXM etc.)
were applied to characterize the microstructures of organo-mineral
complexes, synthesized from model systems and fractionated from
agricultural soils, and the distribution and molecular speciation of
their associated heavy metals under the micro- and sub-micro spatial
scales. We found the significant impact of soil organic matter on the
binding mechanisms of heavy metals with organo-mineral complexes, which
depends critically on the contents and molecular structures of soil
organic matter. This study provides new insights into the interactions
mechanisms of heavy metals with soils, which benefits our comprehensive
understanding of the environmental behaviors and availability of heavy
metals in contaminated soils.

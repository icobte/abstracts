<p style=text-align:justify>The formation of trace metal rich minerals in soils is one pathway by
which contaminants can be removed from the soil solution to inhibit
further metal transport. The newly formed precipitates are important for
remediation efforts of contaminated soils and in the modeling of natural
geochemical cycling in sediments. Trace metal rich layered double
hydroxides (LDHs) serve as an environmentally important example in
contaminated soils, and they also have a variety of applications in
materials science. Their formation in soils occurs at the mineral-water
interface, can be kinetically rapid, and the reaction products can have
solubility product constants lower than pure metal hydroxides. Though,
there are few kinetic data obtained in real-time and at the molecular
scale which identify precipitate formation. Our objective is to
determine in real-time and at the molecular scale the kinetics and
speciation of nickel (Ni) sorption on aluminium (Al)-rich clay minerals
utilizing Quick-EXAFS spectroscopy. We hypothesized that LDHs would form
in less than several hours in a phyllosilicate mineral system using a
custom-built flow cell. Additionally, we employed wavelet transformation
(WT) to help distinguish between LDH phases and single metal hydroxide
phases. Using WT we provide evidence that nitrate or carbonate groups
may remain adsorbed to the hydroxide interlayer, and those groups may
appear as lighter backscattering components in the EXAFS spectra,
producing a similar effect as Al in the WT plot. We report real-time
<p style=text-align:justify>Quick-EXAFS data which illustrate the rapid formation of Ni-Al LDH
precipitates at the phyllosilicate mineral–water interface in a flow
environment in as little as 31–40 min. These real-time data enhance our
understanding of the kinetics of mineral–water interface processes, such
as adsorption, dissolution, and precipitation, by illustrating their
rapid and simultaneous occurrence in a dynamic environment and showing
that precipitation and adsorption can occur on the same rapid timescale.

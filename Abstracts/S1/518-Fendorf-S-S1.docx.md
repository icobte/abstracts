<center style=text-align:justify>Professor Donald L. Sparks is far more than a preeminent scholar. He is
selfless, dedicated, innovative, and a consummate statesman. His
advising and mentoring are truly remarkable and may be best illustrated
by the statistics of his former students and post-docs. Prof. Sparks has
graduated more than 65 Ph.D. students and mentored 30+ post-docs. Of his
students and post-docs, more than 20 are faculty members, 5 are leaders
in the industrial community, and 3 others are renown
senior/distinguished scientists at national laboratories.

<center style=text-align:justify>His research has contributed widely and deeply to our understanding of
processes related to environmental quality, and his record illustrates
both his productivity and impact: 3 books, 12 edited books and nearly
one-hundred volumes of <i>Advances in Agronomy</i> (a leading monogram in
soil and agriculture), ~60 book chapters, and ~250 research papers
having &gt;10,000 citations (discounting his books and book chapters).His research program is recognized as one of the World’s finest in soil
science. Further, his text books have been instrumental in advancing
soil and environmental science at both the graduate and undergraduate
levels. In his early work, Prof. Sparks was one of the pioneers of
chemical kinetics, illuminating and quantifying the rapid rate of ion
adsorption on mineral surfaces. He help bring spectroscopic means for
defining the speciation and reaction networks of metal ions to the
environmental sciences. He has made seminal contributions in
neoformation of heavy metal bearing clays, identifying a novel mechanism
by which metal ions promote clay mineral dissolution and formation of
metal hosting layer double hydroxides. Further, his group has
demonstrated the use of micro-spectroscopic approaches for
characterizing metal speciation and phase identification in soils, and
most recently helped to elucidate the complexity of soil organic matter
as layered assemblages on mineral surfaces.

<center style=text-align:justify>Beyond his research and advising/mentoring, Prof. Sparks’ is a prominent leader in the scientific community, playing a vital role in several societies. He has served as president for both the Soil Science Society
of America (SSSA) and the International Union of Soil Scientist (IUSS).
Given his national and international leadership, coupled with his
scholarship, he was asked to lead the U.S. National Academy of Science’s
standing committee on Soil Science. He has also played an important role
within the American Society of Agronomy, the American Geophysical Union,
and the American Chemical Society. Moreover, he has been transformative
at the University of Delaware, having arguably built a department and
now the Environmental Institute, which he presently directs.

<center style=text-align:justify>His accomplishments, humble demeanor, and tireless work in scholarly
pursuits and scientific advancement are awe-inspiring. Having graduate
from his program more than 26 years ago, one of my greatest privileges
is to call him my friend and mentor.

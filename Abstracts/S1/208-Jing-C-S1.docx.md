<p style=text-align:justify>Contamination by trace elements including arsenic (As) is a pressing
environmental issue that causes serious threat to human health. The
presence of As has been well documented in multiple environmental
matrices including groundwater, soil and sediment, and foods. The
toxicity and mobility of As depend on its speciation. The need for rapid
and sensitive field As speciation analysis has motivated great research
efforts for decades.

<p style=text-align:justify>Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a rapid and ultrasensitive
spectroscopic technique in chemical analysis, taking advantage of the
explosive growth in nanofabrication. Herein, we present a portable SERS
sensor for on site monitoring of arsenic speciation. Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>@Ag
core-shell magnetic NPs, which are capable of fast preconcentration,
rapid separation, and high SERS sensitivity, were used as a reliable
SERS substrate for determination of As(III) and As(V). The entire
process can be completed within 2 min. Moreover, the active SERS
substrate can be used for As sensing in complex media such as juice,
wine, and soils.

<p style=text-align:justify>The electromagnetic (EM) mechanism and short-range chemical (CT) effect
simultaneously contribute to the overall SERS enhancement. The former
does not involve the formation of chemical bonds between the analyte and
the substrate, and thus the Raman bands do not shift significantly. In
the CT mechanism the Raman peaks are selectively enhanced when excited
by different laser lines. Moreover, the CT mechanism depends sensitively
on the particular chemical bonds between the analyte and the substrate,
resulting in shifts in peak positions. The magnetic SERS platform
provides a robust and versatile approach in rapid detection of multiple
trace elements in the field using a portable Raman spectrometer.

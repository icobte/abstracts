<p style=text-align:justify>Layer-type Mn oxides are common minerals in soils. They greatly
influence the fate of trace elements through the high sorption capacity.
Synchrotron-based experimental techniques have provided molecular-level
insights into the sorption phenomena. However, the relationship between
structure and chemical reactivity remains ambiguous as little variation
in the structural and chemical composition exhibits significant changes
in the reactivity. Molecular modeling is essential to reduce the
ambiguity. Indeed first-principle calculations based on density
functional theory (DFT) have resolved many ambiguities in the metal
sorption mechanisms, in particular, related to Mn(IV) vacancies.
Nevertheless, the dynamic features of interlayer structures are
challenging to explore with DFT only. Classical molecular dynamic (MD)
simulations using interatomic pair potentials is an alternative method
to examine the dynamic features. This talk introduces a newly developed
set of pair-potentials for classical MD simulations that can deal with
more realistic Mn oxide models. MD simulation results are presented as
to the relationship among the interlayer cation/water content and
structures and the Mn octahedral sheet stacking modes.

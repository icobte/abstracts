<p style=text-align:justify>ineralogical processes in soils and sediments provide an important
control on trace metal abundance and distribution in natural and
contaminated environments, and can ultimately govern whether soils and
sediments act as a sink or a source of trace metals to surrounding
waters. In particular, despite their relatively low abundance, iron and
manganese minerals can provide a first order control on trace metal
cycling, through coupled sorption and redox reactions. These
interactions at the mineral-water interface are well known to strongly
influence metal speciation and isotopic composition, and also metal
concentration and distribution between the solid and aqueous components
of soil and sediment systems. The effect of soil and sediment diagenesis
on the mineral-water interface however, is less well known, and it is
unclear how the aging and transformation of iron and manganese minerals
influences the mobiity and ultimate fate of metals in soil and sediment
systems. Here we use a combination of advanced, high resolution
analytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy and
X-ray absorption spectroscopy and microscopy, coupled with laboratory
sorption and isotope fractionation experiments, to investigate the
reactivity and cycling of trace metals in the terrestrial and marine
environments, focusing on the sorption and diagenetic processes that
control metal cycling between soils and sediments and associated waters.
We will exemplify our work with case studies focusing on the contrasting
behaviour of nickel and cobalt in soils and sediments during sorption to
and diagenesis of managense oxide minerals. We will focus on the
processes that control the initial sequestration of these metals into
their host mineral phases and the subsequent alteration of the primary
host phases during soil and sediment diagenesis. We will show that a
combination of molecular level mineralogical processes occurring during
metal sequestration and diagenesis provide a first order control on the
global cycling of nickel and cobalt in the terrestrial and marine
environments.

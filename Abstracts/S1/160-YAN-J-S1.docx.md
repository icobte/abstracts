<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) has long been recognized as a serious health threat to
humans. With 7% of the Chinese soil samples exceeding soil environmental
quality limits, Cd is the most prevalent heavy metal contaminant in
Chinese soils according to a recent report. Cadmium is also an important
contaminant in food crops e.g. rice, especially in southern China. As a
staple food, rice is a major source of Cd intake for large numbers of
people in China. Environmental factors including redox and soil pH can
change Cd availability in paddy soils greatly and hence impact rice Cd
absorption. To understand the impacts of flooding duration and soil
amendments on Cd speciation and release kinetics in paddy soils, a
series of soil incubation experiments were performed. The soil samples
used in this study were collected from Hunan Province, China (total Cd
concentration 2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, pH 5.8). All soil samples were spiked with
CdCl<sub>2</sub> to achieve a final concentration of 165 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to ensure the
collection of high quality Cd extended x-ray absorption fine structure
(EXAFS) data. Three g CaCO<sub>3</sub> and 1 g CaSO<sub>4</sub> were added individually
and in combination. The soil samples were aged for 4 weeks, and then
incubated under moisture conditions for another 2 weeks before use.
Soils were flooded for 1, 7, 30 or 120 days in reaction columns, drained
to field moisture capacity and then immediately collected or cultured
for another 5 days and prepared for further analysis. A stirred-flow
kinetic method was conducted to determine desorption of Cd from
different soil samples. Synchrotron-based techniques and linear
combination fitting (LCF) were employed to identify and characterize Cd
speciation in the soil samples. The results show that increasing
flooding duration and using amendments both decreased the maximum amount
of Cd desorption and the rate coefficient significantly. LCF of bulk
EXAFS spectra of different samples indicated that most of the Cd was
sorbed on minerals, while an increasing amount of CdS was found as the
flooding duration increased. Furthermore, high and low Cd rice cultivars
were grown in a pot experiment with the two amendments used in the soil
incubation experiment. The results show that both CaCO<sub>3</sub> and CaSO<sub>4</sub>
treatments lowered the Cd concentration in rice shoot and grain, with
more reduction with CaCO<sub>3</sub>. These findings will aid in developing
practical ways to reduce Cd accumulation in rice.

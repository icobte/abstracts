<center style=text-align:justify>Manganese (Mn) oxides are metal scavengers and strong oxidizers. These
minerals influence fate and transport of trace metals and degrade
organic carbon and pollutants. Birnessite is the most common and
reactive one among about 30 Mn oxide phases in the environment. It is a
layered structure and layers consist of predominantly Mn<sup>IV</sup>O<sub>6</sub> with
minor Mn<sup>III</sup>O<sub>6</sub> and structural defects (Mn vacancies). The vacancies
and edges of the layers are the adsorption sites for transition and
heavy metals. The Mn(III) content in the layers affects oxidizing
activity of birnessite. Thus, the structure and Mn oxidation state
composition of birnessite strongly affects birnessite reactivity, and is
subject to dynamic changes during Mn(II) oxidative precipitation or
partial reductive dissolution that commonly occurs in natural waters,
soils and sediments. In this presentation, I will give an owv22ww1rview

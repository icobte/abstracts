<center style=text-align:justify>Mercury (Hg) is one of the most concerning pollutants at the global
scale. It is persistent, highly volatile and is able to convert into
methylmercury (MeHg), a strong human neurotoxic. MeHg is mainly released
in the environment by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and is then
biomagnified and bioaccumulated in the aquatic food web. Understanding
the biotransformation processes of Hg by these microorganisms is thus a
key for risk assessment in ecosystems and human health.

<center style=text-align:justify>Despite the discovery of genes <i>hgcA</i> and <i>hgcB</i> involved in bacterial
Hg methylation, the way Hg is taken up, methylated and released by SRB
is still unknown. Our aim is to clarify these mechanisms at the
bacterial cell level to progress in the understanding of Hg metabolic
pathways. For that, we have been studying an original SRB strain
<i>Pseudodesulfovibrio hydrargyri BerOc1</i>, able to methylate and
demethylate Hg, and the <i>Desulfovibrio alaskensis</i> G20 SRB strain, only
able to demethylate MeHg. Importantly, we used a novel approach
combining High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected – X-ray
Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (HERFD-XANES) at the Hg
L~III~-edge to speciate Hg with high sensitivity and synchrotron
nano-X-ray Fluorescence imaging (nano-XRF) to locate Hg and other
elements at the bacterial cell level. Hg methylation/demethylation rates
were also determined using multiple stable isotopic tracers (Me<sup>201</sup>Hg
and <sup>199</sup>Hg(II)) and Gaz Chromatography-ICP-MS (GC-ICP MS) after
exposure to various inorganic Hg (IHg) and MeHg concentrations (from 10
ppb to 10 ppm) and various times.

<center style=text-align:justify>Results showed that mercury methylation rates decreased with increasing
Hg concentration in contrast to MeHg demethylation, suggesting a
saturation of the Hg methylation process. HERFD-XANES identified a
tetracoordinated βHgS form as dominant Hg species for both strains
exposed to IHg while MeHg-cysteine was also detected in <i>BerOc1</i> for the
lower IHg exposure in agreement with Hg methylation rates. During the
demethylation process, various Hg- and MeHg-thiols were also identified
for both strains. These results highlight the important role of S
ligands in Hg biotransformation processes, even when bacteria are grown
in non-sulfidogenic conditions. Interestingly, nano-XRF and kinetics
studies also suggest excretion of (Hg, S)- containing biomolecules by
the bacterial cell.

<center style=text-align:justify>Composting and vermicomposting are sustainable methods to transform
organic waste materials into organic amendments providing plant
nutrients and organic carbon to soils. The carbon sequestration of both
materials may be improved by the addition of minerals and worms. The
composition of the resulting organic amendments may affect plant growth
nutrient uptake and carbon flow at the soil-root interphase. The study
of these small scale processes benefits from new analytical
developments. In the present study, we investigated (1) the effect of
different types of compost (with and without addition of clay mineral
and worms) on root and shoot biomass production of two contrasted plants
(<i>Fabaceae and Poaceae</i>) and (2) the transfer of plant-derived carbon
into different soil compartments.

<center style=text-align:justify>Our conceptual approach consisted of using continuous stable isotope
labeling and NanoSIMS analyses of the rhizospheric soil under two plant
species grown for six weeks in microcosms filled with soil amended with
contrasting organic amendments. Our results showed contrasting biomass
production depending on the type of amendment. Two samples presenting
contrasting elemental and isotopic results were selected for nano-scale
secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) analyses in order to depict
organo-mineral interactions and the incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C at the
root-soil interface. The rhizosphere represented a hotspot for
plant-derived carbon compared to bulk soil, as reflected by the higher
Î´<sup>13</sup>C values in this compartment, especially with composts and
vermicomposts produced in the presence of clay minerals. Nanoscale
analyses allowed to identify contrasting microbial functioning, which is
strongly impacting carbon and element transfer from plants to soil.

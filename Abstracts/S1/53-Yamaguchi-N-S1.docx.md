<p style=text-align:justify>Radiocesium released from Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant due to
the accident in 2011 remains in soil over northeast Japan. Most of
radiocesium was emitted from the broken nuclear reactors as soluble
forms and then strongly adsorbed on weathered micaceous minerals after
deposition on soil. However, insoluble spherical microparticles
containing radiocesium were discovered from aerosol filters collected on
March 14, 2011. Subsequently, similar insoluble Cs-bearing radioactive
microparticles (CsMPs) were found in soil, river sediment, dust, plant
tissues collected from Fukushima and surrounding areas and they were
characterized with SR-XRF/XAS or SEM/TEM/STEM by many researchers. The
main body of CsMPs is silicate glass. Analyses by SR-XRF revealed that
CsMPs contained fission products such as Cs, Sn, Mo, Te and U. The
spherical CsMPs concentrate 0.1 to 3 Bq of radiocesium in the particles
of a few microns in diameter and have stronger radioactivity than clay
minerals contaminated by soluble radiocesium. The fate of CsMPs in the
environment is not well-understood. Since silicate glass is slowly
dissolved in water, CsMP is expected to disappear from the environment
at some point in future. The purpose of this study is to investigate how
CsMPs are modified in the environment by weathering. We compared shape
and structure in CsMPs before and after dissolution in water by
SEM/TEM/STEM. We also estimated the dissolution rate of CsMPs in water.

<p style=text-align:justify>CsMPs were collected from non-woven cloth (NWC) that had covered the
fields in Fukushima when radiocesium was deposited in March 2011. CsMPs
were isolated from the other unrelated particles and observed by
SEM-EDS. After observation, CsMPs were immersed in ion-exchange water at
120, 90 and 60 °C until their radiocesium activity became around a half
by dissolution. CsMP after the dissolution treatment was observed by
SEM-EDS again and then also observed by STEM-EDS after being thinned so
as to be electron-transparent using an FIB system. We also observed
CsMPs captured by dust filters collected from Fukushima in 2015.

<p style=text-align:justify>Before the dissolution treatment, CsMPs had a spherical shape. After
dissolution treatment in water, the forms of CsMPs were considerably
altered from spherules, suggesting that the dissolution proceeded
intricately without maintaining geometric homogeneity. Tin oxide and
iron oxide nanoparticulates were formed on the surfaces of CsMPs after
dissolution. These features were consistent with a CsMP collected from
dust filters in 2015, indicating that CsMPs were not stable in the
environment but collapsed with aging. The dissolution rate of CsMPs in
water was estimated to be 0.011 µm/year at 13 °C, mean annual
temperature in Fukushima.

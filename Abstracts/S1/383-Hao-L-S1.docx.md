<center style=text-align:justify>Biofilms and microbial aggregate, which contains of organic matter,
iron/aluminum oxides, and clay minerals, are common at bulk or
microscale chemical interfaces, which all of these components bind toxic
heavy metal ions and control their fate and bioavailability in the
environment due to the high sorption capacity and binding capacity of
cells, EPS, and minerals. The spatial relationship of metal ions to
biomacromolecules such as extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) in
biofilms with microbial cells and biogenic minerals is complex and
occurs at the micro- and submicrometer scale, it also remains unclear to
which of these component(s) the metals will bind in complex microbial
aggregates and biofilm. To clarify this question, our present study
focuses on 3D mapping of heavy metals sorbed to cells, glycoconjugates
that comprise the majority of EPS constituents, and Fe(III) mineral
aggregates formed by the phototrophic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria
<i>Rhodobacter ferrooxidans</i> SW2 using confocal laser scanning microscopy
in combination with metal-specific fluorophores. To evaluate the
influence of glycoconjugates, microbial cell surfaces, and (biogenic)
Fe(III) minerals, and the availability of ferrous and ferric iron on
heavy metal sorption. To provide detailed knowledge on the spatial
distribution of metal ions in the microbial aggregates at the sub-lm
scale, which is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of
microbe–mineral–metal interactions. Statistical analysis revealed that
all heavy metals tested showed relatively similar sorption behaviour
that was affected by the presence of sorbed ferrous and ferric iron. Our
results showed that in addition to the mineral surfaces, both bacterial
cell surfaces and the glycoconjugates provided most of sorption sites
for heavy metals. Simultaneously, ferrous and ferric iron ions competed
with the heavy metals for sorption sites on the organic compounds. In
summary, we have developed and applied highly selective and sensitive
metal fluorescent probes for confocal laser scanning microscopy for
mapping heavy metals in environmental biofilms and cell-EPS-mineral
aggregates; the information obtained by the present approach using a
microbial model system provides important information to better
understand the interactions between heavy metals and biofilms, and
microbial formed Fe(III) minerals and heavy metals in complex natural
environments. The benefit of using metal fluorescent dyes in combination
with CLSM imaging over other techniques such as electron microscopy is
that environmental samples can be analysed in their natural hydrated
state, avoiding artifacts such as aggregation from drying that is
necessary for analytical electron microscopy. Correlation analysis of
spatially resolved heavy metal distributions with EPS and biogenic
minerals in their natural hydrated state will further our understanding
of the behaviour of metals in environmental systems.

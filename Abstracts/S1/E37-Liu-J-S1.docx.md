<p style=text-align:justify>Thallium (Tl) is a trace metal with very high toxicity. As a part of an
ongoing environmental investigation of copper (Cu) metallurgy impacts,
thirty sediment samples of a previously dated sediment core retrieved
from a heavily polluted urban lake (SE China) were analyzed to quantify
the pollution of Tl and identify Tl transfer mechanism within the
catchment. The results show that the lake has experienced serious Tl
pollution during the past 60 years, owing to a large influx of
<p style=text-align:justify>Tl-bearing wastes from a Cu smelter nearby. The distribution pattern of
Tl contents in the sediment core correlated well with the production
scale of Cu smelting activities. Further analysis by electronic
microscopy and X-ray diffraction suggested that Tl was found mainly
bound to quartz and alumino-phyllosilicates in both electrostatic dust
of the Cu smelter and representative highly-polluted sediments from the
depth profile. In addition, SEM-EDS analysis implied that a fraction of
<p style=text-align:justify>Tl was also frequently present in diatom frustules of the sediments. It
indicates a potentially significant role of biogenic silicates on Tl
transferring in the sediment-water system. This is the first study to
verify the coupling between Tl pollution in the lake sediments and Cu
metallurgy activities from an urban lake in recent decades. The results
also highlight the necessity of further environmental monitoring and
regulations of Tl pollution in other similar scenarios susceptibly
impacted by Cu smelting activities.

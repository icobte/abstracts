<center style=text-align:justify>FASTOSH is a new standalone program to process X-ray Absorption Fine
 Structure (XAFS) spectroscopy data. It should be particularly useful
 for geochemical and environmental applications where the XAFS
 technique is employed. Imported functions from Larch allow normalizing
 XAFS spectra and conveniently background-subtracting EXAFS scans
 collected with a step-by-step or rapid continuous acquisition mode.
 The code enables beam line users to follow in real-time the progress
 of their acquisition by automatically displaying in 2 or 3D the XANES
 or EXAFS spectra collected including the merge and progressive
 improvement of its signal-to-noise ratio. It also proposes an
 interactive background-subtraction tool for Multi-Channel Analyzer
 (MCA) patterns collected by multi-pixel fluorescence detectors. This
 can help minimize, in the XAFS spectrum extracted from MCA patterns,
 distortions due to acquisition artefacts such as diffraction
 phenomenon arising from well-crystalline solid or frozen liquid
 samples. Additionally, the code features auto-deglitching options, and
 a PCA/Target Transformation module that can instantaneously process a
 large library of XAFS spectra. It also proposes a tool to post-treat
 data processed by the MCR-ALS Matlab Toolbox of Jaumot et al. This
 enables to calculate an amplitude correction factor that allows
 comparing the EXAFS spectra of the extracted pure phases with those
 corresponding to references [4]. This study showcases the
 functionalities of FASTOSH. It also demonstrates how a combination of
 Target Transformation and MCR-ALS approaches can be helpful in
 identifying the chemical forms of lead (Pb) present in polluted soils.

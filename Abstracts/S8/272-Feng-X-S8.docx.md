<p style="text-align:justify">Mercury (Hg) isotopic compositions in hair and dietary sources from
Wanshan (WS) Hg mining area, Guiyang (GY) urban area, and Changshun (CS)
rural area were determined to identify the major Hg exposure sources of
local residents. Rice and vegetables displayed low δ202Hg and small
negative to zero Δ<sup>199</sup>Hg, and are isotopically distinguishable from
fish which showed relatively higher δ<sup>202</sup>Hg and positive Δ<sup>199</sup>Hg.
Distinct isotopic signatures were also observed for human hair from the
three areas. Shifts of 2 to 3‰ in δ<sup>202</sup>Hg between hair and dietary
sources confirmed mass dependent fractionation of Hg isotopes occurs
during metabolic processes. Near zero Δ<sup>199</sup>Hg of hair from WS and CS
suggested rice is the major exposure source. Positive Δ<sup>199</sup>Hg of hair
from GY was likely caused by consumption of fish. A binary mixing model
based on Δ<sup>199</sup>Hg showed that rice and fish consumption accounted for
59% and 41% of dietary Hg source for GY residents, respectively, whereas
rice is the major source for WS and CS residents. A compound-specific
stable isotope analysis (CSIA) of MeHg was performed on rice samples
collected in the Wanshan mercury mining area. Distinct Hg isotope
signatures were observed between IHg and MeHg in rice samples (in
mean±standard deviation: δ<sup>202</sup>HgIHg at −2.30‰±0.49‰, Δ<sup>199</sup>HgIHg at
−0.08‰±0.04‰, n=7; δ<sup>202</sup>HgMeHg at −0.80‰±0.25‰, Δ<sup>199</sup>HgMeHg at
0.08‰±0.04‰, n=7). Using a binary mixing model, it is estimated that
atmospheric Hg contributed 31%±16% of IHg and 17%±11% of THg in the rice
samples and the IHg in soil caused by past mining activities contributed
to the remaining Hg. This study demonstrated that Hg stable isotopes are
good tracers of human exposure and Hg pollution in rice.

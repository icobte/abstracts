<p style="text-align:justify">Mercury (Hg) is mobilized from the Earth’s crust and accumulates as
monomethylmercury (CH<sub>3</sub>Hg-X, where X is e.g. Cl<sup>-</sup> or R-S<sup>-</sup>) in
aquatic food webs, thereby posing a threat to human and wildlife health.
This has motivated over 50 years of research on Hg biogeochemistry.
Still, our understanding of the processes controlling the amount of
monomethylmercury available for bioaccumulation remains limited. In this
talk, I will review recent advances in our mechanistic understanding of
formation and degradation of methylated species in natural environments.
In addition, I will discuss the role of chemical Hg speciation for Hg
methylation and demethylation. Special attention will be given to our
understanding of Hg biogeochemistry in coastal and marine systems. The
understanding of Hg cycling in marine environments is particularly
incomplete even though marine harvested food is the primary
monomethylmercury exposure route for most human populations. A unique
feature of marine systems compared to freshwater systems is that
~30-80% of the total methylated Hg pool occurs as dimethylmercury
((CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Hg). The vertical and geographical distribution of mono- and
dimethylmercury have been documented in many coastal and oceanographic
systems since the 90´s. More recent work has also quantified in situ
transformation rates between chemical Hg forms (e.g. methylation and
demethylation rates of monomethylmercury). However, what role <i>in situ</i>
methylation and demethylation of mono- and dimethylmercury plays for the
amount of monomethylmercury available for bioaccumulation is unknown.
Finally, I will discuss critical questions remaining to be addressed and
constraints with experimentally based studies conducted.

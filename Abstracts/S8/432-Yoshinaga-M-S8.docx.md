<p style="text-align:justify">The metalloid arsenic is the most pervasive environmental toxin and
carcinogen, creating severe human health issues world-wide. Massive
amounts of methylarsenicals such as monosodium methylarsenate [MSMA or
MAs(V)] and aromatic arsenicals such as roxarsone
[4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylarsenate, Rox(V)] have been utilized as
herbicides and growth promoters for animal husbandry, respectively.
Those pentavalent organoarsenicals gradually degrade into more toxic and
mobile inorganic arsenite [As(III)], which leads environmental
pollutions. We previously identified a novel aerobic MAs(V) degradation
pathway composed of two steps, reduction of MAs(V) to trivalent
MAs(III), followed by demethylation of MAs(III) to As(III). These two
reactions are catalyzed by different bacteria. We further identified
<i>arsI</i>, the gene that encodes the ArsI C-As lyase, a novel MAs(III)
demethylase. In this study we show that the legume symbiont
<i>Sinorhizobium meliloti</i> Rm1021 reduces both MAs(V) and pentavalent
synthetic aromatic arsenicals. <i>S. meliloti</i> first reduces the nitro
group of Rox(V) to an amino group, forming
4-hydroxy-3-aminophenylarsenate [HAPAs(V)], and subsequently reduces
the arsenate group of HAPAs(V), forming HAPAs(III). A mixed culture of
<i>S. meliloti</i> and the soil isolate <i>Streptomyces sp.</i> MD1 with a
chromosomal <i>arsI</i> gene could degrade either MAs(V) or Rox(V) into
As(III). We propose that aerobic microbial communities can degrade
synthetic aromatic arsenicals such as Rox(V) by a multiple-step
degradation pathway of sequential reduction and ArsI-catalyzed C-As bond
cleavage, similar to the pathway of demethylation of the herbicide MSMA.
To identify the gene responsible for reduction of the nitro group of
Rox(V), we BLAST-searched the genome of <i>S. meliloti</i> for homologs of
nitroreductases and found several candidate genes. Those genes were
cloned, heterologously expressed in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and examined for
Rox(V) nitroreductase activity. One candidate termed <i>mdaB</i> (modulator
of drug activity_B), which encodes an ortholog of bacterial
FAD-NADPH-dependent nitroreductases, exhibited roxarsone nitroreductase
activity when expressed in cells of <i>E. coli</i>. Purified <i>S. meliloti</i>
MdaB reduces Rox(V) to HAPAs(V) in the presence of FAD and NADPH. These
results suggest involvement of <i>mdaB</i> in reduction of the nitro group of
roxarsone by <i>S. meliloti</i>. Identification of the gene(s) responsible
for the second arsenate reduction process [HAPAs[V] to HAPAs(III)]
is currently in progress. Supported by NIH grants GM55425 to BPR, and by

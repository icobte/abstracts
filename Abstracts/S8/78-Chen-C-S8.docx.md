<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid that is present ubiquitously in the
environment. Due to mining and smelting, arsenic contamination is
widespread in some paddy fields in southern China. Also, in these areas
human are exposed to As mainly through rice. When paddy soils are
flooded, the mobility of As and the capacity of As methylation are
enhanced casuing dimethylarsenate (DMAs) to accumulate in the soil
solution. However, DMAs can also be demethylated or volatilized by
microbes. Demethylation and volatilization of DMAs from paddy soils were
investigated in the present study. First, we incubated three paddy soils
collected from different areas in China under flooded condition. During
incubation, DMAs was produced in first two weeks and then disappeared.
The addition of 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES), a specific inhibitor of
methanogens, significantly decreased the abundance of methanogens and
retarded the disappearence of DMAs. When exogenous DMAs was added to the
three paddy soils, DMAs was demethylated into monomethylarsenic (MMAs)
and inorganic As, which was inhibited by BES. Methanogens enrichment
cultures were established from the three soils under anaerobic
conditions. The enrichment cultures were able transform DMAs to As(III)
and monomethylarsenate (MMAs). We synthesized <sup>13</sup>C-DMAs using two
enzymes in vitro, and added <sup>13</sup>C-DMAs into the paddy soils. After
incubated for 14 and 40 days, <sup>13</sup>CH<sub>4</sub> was detected in the headspace.
These results indicate that methanogens play a major part in arsenic
demethylation from DMAs. Secondly, we determined As volatilization from
DMAs(V) added to two paddy soils. The addition of molybdate, a specific
inhibitor of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), greatly enhanced
dimethylarsine (DMAs(III)H) evolution from DMAs(V). Molybdate addition
significantly shifted the microbial community structure in two paddy
soils. Aslo, a strain <i>Bacillus</i> sp. CZ-2 capable of ruducing DMAs(V) to
DMAs(III)H was isolted from the soil used, and its volatilization
ability was enhanced by Mo. This bacterial strain could not methylate
As(III) or MAs(V). RNA-seq analysis identified 10 reductase genes
upregulated by Mo in <i>Bacillus</i> sp. CZ-2, which may be involved in the
reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III)H. Our results show that DMAs(III)H
evolution from DMAs(V) is independent of the As methylation pathway, and
that Mo enhances DMAs(III)H evolution from paddy soils by shifting the
microbial community structure and enhancing the reduction of DMAs(V) to
DMAs(III)H, possibly through upregulating the expression of DMAs(V)
reductase gene(s).

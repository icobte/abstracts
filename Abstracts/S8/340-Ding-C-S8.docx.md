<p style="text-align:justify">The understanding of the methylation process was important for the
management of paddy soils contaminated by mercury (Hg). The dynamic
characteristics and the equilibrium time of methylmercury (MeHg)
production in paddy soils were still poorly understood. Predictive
models of MeHg production is necessary to demonstrate the major
controlling factors and the extent of Hg methylation in paddy soils.
Samples of eighteen paddy soils with varying soil properties were spiked
with inorganic mercury and subjected to a 90d flooding period in this
work. Soil pH and Eh were measured in situ at intervals and soils were
sampled for the analysis of MeHg. The methylation rate of mercury
increased with flooding time and reached to a relatively steady state at
30d of incubation with range from 0.08% to 2.52%, and was significantly
correlated with the in situ soil pH and Eh. The elovich equation could
well describe the kinetic production of MeHg. The MeHg production could
be well predicted by the in situ soil pH and Eh of the flooded soils, as
well as the content of organic matter of air-dried soil samples and
flooding time. The two predictive models explained 78% and 68% of the
variability respectively. The results suggested that the methylation of
inorganic mercury in paddy soils after flooding can be predicted as a
function of routinely-measured soil properties and flooding time. The
results in the present study provided insight into the extent and
equilibrium time of MeHg production and the associated risk assessment
of Hg contaminated paddy soils.

<p style="text-align:justify">Mercury (Hg) pollution in soils and sediments receives considerable
concern because Hg, especially its methylated form methylHg (MeHg), can
be readily accumulated by plants, threatening the health of consumers.
Knowledge regarding the mechanism of mobilization and methylation of Hg
in soils is fundamental to manage the risk of this metal, particularly
in paddy soils. Seasonal flooding of paddy fields leads to frequent
changes of redox potential (E<sub>H</sub>), and drives series of biogeochemical
reactions, thereby affecting the Hg mobilization and methylation.
Therefore, we aim to investigate the mobilization and methylation of Hg
in a polluted soil under dynamic redox conditions using an advanced
automated biogeochemical microcosm system. The experiment was conducted
under stepwise variation from reducing (around −380 mV) to oxidizing
conditions (around +310 mV). The soil suspensions were regularly
collected from the microcosm at the defined E<sub>H</sub> windows (-300 mV, -200
mV, -100 mV, 0 mV, +100 mV, +200 mV, +300 mV), subsequently centrifuged,
and filtrated (separated into dissolved and colloid phases). The
filtrated samples were analyzed for total Hg (THg), MeHg, dissolved
organic carbon (DOC), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), sulphate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup>),
and chloride (Cl<sup>−</sup>). The colloidal phase was collected for TEM-EDX
analysis. The sediment-phase was analyzed for Fe K-edge X-ray near edge
structure (XANES) spectroscopy, MeHg, phyto-available Hg, and for
microbial communities.

<p style="text-align:justify">The increase of redox potential caused an increase of soil pH. Dissolved
concentrations of THg, MeHg, Fe, Mn, DOC, and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2−</sup> increased under
reducing conditions, while Cl<sup>-</sup> increased under oxic conditions. The
increase of THg concentration under reducing acidic conditions might be
due to the reductive/acidic dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides, by which the
sorbed Hg might be mobilized. The increase of MeHg concentration at low
E<sub>H</sub> indicates an enhanced Hg methylation, likely due to the presence of
Hg-methylation microorganisms such as <i>Desulfitobacterium</i>, as
demonstrated by 16S rRNA sequences analysis. Also, the higher THg
concentration might provide more inorganic Hg substrate for microbial
methylation. The ln(MeHg/THg) ratio (Hg methylation potential) indicates
the net production of MeHg normalized to total dissolved Hg (THg)
concentration. This ratio increases with rising DOC to THg ratio
(ln(DOC/THg) ratio) (R<sup>2</sup>=0.59, P &lt; 0.01), while decreases with
ln(Cl<sup>-</sup>)(R<sup>2</sup>=0.66, P &lt; 0.01). The colloidal concentration of MeHg
and THg increased under moderately oxic and oxic conditions,
respectively, which might be due to the colloid particles formed at high
pH adsorbed Hg or MeHg in soil suspension. The colloidal phase consisted
of Fe, Mn, Mg, Al, and Si aggregates, as characterized by TEM-EDX
analysis. The Fe K-edge XANES analysis for the sediment phase showed
that the dissolution of Ferrihydrite occurred at reducing conditions,
confirming the mobilization of Fe oxides. Our results conclude that the
redox potential changes affect the mobilization and methylation of Hg
through related changes in DOC, Cl-, Fe, and Mn, as well as microbial
community structures. This knowledge may be helpful for managing the
risk of Hg in soil.

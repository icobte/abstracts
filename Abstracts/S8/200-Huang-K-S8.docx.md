<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic (As) biomethylation is an important component of the As
biogeochemical cycle that can influence As toxicity and mobility in the
environment. Biomethylation of As is catalyzed by the enzyme arsenite
(As(III)) <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM). To date, all
identified ArsM orthologs with As(III) methylation activities have four
conserved cysteine residues, which are thought to be essential for
As(III) methylation. Here, we isolated an As(III)-methylating bacterium,
<i>Bacillus</i> sp. CX-1, and identified a gene encoding a
<i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine methyltranserase termed BlArsM with low sequence
similarities (â‰¤ 39%) to other ArsMs. BlArsM has six cysteine residues
(Cys10, Cys11, Cys145, Cys193, Cys195 and Cys268), three of which
(Cys10, Cys145 and Cys195) align with conserved cysteine residues found
in most ArsMs. <i>BlarsM</i> is constitutively expressed in <i>Bacillus</i> sp.
CX-1. Heterologous expression of <i>BlarsM</i> conferred As(III) resistance.
Purified BlArsM methylated both As(III) and methylarsenite (MAs(III)),
with a final product of dimethylarsenate (DMAs(V)). When all six
cysteines were individually altered to serine residues, only C145S and
C195S derivatives lost the ability to methylate As(III) and MAs(III).
The derivative C10S/C11S/C193S/C268S was still active. These results
suggest that BlArsM is a novel As(III) <i>S</i>-adenosylmethionine
methyltransferase requiring only two conserved cysteine residues. A
model of As(III) methylation by BlArsM is proposed.

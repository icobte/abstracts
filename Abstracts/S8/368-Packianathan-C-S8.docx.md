<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic is the most ubiquitous environmental toxic substance. Arsenic is
ubiquitous in water, soil and food and ranks first on the Environmental
Protection Agency's Superfund Priority List of Hazardous Substances.
Arsenic(III) S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) methyltransferase (AS3MT in
animals and ArsM in microbes) is one of the key enzymes in arsenic
biotransformations, catalyzing the methylation of inorganic arsenite to
methyl, dimethyl and trimethyl products. As(III) methyltransferases are
found in members of every kingdom, from bacteria to humans (EC
2.1.1.137). In the human liver, hAS3MT converts inorganic arsenic into
more the toxic and carcinogenic methylated species. We have determined
the X-ray crystal structures of CmArsM from the thermophilic eukaryotic
alga <i>Cyanidioschyzon merolae</i> and CrArsM from the eukaryotic green alga
<i>Chlamydomonas</i> <i>reinhardtii.</i> These two ArsMs are orthologs of hAS3MT.
Analysis of their structures in various ligand-bound forms allowed us to
develop a new hypothesis for catalysis involving a disulfide bond
cascade. A homology model of hAS3MT was built on the structure of CmArsM
with bound PhAs(III) (PDB ID: 4KW7). Interestingly, the model of human
AS3MT has a cleft between the N-terminal and C- terminal domain that we
propose is an allosteric site that controls the activity of AS3MT. We
docked small molecules available in the NIH database with the hAS3MT
model and found that they bind in the proposed allosteric site,
consistent with a role for that site in regulating AS3MT catalysis.

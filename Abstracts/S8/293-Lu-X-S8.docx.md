<p style="text-align:justify">Microbial conversion of inorganic mercury [Hg(II)] to organometallic
methylmercury (MeHg) is a global concern because MeHg is a neurotoxin
and can bioaccumulate and biomagnify to high levels. Here we use
<i>Desulfovibrio desulfuricans</i> ND132 as a model bacterium to examine the
roles of divalent metal ions on Hg(II) uptake and
methylation. The
presence of a small amount of copper ions [Cu(II), &lt;100 nM]
enhances Hg(II) uptake and methylation by washed cells of ND132, while
Hg(II) methylation is inhibited at higher
Cu(II) concentrations due to copper toxicity to the microorganism.
The enhancement or inhibitory effect of Cu(II)
is both time and Cu concentration dependent: The presence of nanomolar
concentrations of Cu(II) facilitates rapid uptake of Hg(II) (within
minutes) and doubles MeHg production within a 24 h period, but
micromolar concentrations of Cu(II) completely inhibit Hg(II)
methylation. The Cu(II)-enhanced Hg(II) uptake and methylation are
highly specific and not observed with divalent metal ions such as
Zn(II), Ni(II), Mg(II), and Mn(II) under the same experimental
conditions. These observations suggest a synergistic effect of Cu(II) on
Hg(II) uptake and methylation, possibly facilitated by copper transporters or metallochaperones in this organism, and
highlight that complex environmental factors affect MeHg production in
the environment.

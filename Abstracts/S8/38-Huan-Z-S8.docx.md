<p style="text-align:justify">Recent studies indicate elevated methylmercury (MMHg) production and
bioaccumulation in soil-rice systems, raising health concerns. However,
mechanistic understanding about key factors controlling Hg methylation
and thus risk of MMHg in rice paddy fields are lacking. We explored the
controls of key factors on Hg methylation and bioaccumulation in
contaminated soil-rice systems: (1) Rice straw amendment could largely
enhance Hg methylation in paddy soils and thus MMHg accumulation in rice
plants; (2) Biochar amendment would largely reduce phytoavailability and
thus bioaccumulation of MMHg (49â€“92% in rice grain), while enhance Hg
methylation in soils; (3) Se amendment into soils could significantly
reduce Hg methylation in soils, by forming refractory Hg-Se complexes
(XANES analysis), which in turn reduced MMHg accumulation in rice
plants. In contrast, Se accumulation in plants could have minor effects
on reducing MMHg accumulation in rice; (4) Humus-coated clay could
largely decrease Hg bioavailability; (5) Bioavailability of inorganic
mercury (IHg) and MMHg decreased sharply within short period of Hg-soil
contact (2-28 days), while the reduction was more evident in soils with
lower organic content. The effects of those key factors on Hg
methylation and bioaccumulation, as well as the mechanistic explanation,
improve our understanding about Hg dynamics and risk in contaminated
soil-rice systems.

<p style="text-align:justify">PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution has become one of the most severe environmental
problems in China in recent decades, and caused a wide range of health
issues. For health-oriented air pollution control, it is vital to rank
the contribution of different emission sources according to the health
risks posed by hazardous components in PM<sub>2.5</sub>, such as trace metals. In
this study, we investigated the variations of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-associated metals
from March 2016 to February 2017 in two densely populated regions of
China - the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD)
across urban-suburban-rural gradients. The major emission sources of
metals were evaluated by the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model,
and quantitatively apportioned to the health risks on the basis of the
concentrations of bioaccessible metals extracted by simulated lung
fluids. The results showed that the particulate trace metal profiles
reflected the land-use gradient within each region, with the highest
concentrations of anthropogenically enriched metal (e.g., Cu, Pb, As,
Cd, and Zn) at the suburban-industrial site of the YRD and at the
semirural-industrial site of the PRD due to the urban and industrial
activities. The estimated pulmonary bioavailability of trace elements
was generally high for As, Mn and V (&gt;60%), moderate for Co, Ni, Cu
and Cd (20%-60%), and low for Fe, Zn, and Pb (&lt;20%). The resulting
carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic health risks posed by these elements
were around 1.4 times higher in the YRD than in the PRD region. Arsenic
was the dominant contributor to the total excessive cancer risks of
these elements in both regions. Non-traffic combustion
(coal/biomass/waste) was the dominant contributing source of metal-posed
cancer and non-cancer risks in both regions, except for traffic emission
as the largest contributor in the suburban-industrial site in the YRD.
Our comprehensive analysis of two key regions in China provided
region-specific insights into the health risks of PM<sub>2.5</sub>-associated
trace metals in linkage to their major emission sources.

<p style="text-align:justify">Though the fact that whether selenium (Se) is an essential element for
rice plants is not confirmed now, many previous studies focused on the
characteristics of Se accumulation in common rice grains through
application of Se fertilizers to soil. To further understand the quality
of Se in the Se-enriched rice cultivars, a Se-accumulating rice cultivar
(Fengbazhan) cultivated in red soil treated by selenite at levels of 0,
0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg Se kg<sup>-1</sup> in this study. The Se speciation in
grains and the bioaccessible Se species were determined by the high
performance liquid chromatography-hydride generation-atomic fluorescence
spectrometry (HPLC-HG-AFS), and the bioaccessibility of grain Se using
an in-vitro simulation model was also analyzed. The results showed that
Se in rice grains mainly existed in the organic forms, which accounted
for more than 60% (61.7-69.6%) of the total Se but no significant
differences were detected between the different treatments (<i>P</i> &gt;
0.05). Concentrations of the glutelin-derived Se, as the dominated
organic forms, were 116.4 ± 13.5, 243.3 ± 17.7, 579.7 ± 105.3, and
1904.0 ± 51.7 μg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively under the soil Se treatments,
accounting for 24.0%, 24.4%, 29.3%, and 30.7%, respectively of the total
Se in grains, which was sightly increasing with the soil Se levels. The
bioaccessibility of Se in grains were 54.3%, 51.1%, 57.0% and 68.1%,
respectively for the Se treatments of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>.
The speciation analysis results showed that selenomethionine (SeMet), as
the main bioaccessible Se species, accounted for 31.6%, 40.0%, 40.4% and
58.2%, respectively, and the inorganic species, selenite, also accounted
for approximately 10% of the total bioaccessible Se in grains. The
gastrointestinal simulated results indicated that though the
bioaccessible SeMet percentages in grains increased with the Se
treatments and more than half of the grain Se could be bioaccessible for
human beings, there was still a considerable amount of bioaccessible Se
species needed to be identified. In conclusion, the application of
selenite in soil can slightly increase the accumulation of
glutelin-derived Se in rice grains and the bioaccessible SeMet, which
are very important for human health. Additionally, for the Se-enriched
rice cultivars, fractions of the organic Se in grain and the
bioaccessible Se are still not very high. Thus, the transformation and
migration of exogenous selenite in soil-plant system should be further
studied, and next we will investigate the non-glutelin-derived Se in
rice grains and identify those unknown bioaccessible Se species.

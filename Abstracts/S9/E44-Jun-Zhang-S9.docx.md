<p style=text-align:justify><strong>Abstract:</strong> Arsenic (As) is a carcinogen that is widely distributed in
the environment. Phyllosphere of duckweeds in paddy soil environments is
a hotspot in arsenite (As(III)) oxidation which may have a substantial
impact on As biogeochemistry in water environments. Previous work has
shown that As(III) oxidizing bacterial communities in the phyllosphere
of duckweeds were dominated by <i>Rhodobacter</i> species. In this study,
<i>Rhodobacter</i> strain CZR27 that exhibited the ability to oxidize As(III)
was isolated from the phyllosphere of duckweeds using an anaerobic
phototrophic enrichment culture method. CZR27 is highly resistant to
arsenate (As(V)), but more sensitive to As(III). Bioinformatic analysis
revealed that CZR27 has three As resistance operons and an As(III)
oxidase gene cluster. The As-resistance and As(III) oxidation ability by
strain CZR27 and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Oxidation
of As(III) by the strain under anoxic phototrophic conditions coincided
with bacterial expression of <i>aioA</i>, indicating participation of the
gene in the As(III) oxidation process. Expression of <i>ars</i> genes after
exposure to As(III) and As(V) was analyzed. Both As(III) and As(V) were
effective inducers. There was no detection of As(III) in cell cultures
incubated with As(V), and the genes to reduce As(V) were absent in the
CZR27 genome, which indicates that nonenzymatic reduction of As(V) may
provide sufficient As(III) for low-level induction of <i>ars</i> genes in
strain CZR27. The results indicate that strain CZR27 has As-responsive
genes that confer resistance to both As(III) and As(V). Quantitative PCR
of <i>aioA</i> revealed the presence of As(III)-oxidizing bacteria in the
phyllosphere of duckweeds. The abundance of CZR27 revealed by
quantification of the genome-specific gene was significantly larger in
the phyllosphere of duckweeds than other niches in the paddy soils. The
prevelance of a specific bacterium in the phyllosphere of duckweeds may
be useful for efficient and sustainable bioremediation of
As-contaminated water.

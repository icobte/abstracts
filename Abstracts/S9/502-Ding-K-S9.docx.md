<p style="text-align:justify">Natural metal-bearing nanoparticles (MNPs) are of concern due to their
higher mobility, potential toxicity, and the severe soil contamination
in China. MNPs was usually found in contaminated environments, such as
contaminated river water and soil. However, the types of MNPs from
contaminated agricultural soils in China and their metal speciation were
still unknown, which are important information for soil contamination
prevention and remediation. We assumed that 1) the types of MNPs were
relevant to the geographical location and 2) the metal speciation
depended on the MNPs types. 105 samples from contaminated agricultural
soils across China were collected, and MNPs were therefore extracted
from these samples. The elemental compositions were determined by
inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES) and
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). MNPs
categorization was achieved by cluster analysis and principal component
analysis. Associations of metal contaminants with inorganic minerals and
organic matter were further analyzed by Asymmetric flow field-flow
fractionation (AF4) coupled with online UV-vis detector, dynamic light
scattering detector, organic carbon-detector, and ICPMS. Morphology and
mineralogical characteristics of MNPs were observed by Transmission
electron microscope coupled with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
(TEM-EDS) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Elemental
concentrations of MNPs exhibited regional characteristics that 1) Fe and
Mn were enriched in MNPs from southeast China; 2) Ca and Mg were
enriched in MNPs from southwest China; 3) Cu was enriched in MNPs from
copper ore mining areas; and 4) Pb and Cd were enriched in MNPs from
lead-zinc ore mining areas. All the MNPs samples were categorized into
four types based on their elemental proportions: Type Ca, Type
Ca-Si/Al/Fe, Type Si, and Type Si/Al/Fe. Two kinds of MNPs existed in
all samples and defined as Ca-organic nanoparticle and Si-Al-Fe-organic
nanoparticles according to the AF4-OCD and AF4-ICPMS results.
Furthermore, Pb and As were
more likely to associate with Si-Al-Fe-organic nanoparticles, while Zn,
Cu, and Cd were likely to
associate with both organic-Ca nanoparticles and Si-Al-Fe-organic
nanoparticles. The regional characteristics and speciation of MNPs
provide significantly important information for soil contamination in
perspective of nanoparticle biogeochemistry.

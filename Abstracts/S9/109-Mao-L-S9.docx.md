<p style="text-align:justify">Geochemical lability of trace metals in sediments is crucial for
accurate environmental risk assessment. In periodically flooded
sediments, the complicated reactions among sediment components induced
by changing REDOX conditions and the limitation in analytical methods
make it difficult to quantify the metal lability or to identify the
dominant factor that controls the lability. We proposed a modified
isotopic dilution method, which measures metal lability (known as the
‘E-value’) with minor disturbance of REDOX potential (Eh) during the
experimental process. Contaminated sediments with different organic
matter contents (OM%) were incubated in laboratory under reducing
conditions (by adding N<sub>2</sub>), and the fluctuation of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn
lability (E%=E-value/total concentration) were illustrated in response
to the reducing Eh. The E<sub>Cd</sub>% fluctuated the most among all four
metals: from +90mV to -45mV, the E<sub>Cd</sub>% decreased by 22%; then elevated
by 23% before the Eh reached -135mV; and finally decreased sharply by
21% till Eh=-165 mV. For Cu, Zn and Pb, the similar pattern of E%
fluctuation implies that the controlling mechanism are the same for
these 3 metals at different stages of decreasing Eh. The combined effect
of metal release from mineral oxides, sorption on solid organic matter
and complexation with dissolved organic matter leads to an intermittent
increase in E% for these 3 metals in the Eh range from 90mV to -135mV.
Sharp decrease in E% was observed for all metals in anoxic condition as
a consequence of precipitation of stable metal sulphides. Cd lability in
sediments with lower OM% is more ‘sensitive’ to the reducing condition
than that in higher OM% sediment. With initial E<sub>Cd</sub>%=46% in oxic
condition, the value reached up to &gt;94% in the range of 0mV to -50mV.
In contrast, the effect from OM% was much less significant for Cu, Zn
and Pb when the Eh decreased from 120 mV to -70 mV. According to this
study, during the flooding period, the environment may experience
highest risk from toxic trace metals in sediments when it reaches
suboxic condition. The risk diminishes when it becomes anoxic as the
formation of sulphide minerals can largely reduce the lability. Among
all 4 metals, Cd should be given more attention especially in sediments
with low OM content. The modified isotopic dilution method is suggested
for future investigation on the influence from other sediment
components, e.g. Fe and Mn oxides, carbonates, etc. on trace metal
lability under altered REDOX conditions.

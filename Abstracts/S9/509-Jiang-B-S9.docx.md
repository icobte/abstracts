<p style="text-align:justify">Definition of heavy metal phytotoxicity in contaminated soils is
important in adopting an official method for the assessment of
contaminated soils. Dose-response relationships explain how the response
changes as exposure dose changes. However, the results of tests or
observations are commonly based on total concentration of heavy metals
in environments, not the exposure dose that causes toxicity. The total
concentration as a regulatory criterion to assess the toxicity of heavy
metals in soils, but ignored the mobile and available distinction among
different heavy metal sources. In the present study, the copper (Cu)
phytotoxicity to barley root elongation was studied in 17 representative
Chinese soils. Also, the EDTA-extractable Cu concentration was applied
to evaluate Cu extractability, after which the relationships between
EDTA-extractable Cu and total Cu concentration in different soils were
established. The concentrations of EDTA-extractable Cu accounted for
89.6â€“91.2% of total added Cu in 17 Chinese soils. The multiple linear
regressions using soil pH, organic carbon content (OC) and cation
exchange capacity (CEC) were found to explain over 85% of the variance
in Cu phytotoxicity thresholds based on EDTA-extractable concentration.
The EDTA-extractable Cu dose-toxicity relationships incorporating soil
properties were then derived by regression analysis. Soil properties
(soil pH, OC, CEC and oxalate extractable Mn) and EDTA-extractable Cu
concentration explained more than 90% of the variance in the toxicity
response of barley root elongation. The new dose-toxicity relationships
could be used to develop a reasonable remediation strategy for
contaminated soils.

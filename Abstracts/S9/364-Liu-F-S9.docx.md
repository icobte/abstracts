<p style="text-align:justify">Metal complexation has long been implicated as a dominant control on the
bioavailability of trace metals to aquatic organisms, and metal uptake
is best predicted by the free metal ion concentration in the exposure
medium. However, low-molecular-weight (LMW) weak ligands such as
cysteine have been shown to enhance metal uptake in the presence of
strong ligands by marine phytoplankton, but the effect is not observed
in freshwater. We hypothesize that these contrasting results are due to
the large differences in ambient Ca concentrations and metal-ligand
exchange kinetics between marine and freshwaters; specifically, free
metal ions newly liberated from LMW-metal complexes in the boundary
layer surrounding algal cells (phycosphere) cannot be immediately
sequestered in seawater by the metal buffer (which is largely bound to
Ca or Mg), but can be rapidly complexed in fresh waters where free or
protonated forms of the metal buffer are more available. In the present
work, short-term Cd uptake experiments at different Ca concentrations
with a model freshwater alga (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) and a marine
alga (<i>Thalassiosira weissflogii</i>) consistently support our proposed
hypothesis. At constant concentrations of bulk Cd<sup>2+</sup> buffered by a
strong ligand: 1) in artificial freshwater with addition of seawater
levels of Ca, Cd uptake by high-Ca pre-acclimated <i>C. reinhardtii</i>
cultured with cysteine as the N source (to enhance local Cd<sup>2+</sup>
liberation via cysteine degradation) in the presence of cysteine was
2.2-fold higher than that in the absence of cysteine; 2) in the
artificial freshwater but at a low Ca concentration, the enhancement was
not observed in cysteine-acclimated <i>C. reinhardtii</i>; 3) at seawater
levels of Ca, the enhancement disappeared as well when the high-Ca
pre-acclimated <i>C. reinhardtii</i> were cultured with ammonium as the N
source (to inhibit cysteine degradation and local Cd<sup>2+</sup> liberation);
and 4) in artificial seawater, when the total concentration of
free/protonated strong ligand was higher than that of the Cd-cysteine
complexes, the Cd uptake rate by <i>T. weissflogii</i> that had been cultured
with cysteine did not change after addition of cysteine. These results
suggest that the phycosphere effect could potentially increase metal
toxicity or improve nutrition of essential trace metals such as Fe, Zn
and Cu, neither of which can be predicted solely on the basis of the
chemistry of the ambient bulk water.

<p style="text-align:justify">The present study was emphasized to evaluate the pollutant levels of the
sediments of Yundang Lagoon, at Western Xiamen Bay, Xiamen, China.
Xiamen island is one of the most rapid developing and urbanizing cities
in China. Bottom surface sediments of 18 locations of Yundang Lagoon
including inlet channel, outlet channel and upstream lakes were
collected to evaluate the contamination, spatial distribution, risk and
possible sources of heavy metals including Chromium (Cr), Manganese
(Mn), Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd)
and Lead (Pb). The total concentration of metals in sediments were
ranged from 43.78 to 82.38 µg/g for Cr, from 300.32 to 1237.32 µg/g for
Mn, from 18.51 to 40.91 µg/g for Ni, from 27.34 to 116.46 µg/g for Cu,
from 129.98 to 832.64 µg/g for Zn, from 5.58 to 19.62 µg/g for As, from
0.62 to 3.29 µg/g for Cd and from 40.42 to 83.52 µg/g for Pb
respectively. The metals concentration was spatially varied in this
Lagoon and maximum concentrations were observed in the upstream lakes
(S3) and downstream of the outlet channel (S18). Therefore, minimum
metals concentrations were found mostly in the inlet channel (S13, S14)
of the Lagoon. In comparison with the marine sediment quality
(GB18668-2002, China), it has demonstrated that average concentrations
of Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu were higher than class I level of sediment marine
quality. And, maximum concentration of Cd, Zn and Cu (Upstream lakes and
downstream sampling areas) were higher than class II marine sediment
quality level. In addition, maximum concentrations of all metals were
higher than the world average shale concentration. The Geo-accumulation
indices of Cr, Mn, Ni and As indicate no contamination of these metals,
but Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb showed moderate to high contamination levels.
Overall, the mixture of metals contamination degree (C<sub>d</sub>) indicates all
the metals were moderate to considerable degree pollution of this
Lagoon. The potential ecological risk (E<sup>r</sup><sub>i</sub>) showed a low potential
risk for Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, and Pb in all sampling areas and Cd
showed low to considerable ecological risk in the studied areas. Pearson
correlation and principal component analysis suggest that Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb
TOC were originated from the same anthropogenic sources. Strom water,
industrial discharge, domestic sewerage, runoff, combustion of gasoline,
boat riding were the important sources to import heavy metals in the
Yundang lagoon. Overall, to reduce to pollution level, remediation
strategy should be implemented according to the contamination level of
different areas.

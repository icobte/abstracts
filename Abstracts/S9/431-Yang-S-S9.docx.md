<p style="text-align:justify">A comprehensive and source-oriented risk analysis of metal accumulations
in agriculture soils is critical for managing prior pollutant source to
alleviate health risks. In this study, an integrated approach linking
these three modules (source apportionment, exposure assessment and
health risk characterization) was developed to capture the
source-oriented health risks of soil heavy metals from a former
electronic waste (e-waste) recycling center in China. Results found that
concentrations of Cd (0.03-9.20 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and Cu (17.77-1122.87 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>) were elevated above the safety threshold. Parent materials and
pesticides, fertilizes application, industrial discharge and traffic emission
accounted for 46.6, 22.2, and 31.2%, respectively, of the metal
accumulations. The total
non-cancer risks from total three pollutant sources for both groups
exceeded the guideline value of 1 by 7-12 folds and the total cancer
risk were also 8-28 times higher than the maximum acceptable level of
1E-04, indicating that high health risk induced by soil heavy metal
contamination. Among three sources, parent materials and pesticides,
fertilizes application was the largest contributor (52.9%) to total
non-cancer risks. Despite the industrial discharge contributed the least
to metal concentrations, it contributed the most to the total cancer
risks (45.3%). Target reduction of industrial discharge through
accelerating technology upgrade, strengthening emission standard and
lengthening safety distance limits of site selection are critical for
minimizing the heavy metal input to agriculture soils and preventing
potential health hazard. Coupling source apportionment and exposure risk
assessment model provided more effective implication for contamination
mitigation strategies to address interrelationships across source, sink
and human beings.

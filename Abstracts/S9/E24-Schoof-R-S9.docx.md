<p style="text-align:justify">Increasing numbers of countries include site-specific adjustments in
health risk assessments to account for differing relative
bioavailability (RBA) of chemicals in soil. This talk will describe how
RBA is incorporated into health risk assessments and will provide an
overview of the history of development of methods for testing metal RBA
in soil. The early focus in the late 1980s was on use of animal models
to test lead and arsenic RBA, followed soon after by the development of
in vitro test systems.

<p style="text-align:justify">While animal studies have generally been considered the more reliable
predictor of RBA in humans, differences in physiology and anatomy among
animal species limit the accuracy of these models in predicting behavior
in humans. Further, variations in toxicokinetics and other factors
result in the need to apply different study designs to different metals.
In vivo methods used to assess the bioavailability of soil-borne
chemicals are typically modified versions of methods used historically
in biomedical research. These methods have been modified to address
constraints associated with use of doses relevant to environmental
concentrations, the need to reflect weathering behavior in soils over
time, and the need to generate data applicable to human health risk
assessments. Lead and arsenic provide examples of such differences with
arsenic being rapidly excreted in the urine, while lead accumulates in
bone and has a much longer half-life in the body. Due to these
differences, animal methods to calculate RBA differ for lead and
arsenic.

<p style="text-align:justify">In contrast, a number of in vitro methods now in use have been validated
by comparison with animal test results and are considered at least as
reliable as animal studies. The prevailing methods in use in Europe,
Canada, the United States and Australia will be described. Current in
vitro methods for assessing lead and arsenic will be used to illustrate
application of these models in risk assessment. Methods being applied to
other metals will also be reviewed. While research and methods
development effort has focused on evaluation of the relative
bioavailability of lead and arsenic in soil, extension of these findings
to other metals has been a subject of some debate. Factors that could
affect applicable methods for a given metal include differences in
toxicokinetics and toxic endpoints. Studies of the bioavailability of
soil Cd, Cr, Ni and Hg will be described to illustrate a range of issues
and approaches that are compared with approaches used for arsenic and
lead. Recommendations for evaluation of other metals will be provided.

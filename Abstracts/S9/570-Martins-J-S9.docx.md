<p style="text-align:justify">Soils are being extensively exposed to nanoparticles (NPs) due to their
increasing use in many commercial products. The transport mechanisms of
NPs in soil and their adverse effect of NPs microorganisms have been
reported in various eco-physico-chemical studies by using different
experimental systems, such as columns, microcosms, mesocosms or field
lysimeters. Despite the increasing environmental realism in the
experimental design, the assessment of toxic effects of NPs in soil
still suffers a lack of ecological relevance for soil exposure. It is
mainly based on acute exposures although chronic exposures are more
likely to occur. This study aims at i) characterizing the mechanisms of
NPs transport in columns of 6 highly contrasted naturel soils, ii)
assessing the influence of single and multiple applications on the
transfer of TiO 2 -NPs through an original exposure approach using soil
columns and iii) comparing the effect of single and repeated exposures
to TiO 2 -NPs in soil on the abundance and activity of soil nitrifying
microbial community. The results permitted to evidence quite contrasted
transport levels between the two types of NPs and also between soils.
The NPs mobility and impact observed on soil microorganisms were shown
to be controled by both the exposure route (concentration, dynamic
injection, time between injections) and frequency of applications
(single or repated injections). By simulating acute and chronic
exposures of soil to NPs dynamically injected, we showed that successive
applications of NPs are more damaging for the functionning soil
microbiological than an acute exposure. This highlights the importance
of considering both doses and exposure conditions for environmental risk
assessment of manufactured NPs in soil.

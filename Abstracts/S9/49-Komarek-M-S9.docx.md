<p style="text-align:justify">A generic hydrous Fe oxide surface is often used in surface complexation
modeling (SCM) for predicting metal behavior in aqueous and soil
environments. However, this approach may lead to incorrect results
because there are many different naturally-occurring Fe(III)
(oxyhydr)oxide mineral phases in the environment, each exhibiting
distinct adsorption characteristics. We provide a simple and unified
workflow for obtaining the adsorption parameters (DLM and CD-MUSIC),
which are readily implementable into widely used geochemical codes, such
as Visual MINTEQ, MINEQL+, and ORCHESTRA. The parameters were obtained
enabling quantification of metal adsorption onto a range of Fe(III)
oxides (goethite, hematite, lepidocrocite, maghemite) in various aqueous
environments. The dataset of SCM parameters characterize the adsorption
of selected divalent metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) at varying metal
concentrations and ionic strengths. In general, the CD-MUSIC model
provides better fits to the observed metal adsorption data onto the
studied Fe oxides than the simpler DLM. However, the CD-MUSIC fits were
based on more fitting parameters (multiple surface complexes,
electrostatic parameters, etc.) and the DLM approach aimed to be as
simple and consistent as possible for all the studied Fe(III) oxides and
metals. Nevertheless, both modeling approaches provide a useful and
viable option that should result in better predictions of metal
speciation in the environment than the ‘generic’ Fe oxide model.

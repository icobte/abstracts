<p style="text-align:justify">For non-essential trace elements, the concept of a “critical body
residue” or CBR has been explored over the years as a means of
predicting whether or not the element is likely to exert deleterious
effects on the host organism. However, aquatic organisms tend to
accumulate metals in different forms, some of which remain internally
bioavailable whereas others are detoxified; measures of total
bioaccumulated metal ignore this phenomenon of subcellular metal
partitioning. If the ratio of bioavailable to detoxified metal remains
constant within the organism as metal exposure increases, then use of
the CBR concept is appropriate. However, if the subcellular partitioning
of the metal varies with metal exposure, then the critical body
concentration approach no longer applies. Over the past 15+ years, we
have investigated how aquatic organisms cope when exposed to
non-essential metals such as silver, cadmium, nickel and lead. These
metals normally enter living cells by facilitated transport, “fooling”
the transmembrane transporters that are responsible for the influx of
essential metals. Once inside the cell, the non-essential metals may be
detoxified, for example by complexation with metallothionein or by
sequestration in metal-containing granules. If detoxification is
incomplete, these metals will be available to bind to metal-sensitive
sites within the cell, such as enzymes or nucleic acids, potentially
leading to deleterious effects. To determine whether metal
detoxification has been effective or not, we have employed a two-pronged
approach. The first step involves gentle cell rupture followed by
differential centrifugation and heat denaturation, yielding five or more
fractions: cellular debris; metal-rich granules; organelles; cytosol;
heat-denatured cytosolic proteins (HDP); heat-stable cytosolic proteins
(HSP). The HSP and granule-like fractions are normally considered to
represent detoxified metal, whereas the HDP and organelle (e.g.,
mitochondria) fractions are classified as metal-sensitive fractions. The
second step calls for the chromatographic separation of metal-ligand
complexes present in the operationally-defined cytosol or the HSP
fraction, to probe their chemical identity. This dual separation scheme
has been used to compare the partitioning of different metals in a given
species or of a specific metal across different species. In this
communication, we compare the subcellular behaviour of metals in
unicellular algae, an insect larva, a bivalve and several fish species.
The algae were exposed under controlled conditions in the laboratory,
whereas the animals were all collected in the field from contaminated
sites representing metal contamination gradients. In all the
field-collected animals, we were able to document a metal detoxification
response involving the induction of metallothionein-like peptides
(MTLP). Less frequently, the non-essential metal was sequestered in the
granule-like fraction. The results show predictable differences between
“soft” and “hard” cations, but for a given metal they also show
inter-organ and subtle inter-species differences in the extent of metal
detoxification. The implications of these findings for the application
of the critical body residue approach will be discussed.

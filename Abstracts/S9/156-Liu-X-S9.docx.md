<p style="text-align:justify">Elements including cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and arsenic
(As) are widely dispersed in the environment naturally or
anthropogenically by agricultural and industrial activities. Once
absorbed, they are being persistent in human body with long excretion
half lives for decades and thus classified as potentially toxic
elements. Food consumption was the main pathway for human exposure to
toxic elements compared to inhalation and dermal contact. Thus the
accumulation of toxic elements in the environment was of increasing
concern due to food safety issues and potential health risks. Wild
growing mushrooms have been consumed as a delicacy in Europe and Asia
due to their savorous taste, aroma and species heterogeneity as well as
therapeutic effect in preventing diseases such as hypertension,
hypercholesterolemia and cancer. Accessible studies concerned elements
in mushrooms from nutritional point and observed trace elements Hg, Cd
and Pb. In recent decades, statutory limits for metals in wild edible
mushrooms have been established, e.g. 0.2 and 0.3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (FW) for Cd
and Pb, 5.0, 2.0 and 10.0 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (DM) for Hg, Cd and Pb. In addition,
further elements limits were also established, 3.0, 4.0, 80, 80 and 80
mg kg<sup>-1</sup> (DM) for As, Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn, respectively. The health risks
of metals depend more on bioavailability instead of total content,
however, limited studies elucidated their health risk for humans. In
addition, limited information about speciation and distribution of
mushroom trace elements was available. Moreover, more attention was put
on cultivated mushrooms, less focus on the wild growing ones. Commonly,
element contents in mushrooms are species- and/or growing
stages-dependent, thus waiting for investigated. Therefore, the aims of
the study were to: 1) analysis elements (As, Cd, Hg, Pb and Zn) contents
in wild edible mushrooms growing in naturally high background
substrates; 2) determine trace elements content in multiple species and
changes during growing stages; 3) examine elements speciation and
distribution; and 4) propose numeric contributive information on the
proportion of element speciation from total content on bioavailability
and human health risk. The uppermost layer of 10 cm depth soil will be
sampled and analyzed for trace elements. The wild edible mushrooms of
different growth stages will analyzed for trace elements total content,
speciation, and distribution. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) will be
calculated to express the ability of mushrooms to accumulate elements
and elements soil-to-mushroom bioavailability. In vitro and in vivo
experiments will be involved to examine mushroom elements
bioavailability to human and to calculate the numeric contributive of
the proportion of element speciation from total content in
bioavailability. Basing on this, credible human risk assessment will be
proposed.

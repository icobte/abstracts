<p style="text-align:justify">Increasing evidence indicates the presence of engineered nanoparticles
in sewage sludge derived from wastewater treatment. Land application of
sewage sludge is, therefore, considered as an important pathway for ENP
transfer to the environment. The aim of this work was to understand the
effects of a sewage sludge containing nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> on plants (tomato)
when used as an amendment in agricultural soil. Ti was characterized in
soil and sludge matrices (concentration, size distribution, shape,
speciation, association with other soil particles). We, then, assessed
developmental parameters for the entire plant life cycle (4 months)
along with metabolic and bio-macromolecule changes and Ti accumulation
in plants. Both soil and sludge contained similar amount of Ti (about
800 mg/kg) but with different origins natural vs. anthropogenic. The
results obtained on plants suggest that the sewage sludge amendment
containing nano-TiO<sub>2</sub> increased plant growth (142% leaf biomass, 102 %
fruit yield), without causing dramatic changes in biochemical responses,
except for a 43% decrease in leaf tannin concentration. Changes in
elemental concentrations (mainly Fe, B, P, Na, and Mn) of plant stem,
leaves and, to a lesser extent fruits were observed. Fourier-transformed
infrared analysis showed maximum changes in plant leaves (decrease in
tannins and lignins and increase in carbohydrates) but no change in
fruits. No significant Ti enrichment was detected in tomato fruits.
Increased plant growth and elemental concentrations are likely due to
the nutrients brought by the sewage sludge. The decrease in tannin and
lignin can be a consequence of increased plant growth. In conclusion, we
evidenced no negative impacts on plants after one plant life cycle
exposure. If TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles had a negative effect, it was overcome
by the positive effect of the nutrients contained in the sewage sludge.

<p style="text-align:justify">Alga are widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems and play an important
role in arsenic (As) bioavailability and biogeochemical cycling. As one
of important freshwater algae, <i>Microcystis aeruginosa</i> have been
identified for their high heavy metal and <i>As</i> accumulation rates and
their possible usage for water treatment. Ongoing research shows the
potential of this organism for removing <i>As</i> as well as important
process parameters related of the organism for accumulation and
detoxification by means of transformation to less toxic inorganic or
methylated <i>As</i> species. Additionally, when using coagulation technology
to remove <i>As</i>-loaded algae from the water phase, there parameters
should be optimized including pH, coagulant types, arsenic levels.
Meanwhile, additional budget should be allocated to the management of
the toxic sludge produced since precipitated <i>M. aeruginosa</i> may to a
certain extent release <i>As</i> again into the water phase (in situ or ex
situ disposal). Thus, environmental safety of the coagulation technology
itself should be assessed prior to its use, which has not yet been done
so far. In particular, changes in <i>As</i> content and <i>As</i> speciation in
<i>As</i>-loaded <i>M. aeruginosa</i> were not addressed clearly after in-situ or
ex-situ disposal in water phases after algal coagulation and
precipitation. We thus investigated changes of <i>As</i> concentrations and
its species in the in-situ treated algae water by optimal coagulation
and <i>As</i> release kinetics from its subsequent living and dead
precipitated algae after ex-situ disposal. Results showed that the
optimal coagulation treatment for removing algae was 25 mg/L PACl, 1.0
µM arsenate (<i>As</i>(V)), and pH 6.0, whereby we attained greater than
99.5% algal removal efficiency. Moreover, in the in-situ treated water,
total dissolved <i>As</i> slowly decreased as standing for 6 days, but
arsenite (<i>As</i>(III)) largely increase after 3 days standing. Additionally, potential
risks arised from <i>As</i> release in short-term duration (24 h) from both
living and dead precipitated algae at 1.0 μM <i>As</i>(V) pre-exposure due to
their higher release rate constants. Similarly, <i>As</i> release in
long-term (6 d) duration from dead alga at 10.0 µM <i>As</i>(V) pre-exposure
also resulted in potential risks. Moreover, <i>As</i> release from
precipitated <i>M. aeruginosa</i> depends not only on <i>As</i> content in the
algae but also on the status – living or dead – of the algae while being
disposed ex-situ. This study offers insights into the appropriate
disposal of precipitated algae with <i>As</i>-contamination when either bloom
algae exposed <i>As</i> or being used for bioremediation of <i>As</i> contaminated
water. This study was jointly supported by Major Science and Technology

<p style="text-align:justify">The sites of historical arsenic mining and processing are often
considerably polluted with As and other potentially toxic elements,
which poses a considerable environmental risk. Organic matter supplied
to those soils as decomposing forest litter can cause mobilization of As
and other toxic elements, change their speciation in pore water and
influence the toxicity to biota. This study examined the chemistry and
ecotoxicity of pore water acquired from four soils that developed on the
dumps in former As mining sites, in the presence and absence of organic
matter introduced with forest litter collected from beech and spruce
stands. Soils that contained 1540-19600 mg/kg of As were incubated for
90 days at 70% of water holding capacity. Soil pore water was collected
four times (after 2, 7, 21 and 90 days) with MacroRhizon suction
samplers and analysed. Chemical analysis involved determination of pH,
concentrations of As and metals that had a high enrichment factor
(Igeo&gt;3): Cu and Pb, as well as other metals considered most mobile
in the environment: Cd, Zn and Mn. Ecotoxicity of pore water was
examined in three bioassays: Microtox, MARA and Phytotox with <i>Sinapis
alba</i> as test plant. The release of As, unlike heavy metals, was
particularly intensive from the soils with neutral and alkaline pH. The
results provided by Phytotox had a poor precision, but correlated well
with As concentrations in pore water, which indicates that As made a
crucial factor of phytotoxic impact on the seedlings. Similarly, the
outcomes of Microtox bioassay also indicated a relationship between As
concentrations and toxicity, however, other factors contributed to
ecotoxicity at very low and very high As concentrations, and the highest
toxicity was recorded from the soils treated with forest litter. MARA
turned out to be not sensitive enough to give reproducible results at
those concentrations of toxic elements that were present in pore water,
up to dozens mg/L. The growth of microbes in the MARA bioassay was
poorly dependent on the concentrations of As and metals in pore water
except for a yeast <i>Pichia anomala</i> the growth of which was related to
the concentrations of Cu. The results let us conclude that the bioassays
Phytotox and Microtox can provide useful information on ecotoxicity of
pore water in soils that develop on As-rich dumps whereas applicability
of MARA in those conditions proved limited.

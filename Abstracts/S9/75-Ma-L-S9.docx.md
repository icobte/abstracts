<p style="text-align:justify">Studies have shown the association between metal exposure and various
diseases in humans. Among exposure pathways, dietary intake is an
important contributor. In China, studies have shown elevated As, Cd, and
Pb concentrations in dietary staples, including rice, wheat, and
vegetable, threaten human health. Assessment of metal intake from food
consumption is important to assess the associated health risk. However,
dietary metal intake is often calculated using total concentration in
foods without considering metal bioavailability. There are limited
reports of metal bioavailability in foods, with the importance of
incorporating metal bioavailability into human exposure assessment not
being considered. In addition, the major factors that influence metal
bioavailability in food matrices have not been evaluated, which help to
develop mitigation strategies to decrease metal exposure in humans. We
collected rice, wheat, and vegetable samples from markets across China,
and from two contaminated sites of Yixing, Jiangsu and Chenzhou, Hunan.
In vivo mouse bioassays were developed and applied to measure As, Cd,
and Pb relative bioavailability (RBA) in food samples, which was
incorporated into daily metal intake estimation and compared to internal
metal exposure such as urinary and hair metals. Factors that contributed
to variation in metal bioavailability among samples were identified,
while the influences of mineral dietary supplements on metal relative
bioavailability in rice was assessed. For rice samples from markets
across China and contaminated sites, an in vivo mouse urinary As
excretion method was developed to measure As-RBA. Overall, As-RBA in
rice from both markets (44.5–87.5%, n=14) and contaminated sites
(11–65%, n=11) varied considerably, with As speciation being the
dominant contributor to the variability. As-RBA was positively
correlated with inorganic As, but negatively correlated with organic As.
To measure Cd and Pb RBA in food samples, an in vivo mouse liver and
kidney assay was developed. Similarly, Cd-RBA varied considerably in
rice (16.9–57.4%, n=10), wheat (37.4–67.6%, n=8), and vegetables
(17.7–78.0%, n=6) from the Yixing site. Also, Cd- and Pb-RBA in rice
(n=11) from the Chenzhou contaminated site were 41–84% and 11–59%. For
residents living in the Yixing site, the predicted urinary Cd based on
total Cd in rice was 3.5 times that of measured values, while
incorporating Cd-RBA to assessing rice-Cd intake made the predicted and
measured urinary Cd more closer, suggesting the importance of Cd-RBA in
controlling Cd exposure. Subsequently, we determined the effectiveness
of mineral dietary supplements to modulate Cd exposure, revealing that
Ca dietary supplement was the most effective way to decrease Cd-RBA in
rice, while high dietary intake of chloride could enhance Cd-RBA. Future
population-based intervention studies should be conducted to show the
effectiveness of dietary mineral supplement to decrease human Cd body
burden. For residents living in the Chenzhou site, As, Cd, and Pb
exposure via rice consumption was compared to that via housedust
ingestion based on RBA. Interestingly, we observed that for adults, rice
was the main As contributor, while housedust ingestion was the major As
contributor to children. However, for both adults and children, rice was
the main source for Cd exposure, while housedust was the predominant Pb
contributor. This was confirmed by overlap of stable Pb isotopic
composition between Pb in housedust and hair from residents, while Pb
signals in rice was different from housedust Pb.

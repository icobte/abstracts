<p style="text-align:justify">This study characterizes how changes in climate may alter the physical
and chemical properties and the reaction kinetics of the extraordinary
manganese soils found in Graskop, South Africa. Manganese-oxides govern
many geochemical reactions due to their abundance and high reactivity.
Despite their importance in cycling redox sensitive compounds in natural
systems, much remains unknown about the reactivity of manganese-oxides
formed under environmental conditions and how this may be altered by
changes in local climates. In order to study how these manganese-oxides
react, soils were collected from Graskop, South Africa. Three soil
profiles were excavated with a range of manganese concentrations. Each
profile was further separated based on horizons, with some of the
profiles containing over 20% manganese. Manganese nodules of various
sizes are ubiquitous in these soils. The soil in each horizon was
thoroughly characterized to determine chemical and physical properties,
including cation exchange capacity (CEC), point of zero charge (pzc),
Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, and buffering capacity. X-ray
powder diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the mineralogy of the
crystalline material found in the clay fraction. The nodules present in
the soils were also analyzed and their crystalline composition was
determined with XRD. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were
taken of each soil to characterize the particle distribution and
minerology. A series of batch reactions were used to determine the
capacity of these soils and nodules to oxidize arsenite into arsenate
under a variety of factors that may be impacted by an altered climate.
The conditions of the reaction were varied from pH 4.5, 7.2, and 9.0 and
temperatures ranged from 4.5 ˚C, 23 ˚C, and 40 ˚C to elucidate how
differing pH and temperature influenced the oxidation reaction. Aliquots
collected from these experiments were analyzed by liquid
chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS).
Solid samples from the reactions were taken to National Synchrotron
Light Source II and analyzed on beamline 4-BM to determine the changes
in manganese oxidation state after reacting with arsenite under varying
conditions. X-ray fluorescence maps were collected on thin sections of
these soil to analyze the distribution and speciation of Mn and Fe in
natural soils and nodules. This study provides key insights to more
fully understand the role of manganese-oxides in controlling redox
sensitive reactions in the present and future environment.

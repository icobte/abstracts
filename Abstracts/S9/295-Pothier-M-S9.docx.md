<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic (As) is a naturally-occurring group A carcinogen found in food,
water and soils worldwide. There is a growing body of evidence pointing
towards dissolved organic matter (DOM) as being a key player in the
control of arsenic redox state, mobility and toxicity. Yet, no known
study has directly quantified DOM effects on the fraction of arsenic
available to bacteria. Because of its demonstrated binding affinity to
As, we hypothesized that DOM serves as a strong predictor of As
bioavailability. Using an As-specific biosensor, we tested our
hypothesis by altering environmental variables affecting the affinity of
As to DOM, namely DOM photoreactivity, As-DOM complex age, ionic
strength and DOM origin selected for its sulphur content. First, in the
presence of DOM, we demonstrated that As bioavailability was affected by
DOM concentration, the age of the As-DOM complex and by the presence of
divalent cations. We showed that DOM differentially affected the
bioavailability of As(III) and As(V) and that bioavailable
concentrations of both inorganic As species were reduced by up to 83% in
the presence of environmentally relevant levels of calcium (10 mM),
likely a result of cationic bridging (As-Ca-DOM). Here, DOM aromaticity,
sulphur and carboxyl content appeared to control the extent of As
species uptake. Second, the combination of the biosensor and ICP-MS
measurements revealed that As(III) was readily photooxidized regardless
of the presence of DOM, and that changes in ionic content greatly
affected the extent of As(III) photooxidation in the presence of DOM.
Our results are the first to reveal the control that DOM exerts on
As(III) and As(V) bioavailability to bacteria. We emphasized the complex
role that DOM plays in arsenic photoreactivity and its consequences on
As bioavailability. Our work is relevant to understand the
biogeochemistry of arsenic in the context of on-going environmental
changes such as prolonged seasonal irradiation, seasonal redox
fluctuations and As cycling in ground/surface waters with high organic
matter content and high ionic strength.

<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid, widely distributed in soils, waters,
atmosphere and organisms. Arsenic contamination in groundwater is a
well-known global
environmental problem over the past 10 years. The As in groundwater is
released from soils following the development of anaerobic conditions,
and arsenite [As(III)] is the predominant As species in the reducing
environments. In many parts of the world, arsenic-contaminated
groundwater is not just used for irrigation of crops but is also widely
used for drinking water, particularly in arid regions where are often
concomitant with high alkalinity and/or salinity, causing widespread public health concern.
Microalgae are an important primary producer in aquatic systems with
great potential in bioremediation of As due to their high As removal
ability. Previous studies have demonstrated that <i>Dunaliella salina</i>, an
exceptionally halotolerant microalga, is a good candidate in arsenate
[As(V)] remediation due to its strong As(V) tolerance and As
accumulation ability. However, the detailed As(III) tolerance and metabolism, especially the
biooxidation of As(III) by <i>D. salina</i>, remain unexplored. Understanding
the inherent mechanisms of As(III) oxidation in <i>D. salina</i> is important
for maximizing the As remediation efficiency, since As(V) is much easier
to remove from water than As(III) by conventional physicochemical
methods such as adsorption, coagulation, coprecipitation, ion exchange,
and membrane separation. Therefore, we investigated As(III) oxidation
and toxicity in a marine microalga <i>D. salina</i> under different phosphate
conditions. The results of 72-h As(III) toxicity experiment showed that
<i>D. salina</i> is more sensitive to As(III) than to As(V), indicating that As(III) oxidation by
this algae was acting as a detoxification process. The oxidation of
As(III) appeared to be more effective with increased extracellular
phosphate concentrations. We found that the higher As(V) percentage in
the medium under the higher phosphate concentrations was mainly from the biooxidation by <i>D.
salina</i>, which mainly occurred on the cell surface whereas intracellular
oxidation cannot be neglected. Overall, the findings of this work not
only demonstrate that phosphate play a key role in the oxidation of
As(III) which occur both inside and outside the <i>D. salina</i> cells but
also expand our knowledge of As detoxification mechanism in this marine
alga.

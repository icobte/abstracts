<p style="text-align:justify">Global Mercury Observation System confirms that most of the mercury
emissions and re-emissions emerge from South Asia. However, there is a
lack of human health risk assessment based on mercury in this region
which is crucial to identify hotspots, develop management strategies and
to estimate the total population at risk. In this study, we present the
human health risk map from the exposure to mercury contamination in
drinking groundwater by using the probability kriging geostatistical
method for Lucknow monitoring area (1222 Km2) which is situated in the
central part of the Ganga Alluvial Plain, Northern India. Our human
health risk map contributes to the identification of potential hotspots
across all the three distinct sectors (urban, rural and combined
farming) of this diverse region. We have compiled mercury data in our
previous published study and here, we confirm that the health of the
significant population of the region is at risk due to the regular
intake of mercury-contaminated drinking water. The dissolved mercury
concentrations ranges from 9.74 to 61.42 ppb with an average value of
15.38 ppb. Risk quotients were computed by comparing exposure
concentrations with the World Health Organization guideline value (1.0
ppb) to. Additionally, we have also identified the fraction of
monitoring area at risk and estimated the health of total inhabitants
risk areas through a spatial overlay of the risk map with the area and
population data. We have discovered that the probability of exceedance
of mercury is the highest in the combined farming sector of the
monitoring area due to the presence of various anthropogenic
interferences. In the urban sector, the hotspot with high to very high
probability for health risk is located in the highest population density
regions, where 32% of the total population resides in the 7% of the
total land of the monitoring area. In Northern India, these potential
hotspots are in the Ganga Alluvial Plain that provides drinking water
resources to its habitants who account for ~7% of the world population.
Overall, we suggest that the risk from mercury exposure should be
considered as a priority by environmental risk managers as it is
affecting one of the most densely-populated and
agriculturally-productive regions of the South Asia.

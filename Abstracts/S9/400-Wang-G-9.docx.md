<p style="text-align:justify">Biological soil crusts (biocrusts) play critical roles in maintaining
soil fertility and conserving soil and water in arid and semi-arid area,
and in situ remediation that mediated by biocrusts is perhaps one of the
key process to control heavy metal(loid)s pollution in mine tailing
ponds. However, how the biocrusts regulate behaviours of heavy
metal(loid)s (i.e., Pb, As, Zn) in tailing wetlands are largely unknown.
Here we examined contents of heavy metal(loid)s in biocrusts and
suspended particles of mine tailing effluent, in order to reveal
probable relationships of heavy metal(loid)s between immobilization in
biocrusts and spatial distributions in effluent particles. Results
showed that heavy metal(loid)s were largely accumulated in biocrusts
(i.e., Pb, 0.42 g kg<sup>-1</sup>; As, 23.7 g kg<sup>-1</sup>; Zn, 11.1 g kg<sup>-1</sup>), some of
which were even significantly higher than tailing sand. Concentrations
of Pb (0.32-1.04 g kg<sup>-1</sup>), As (3.60-32.1 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) and Zn (2.36-23.2 g
kg<sup>-1</sup>) were high in fine suspended particles of tailing effluent
wherever they were distributed in the tailing wetland system, and heavy
metal(loid)s contents in effluent particle decreased significantly along
the downstream where biocrusts were also present. In addition, contents
of Fe were as high as 131 g kg<sup>-1</sup> in biocrusts, and 63.3-223 g kg<sup>-1</sup>
in effluent particles, respectively, in the neutral (6.05-7.74) system.
Overall, our study demonstrates that biocrusts have a perfect
performance on heavy metal(loid)s immobilization, and fine particles in
tailings effluent might be the foremost source of metal(loid)s in
biocrusts. This study was supported by National Key R&D Program of China

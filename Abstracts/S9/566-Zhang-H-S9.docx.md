<p style="text-align:justify">For many years it has been recognised that speciation is a key factor in
determining the bioavailability of metal pollutants in the environment.
One of the key factors that regulates the speciation, mobility and
lability of trace metal pollutants in natural waters is the
concentration and nature of organic matter. Metals may bind to dissolved
organic matter (DOM) in complexes of varying stability, or adsorb to
particulate organic matter and through sedimentation relocate to the
sediment. With the biouptake, metals may be released from their
complexes. However, understanding of the interaction, the dynamic
processes and the kinetic signature of metals and organics, including
dissolved organic carbon and biotic ligands remains incomplete. DGT
(Diffusive Gradients in Thin films) is a technique that was developed as
a robust <i>in situ</i> speciation technique to measure free metal and
inorganic and/or organic complexes which can readily dissociate. These
so called labile species include a proportion of metals bound to humic
substances. The use of a strong binding resin (Chelex) allows
pre-concentration of trace metals, confering sufficient sensitivity to
enable measurement of metals by DGT in pristine natural systems. Fluxes
measured using dynamic techniques, such DGT and voltammetry (more
conventional technique), can be affected by the distribution of species,
their transport dynamics (diffusion) and the dissociation rates of the
complexes. Unravelling this information is challenging and impossible
for voltammetry. Manipulation of the physical properties of DGT has
enabled the simultaneous derivation of kinetic and speciation
information for natural waters. Deployment of multiple DGT devices with
a range of diffusion layer thicknesses can provide directly a visually
informative kinetic signature for a range of metals, and with more
sophisticated interpretation, information on the dissociation rates of
complexes. Previous work has shown that it may be possible to understand
the kinetics of metal release from its DOC complexes using <i>in situ</i> DGT
deployments, potentially allowing assessment of the types of organic
matter present in a system. This work focuses on the investigation of
the kinetics of the interaction between metals and dissolved organic
matters produced by algae in freshwaters. For most metals the rate at
which they were released from the organic matter was fast, but release
of Al and Cu were kinetically limited. The relationship between Fe and
DOC was a defining feature of the kinetic signatures. The in situ
kinetic parameters of metal release from the organic complexes obtained
by this novel approach are essential for the future development of
dynamic models and for advancing our understanding of trace metal
bioavailability and biogeochemical processes in aquatic systems.

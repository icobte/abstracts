<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic (As) is a highly toxic environmental pollutant, it is ranking
first in the ‘Superfund List of Hazardous Substances’. However, human
activities such as mining, the burning of fossil fuels, and pesticide
application, have amplified the input of this metalloid in various
coastal ecosystems around the world. Coastal environments in close
proximity to densely populated, industrialized regions are expected to
represent the ultimate sink for TiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs) and
arsenate, which may be critical in driving coexisting pollutants
transport and likely influence bioavailability of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-As. To
date, there is only limited information available on the uptake,
bioavailability and biotransformation of As(V) associated with TiO<sub>2</sub>
NPs in organisms. To better assess the ecological impact of As(V) with
the presence of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs in coastal environments, the effect of TiO<sub>2</sub>
NPs on arsenate uptake，bioavailability and biotransformation in mussels
<i>Perna viridis</i> were investigated. Compared with previous study about
traditional contaminants associated with nanoparticles, the present
study provided a new exposure pattern to simulate the pollution status
in the actual environment: Test organisms were exposured in different
arsenate levels until reaching a steady state, subsequently, TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs
were added while maintaining the original arsenate level. The results
showed that the presence of nTiO<sub>2</sub> significantly promoted the
accumulation of As in mussels <i>Perna viridis</i> under TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs-As
exposure. The contents of As speciation demonstrated the As
biotransformation in the mussels included As(V) reduction, methylation
to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and
subsequent conversion to arsenobetaine (AB). The reduced organic species
(AB, MMA and DMA) and arsenic methyltransferases (GST) activities of
<i>Perna viridis</i> with the existence of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs suggested the
detoxification and methylated systems were inhibited. Moreover, organic
osmolytes (glycine betaine and dimethylglycine) contents and enzymes
activities were reduced after the addition of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs, resulting in a
decrease of organic osmolyte - AB proportions. The results showed that
TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs also induced the disturbance in osmoregulation of <i>Perna
viridis</i>. In summary, this study provides a new exposure pattern to
elucidated the effects of TiO<sub>2</sub> NPs on arsenate uptake, bioavailability
and metabolism in mussels <i>Perna viridis</i>.

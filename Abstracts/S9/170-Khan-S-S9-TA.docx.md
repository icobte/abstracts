<p style="text-align:justify">As some trace elements (TEs) are essential micronutrients for all living
organisms, their availability in soils is important for sustaining a
healthy ecosystem. The objective of this study was to test the
hypothesis that the intensity, duration, and frequency of soil
drying-rewetting cycles enhance leaching of TEs (Mn, Zn and Cu).

<p style="text-align:justify">We tested this hypothesis by drying a loamy grassland soil at 4
temperatures (25°C, 30°C, 35°C and 40°C) and two durations (2 or 14
days). Subsequently two replicates of each dried soil treatment plus a
moist control treatment were packed in microcosms and rewetted with
deionised water. All treatments were subjected to three re-wetting
cycles. Second and third rewetting cycles were carried out 7 days after
the first and second rewetting events, respectively. Collected leachate
was filtered (0.45µm), acidified (Aristar HNO<sub>3</sub>) and analysed for TEs,
using ICP-MS.

<p style="text-align:justify">Relative to the control moist soil (39.7 % moisture content and stored
at 3°C), the leachate concentration of all metals increased in all
drying treatments. The largest percentage metal concentration increases
occurred for the extended drying period (14 days) at 40°C. However,
smaller increases in leachate metal concentrations were observed for the
shorter drying duration (2 days) at 40°C. The observed increase in metal
leaching is perhaps caused by drying-rewetting induced aggregate
disruption, enhanced mineralisation, and microbial cell lysis. Our
results demonstrate that the intensity and duration of drying enhance
concentrations of Mn, Zn and Cu in leachates. However concentrations
diminished in the successive rewetting events probably because available
metals have been leached and those that remain were not in soluble
forms.

<p style="text-align:justify">Our results suggest that increased intensity and duration of soil drying
and frequency of successive rewetting have potential to promote leaching
of TEs and thus have implications for ecosystem health, especially under
changing climate.

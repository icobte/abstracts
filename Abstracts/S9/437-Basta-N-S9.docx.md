<p style="text-align:justify">Hazards of soil Pb to wild birds may be more accurately quantified if
the bioavailability of that Pb is known. To better understand the
bioavailability of Pb to birds, we measured blood Pb concentrations in
Japanese quail (<i>Coturnix japonica</i>) fed diets containing
Pb-contaminated soils. The in vitro bioaccessibility of Pb (IVBA Pb) in
the test soils was then measured in seven <i>in vitro</i> tests and regressed
on relative Pb bioavailability (RBA Pb) to produce predictive in vivo in
vitro correlation (IVIVC) equations. The bioaccessibility methods were:
U.S. EPA Method 1340 at pH 1.5, the same test conducted at pH 2.5, the
“Ohio State University <i>In vitro</i> Gastrointestinal” method (OSU IVG),
the “Urban Soil Bioaccessible Lead Test”(USBLT), the modified
“Physiologically Based Extraction Test” (PBET) method, the “Waterfowl
Physiologically Based Extraction Test” (W-PBET) and the Avian Ohio State
University (AOSU) method. Further studies with diet included in the in
vitro methods were performed for the U.S. EPA 1340 pH 1.5 method, the
modified U.S. EPA 1340 pH 2.5, and the AOSU. Based on criteria of slope
and coefficient of determination, the modified U.S. EPA Method 1340 pH
2.5 and OSU IVG tests performed very well for fasted (i.e., no diet
addition) conditions. The AOSU was able to accurately predict RBA Pb
(RBA Pb = 1.94 IVBA Pb -12.0, r<sup>2</sup> = 0.92). Results suggest that an
IVIVC derived from either a diet+soil or soil-alone method would yield a
predictive equation to estimate RBA Pb.

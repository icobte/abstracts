<p style="text-align:justify">In order to understand the speciation analysis and the ecological risk
of the heavy metals in the surface soil and the lake sediments of NE
China. Though the BCR (European Communities Burean of Reference)
sequential extraction all samples were put into a centrifuge tube and
using a mechanical shaker shaking for 16h (overnight)at the room
temperature. The solid residue in the extract was separated by
centrifugation for 20 min at 1500rpm, and the resultant supernatant
liquid was moved to a polyethylene volumetric flask, subsequently, the
supernatant was decanted; 8 mL of 0.11 mol/L HAC was added to the
residue, centrifuged again, decanted the supernatant, and collected the
supernatants; dilute the supernatant to 50 ml with deionized water as
the test solution, the solid residue kept for the next step. This method
can divided the PHTEs into four different types, and showed the
bioavailability. The enrichment factor (EF) and Index of geoaccumulation
(Igeo) results showed that Cd was obviously enriched in all lakes and
reached the moderate pollution level. A comparison of PHTE
concentrations in the lake sediments from 2005 to 2015 found the PHTEs
pollution status doubled. Multivariate statistical analysis identified
the heavy industries of petroleum and steel in the cities close to lakes
and excessive agricultural fertilizing in the region as possible
pollution sources of the PHTEs. The HÃ¥kanson index method (RI) showed
the risk degree of 11 lakes had reached a medium level of potential
ecological risk except for one lake which had a low potential ecological
risk status.

<p style="text-align:justify">Fish contain important polyunsaturated fatty
acids (PUFA) that are mostly obtained from their diets and subsequently
transferred to higher consumers, including humans. Mercury is taken up
by all aquatic organisms and may threaten the benefits imparted by fish.
Both mercury (Hg) and PUFA occur together in dietary sources for fish,
and both are conveyed along aquatic food webs.The eutrophic status of
aquaculture units (ponds, reservoirs) in China and elsewhere can also
impact fish Hg bioaccumulation and PUFA profiles.And the eutrophication
may lower the high-quality PUFA content in fish by changing the plankton
community composition. To assess the effect of aquaculture on the fatty
acids composition and potentially toxic mercury (Hg)content in fish, we
investigated total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg),polyunsaturated
fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic (EPA,20:5n−3) and
docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n−3) in cultured and wild fish and their
potential diets from two reservoirs in southwest China. In cultured
fish, mercury contents were lower, but EPA+DHA and omega-3 to omega-6
and (n-3/n-6) PUFA ratios were higher than in wild fish. The lower Hg
content in cultured fish was related to the lower Hg in fish feeds and
Hg bio-dilution due to the higher somatic growth mainly contributed by
the higher DHA contents in fish feeds. As assessed by highly valuable
PUFA and potentially toxic Hg contents, these results suggest that these
cultured fish had higher nutritional value than wild fish. However, the
EPA+DHA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios were lower in plankton from
aquaculture reservoirs, implying that aquaculture may change the
community structure of the pelagic food, lower the PUFA content in
plankton, and consequently reduce dietary PUFA transfer to upper trophic
levels.

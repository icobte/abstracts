<p style="text-align:justify">Thallium (Tl) is the most toxic metal of all and is present at
concentrations of concern over a wide geographical area. Tl can be
released to the environment during coal mining, processing and use in
coal-fired power plants and other coal based industrial processes, and
through refining processes of ores for other metals such as copper,
gold, lead, uranium, and zinc. For the past decades, Tl has been
developed as a tracer to investigate paleo-oceanographic processes as
well as geochemical cycles in the modern ocean. However, up to date, the
roles of biology in the Tl cycle have seldom been considered. Here we
present dose-response data from various families of phytoplankton to a
wide range of Tl concentrations (1 ng/L to 1 mg/L). Growth rates, the
maximum yield of photochemistry of photosystem II (F<sub>v</sub>/F<sub>m</sub>), the
functional absorption cross-section of photosystem II (σ<sub>PSII</sub>), and the
change of whole metallome have been analysed. Of all phytoplankton
studied here, cyanobacteria (<i>Synechococcus</i>) have the largest tolerance
to Tl toxicity, whereby growth was even stimulated at high Tl
concentration (1mg/L). Haptophytes, especially isochrysidales,
accumulated significantly more Tl intracellularly than chlorophytes.
Tl<sup>+</sup> can be mistakenly imported for the chemically similar K<sup>+</sup>.
Potassium transporters of various phytoplankton have also been
identified from their genome using a novel orothogroup inference
algorithm (OrthoFinder), and singular value decomposition (svd) analysis
of potassium transporters data provides a fundamental framework to
understand the contrasting bioaccumulation of Tl among different
lineages. The potassium transporters from <i>E. huxleyi</i> are significantly
different from all other phytoplankton in this study. Indeed, <i>E.
huxleyi</i> accumulated most Tl available in the media at enviromental
relevant concentrations (up to 100 ng/L). Based on the data in this
study, under the average Tl concentration in seawater (10 ng/L), <i>E.
huxleyi</i> can accumulate 1.6 µg Tl per g organic C produced by this
organism. <i>E. huxleyi</i> is one of the most widely distributed
phytoplankton, and considering massive yearly blooms of this species
which cover an average of 1.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> km<sup>2</sup> surface water, Tl cycles in
those area should be largely affected.

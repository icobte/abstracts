<p style="text-align:justify">The total concentration of a metal in solution or in sediments is a poor
predictor of its potential effect. In most cases, the actual effect is
not correlated with the chemically determined total metal content yet
this is the criterion that is often used for regulatory purposes. A
better estimation of effect relies on estimating metal speciation in
solution, (i.e., how metal species interact with inorganic or organic
ligands and how these species affect cellular targets); typically, this
is achieved using electrochemical methods, multicomponent thermodynamic
equilibrium speciation modelling, or a combination of both. These data
are subsequently included in models such as the Biotic Ligand Model that
is then used to predict metal toxicity. Following sequential extraction
and chemical analysis, two experimental approaches are typically used to
obtain information on the metal fraction that is bioavailable: i) uptake
assays using algae or invertebrates; and ii) the use of microbial
bioreporters.

<p style="text-align:justify">Microbes have evolved for billions of years in the presence of essential
and toxic metals and have finely tuned strategies to maintain metal
homeostasis, i.e., maintain an optimal intracellular level of essential
metals, while removing toxic ones. At the cellular level, transcription
regulators (i.e., metal sensing proteins controlling gene expression)
and operator and promoter regions are part of the regulatory circuitry
that controls microbial metal homeostasis and resistance. Bioreporters
can be designed based on this regulatory circuitry and usually provide
early detection, require little pre-treatment, offer increased
sensitivity, can be tailored to be site-specific and are very cost
effective. Numerous bacterial reporters have been created for the
assessment of bioavailable metals and metalloids. Despite their great
potential, however, the application of a biosensor developed in the
laboratory to an environmentally relevant situation is rarely
undertaken. This is often due i) to the lack of portability of the
instruments required to detect and quantify the signal produced by the
biosensors, ii) the inability of the biosensor physiology to adapt to
environmental conditions relevant to metal speciation (e.g., anoxic
environments) and iii) the presence of potential interferences in
complex environmental mixtures due to variations in the affinity of
metals to the sensor proteins.

<p style="text-align:justify">In this talk, I propose to review recent advances in the application of
whole cell biosensors to environmental samples, offer alternatives to
some of the issues currently preventing proper application of biosensors
to environmental samples and use data generated in my laboratory to
explore As and Hg biogeochemical cycles.

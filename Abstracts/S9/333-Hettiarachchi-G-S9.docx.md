<p style="text-align:justify">When contaminant-enriched soil is used for urban gardening, exposure to
contaminants in soils primarily happens in two ways: direct exposure to
contaminated soil (such as soil ingestion) or indirect exposure to
contaminants from the soil-plant-human pathway. In situ stabilization of
contaminants in soil can be achieved through addition of soil
amendments. Over the past 9 years, we studied the manipulation of
bioaccessibility of soil contaminants in urban brownfields and yard
soils via in situ soil amendments and contaminant uptake by food crops
grown on several urban brownfield sites slated for community gardens
throughout the U.S. The challenges in stabilizing the contaminants via
treatments in urban brownfields soils are heightened by unique soil
characteristics, poor soil quality, and the presence of co-contaminants.
The most common soil contaminant at the brownfields sites and the tested
yard soils was lead. We also found elevated arsenic and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons at one or more of our test sites. Our research
indicates that the potential exposure pathway of concern is the direct
exposure of humans to contaminated soils. The pathway from contaminated
soil to plant to human is insignificant. Our research has also shown
that, in general, concentrations of lead, arsenic, and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons in vegetables harvested at test sites were low and
contaminants can be diluted by the addition of clean compost. However,
the concentrations of contaminant uptake appear to be highly dependent
upon soil and other site-specific characteristics. Compost additions
help reduce contaminant concentrations in vegetables. Our results
indicated that most of the lead and arsenic in soils were not
bioaccessible (measured by modified physiologically based extraction
test developed by Ruby et al. 1996). In general, soil treatments further
reduced bioaccessibility of lead and arsenic, although, these reductions
were not always significant. Detailed investigations of the changes in
speciation of soil contaminants using X-ray absorption spectroscopy
indicated a lack of clear changes in speciation except when the mixtures
of soil amendments were added or the ageing of the soil-treatment
mixture had occurred. For mildly contaminated soils, a better
understanding of underlying mechanisms responsible for the effectiveness
of traditionally used in situ stabilization treatments for soil
contaminants as well as new and/or improved in situ treatments in the
presence of co-contaminants is needed. This understanding will help in
developing more practical, safe, and cost-effective alternatives for
dealing with the wide-spread, low levels of soil contamination in the
U.S. and around the world.

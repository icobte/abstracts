<p style=text-align:justify>The exploitation of mineral resources has caused serious soil heavy metal
contamination in China, especially at metal mine sites and the downstream areas.
However, there were few studies assessing the nationwide soil heavy metal
contamination risks induced by mining activities, as well as the major drivers
in influencing metal availabilities. We have collected 420 soil samples from 58
metal mine areas across China and evaluated total and available soil heavy
metals and other soil properties. The geo-accumulation index, potential
ecological risk index, and availability ratios were applied to assess the
potential heavy metal risks levels. The results showed that soil from lead-zinc
mines had the highest pollution level, followed by soil from copper mines and
iron mines. Geologically, the pollution risks were higher in southern China
especially for Cd. A series of multivariate analysis were carried out to
evaluate the environmental drivers regulating metal availabilities on a national
scale. Soil physicochemical property is identified as the major factor relating
to metal availability. Among all detected soil factors, heavy metal availability
was significantly affected by soil pH, and followed by electrical conductivity
and total S content. In sequential equation modeling, geographical category of
annual temperature and precipitation could influence the soil heavy metal
availability by influencing soil category of pH and EC. We provide a
comprehensive assessment of soil heavy metal pollution risks derived from mines
in China while identifying major factors in influencing heavy metal
availabilities on a national scale.

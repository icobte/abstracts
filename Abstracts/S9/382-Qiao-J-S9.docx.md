<p style="text-align:justify">Humic substances (HS) represent an important fraction of natural organic
matter (also known as the extraction artifacts of soil organic matter)
and potentially influence arsenic transformation in soils by serving as
electron shuttles between microorganisms and metal minerals and ions.
However, to date, it remains unclear how HS affect arsenic
transformation in flooded paddy soil. In this study, anaerobic
microcosms were set up amended with three extracted humic fractions
(fulvic acid, FA; humic acid, HA and humin, HM) to investigate the
influence of HS on arsenic transformation in flooded paddy soil.
Chemical analyses revealed that the rate and extent of As(V) reduction
was significantly higher in the HS amended soil microcosms compared to
the soil only control, with the enhancement following the order FA &gt;
HA &gt; HM. It was verified that microbially-reduced HS could act as an
electron shuttle to promote arsenate reduction. The electron shuttling
function of HS is strongly associated with its electron transfer
capacities. This result highlights the important contribution of
microbially reduced HS in arsenic release and reduction in natural paddy
soil. Furthermore, RNA-based high-throughput sequencing showed that HS
can affect the potentially active microbial community for microbial
arsenic reduction. HS increased the relative abundances of <i>Azoarcus</i>,
<i>Anaeromyxobacter</i> and <i>Pseudomonas</i>, all of which are potentially
involved in the reduction of HS, Fe(III) and arsenate. The <i>arrA</i> gene
transcripts clone library showed that FA amendment selected for ArrA
related to <i>Geobacter</i> sp. OR-1 while HA and HM selected for ArrA that
were related to uncultured organisms. Quantitative reverse
transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify the transcription
behavior of bacterial 16S rRNA, <i>arrA</i>, <i>arsC</i> and Geobacter sp. in the
HS amended and non-amended microcosms. The results indicated that HS
stimulated <i>arrA</i> gene and arsenic-respiring <i>Geobacter</i> spp.
transcripts to enhance microbial As(V) reduction. Our results provide a
better understanding of interactions between HS and arsenic reduction in
flooded paddy soil.

<p style="text-align:justify">The iron oxide such as goethtie and humic substances (HS) are the
important active components for metal ions binding in the natural soils.
In the previous study for the modeling the Pb binding in the
goethtie/HS/Pb ternary system, the Linear additivity (LA) model always
underestimeted the Pb bound by the solid phase. This caused by the fact
that the positively charged goethtie can interact with the negatively
charged HS strongly and this interction was not inclued in the LA model.
In this study, the effect of soil fulvic (JGFA) and humic acid (JGHA) on
Pb binding to goethite was studied with the Ligand Charge Distribution
(LCD) model and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) analysis. In the
LCD modeling, the inner-sphere complex between the –FeOH<sup>-0.5</sup> of goethite and
–COOH of HS and three main types of Pb bound as Pb-goethite (Pb bound to
goethite), Pb-HS-goethite (Pb bound to adsorbed HS) and goethite-Pb-HS
(Pb bound as bridge between goethite and HS) were considered.
The spatial distribution
of the small JGFA particles was equal in Stern layer. However part of
the large JGHA particles was presented in diffuse layer which was
determined by the JGHA diameter and environmental conditions. the
results showed that Pb binding to goethite-HS complexes could be
described reasonably well with the LCD model and the speciation
distribution of Pb was analyzed. At low Pb levels, Pb-bridges were important for both JGFA
and JGHA. At high Pb
levels and low HS loading, Pb-goethite almost dominates over the entire
pH range; but at high HS loading, the primary species was goethite-HS-Pb
at acidic pH and goethite-Pb at alkaline pH. Compared with JGFA, there was a constant
contribution of Pb-bridge about 10% for the JGHA. For the Linear
Combination Fit (LCF) analysis of EXAFS spectra for the ternary systems,
the spectra of the binary systems goethite-Pb and HS-Pb were applied as
the reference. The fitting results indicated that with the increased HS
loading more Pb was bound to the adsorbed HS and less to goethite, which
supported the present LCD calculations. The present knowledae contibutes
to a deeper insight into the role of FA and HA in affecting the amount
and speciation of metal ions in soil systems, which is very useful for
improving the accutacy of the risk assessment for heavy metal ion
pollution in soils and the evaluation of environmental quality.

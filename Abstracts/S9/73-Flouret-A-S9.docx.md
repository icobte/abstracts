<p style="text-align:justify"><sup>137</sup>Cs is a radionuclide with a half-life of 30 years that is commonly
found in soils after nuclear fallout due to nuclear incidents or
atmospheric nuclear weapon testing. Due to their properties of
accumulation and retention, soils are key compartments for the transfer
of contaminants such as <sup>137</sup>Cs in the trophic chain. Ingestion of
contaminated agricultural products being one of the main component of
human exposure, it is essential to be able to predict the fate of
<sup>137</sup>Cs throughout the soil-plant continuum. The contaminant mobility
into the soil, its transfer to the plant and its final distribution
between all components are generally described by simple models
(equilibrium-based, linear distributions). These models are operational
but are not able to account for the variability of soils and plants
encountered. Bioavailability is function of both soil physico-chemical
characteristics, that impact the environmental availability, and plant
physiology which determines the uptake rate and accumulation. The aim of
this work is to highlight the preponderant factors controlling the
<sup>137</sup>Cs bioavailability in the soil-solution-plant continuum by using a
model that account for both soil and plant characteristics. The proposed
mechanistic model is based on thermodynamic reactions describing the
interactions of Cs with the different soil reactive components, coupled
with a physiological model of root absorption. Series of experiments
were conducted to produce a contrasted data set of <sup>137</sup>Cs soil to plant
transfer. For those experiments, 2 different plants with contrasted Cs
uptake capacities (Millet, Mustard) and 3 different soils with varying
texture and mineralogy have been studied. Three weeks exposure studies
were conducted with the RHIZOtest® which is a normative device to assess
the bioavailability of contaminants in soil. They were completed with
batch experiments aiming at characterizing the environmental
availability of Cs in soils. A large range of <sup>137</sup>Cs soil to plant
transfer rates was measured for the different soil/pant combinations.
For example a contrasted bioavailability of <sup>137</sup>Cs was observed, with
the same plant accumulating 10% to 40% of total Cs’s stock depending on
the soils. We also observed that during the time of the experiment the
plant had absorbed most of the estimated environmental available Cs.
Modelling those experiments allowed us to highlight the main soil and
plant properties that have a great impact on the contaminant mobility.
For example, plant physiological factors were the main driver of
bioavailability in condition where environmental availability was not
limited (e.g. sandy soils), whereas their roles were reduced in soils
with high <sup>137</sup>Cs sorption capacity. Such a model may help to reduce
uncertainties in the prediction of <sup>137</sup>Cs transfer to plants in
environmental risk assessment, with a great potential to cover a large
range of soils and plants.

<p style="text-align:justify">Mercury (Hg) is a global concern of human health, as the consumption of
fish and shellfish through methylmercury (MeHg) bioaccumulation could
expose human being to health risk. In addition to this aquatic food
chain pathway, recently, considerable levels of MeHg have been found in
rice, particularly in contaminated areas, and thus rice consumption
could act as another major pathway for human exposure to MeHg. The
occurrence of elevated levels of MeHg in rice may suggest that rice
products, such as infant rice cereals, could contain the MeHg being
transferred from the rice used during the manufacture processes.
Analysis of infant cereals commonly marketed in the United States and
China suggests that some rice cereals do contain elevated levels of MeHg
and total Hg (THg), posing potential health risks as infants could
consume rice cereals as a major fraction of their diets. For a more
accurate evaluation of the potential health risks to infants caused by
consumption of rice cereals, the bioaccessibility of MeHg in the rice
cereals was assessed using physiologically based extraction methods. An
in vitro gastrointestinal extraction method was employed to determine
the bioaccessibility of MeHg in rice-based infant cereals and to examine
the factors controlling the MeHg bioaccessibility. The fractions of MeHg
in infant cereals extracted into the dissolved phase (digestive juice)
by simulated gastrointestinal fluids ranged from 25% to 74%. However, it
seems that MeHg, even after being released from the solid matrices,
could be re-adsorbed onto the undigested sample residues during the
course of extraction, which may obstruct the accurate evaluation of the
bioaccessibility of MeHg in the samples. For the purpose of comparison,
fish samples were extracted using the same in vitro method to evaluate
the bioaccessibility of MeHg in fish. The results may suggest that care
should be exercised when using in vitro physiologically based extraction
tests to assess the bioaccessibility of MeHg in food sources and solid
matrices in general.

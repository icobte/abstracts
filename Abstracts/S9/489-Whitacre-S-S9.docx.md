<p style="text-align:justify">The soil matrix can sequester arsenic (As) and reduces its exposure by
soil ingestion. In vivo dosing studies and in vitro gastrointestinal
(IVG) methods have been used to predict relative bioavailable (RBA) As.
Originally, the Ohio State University (OSU-IVG) method predicted RBA As
for soils exclusively from mining and smelting sites with a median of
5,636mg As kg<sup>-1</sup>. The objectives of the current study were to (i)
evaluate the ability of the OSU-IVG method to predict RBA As for As
contaminated soils with a wider range of As content and As contaminant
sources, and (ii) evaluate a modified extraction procedureâ€™s ability to
improve prediction of RBA As. In vitro bioaccessible (IVBA) by OSU-IVG
and California Bioaccessibility Method (CAB) methods, RBA As,
speciation, and properties of 33 As contaminated soils were determined.
Total As ranged from 162 to 12,483 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> with a median of 73 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>. RBA As ranged from 1.30 to 60.0% and OSU-IVG IVBA As ranged from
0.80 to 52.3%. Arsenic speciation was predominantly As(V) adsorbed to
hydrous ferric oxide (HFO) or iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and aluminum
(Al) oxides. The OSU-IVG often extracted significantly less As in vitro
than in vivo RBA As, in particularly for soils from historical gold
mining. The CAB method, which is a modified OSU-IVG method extracted
more As than OSU-IVG for most soils, resulting in a more accurate
predictor than OSU-IVG, especially for low to moderately contaminated
soils (&lt; 1,500mg As kg<sup>-1</sup>) with RBA As = 0.81 IVBA As + 3.2, r<sup>2</sup> =
0.91.

<p style="text-align:justify">The iron (Fe) redox cycle exhibits a unique role in controlling the Cd
bioavailability in the soil-rice system. An amendment developed
independently was selected and a field experiment was carried out to
investigate the Cd transportation from the rhizosphere soil to the Fe
plaque and further to different rice tissues at four different growth
stages and to highlight some possible mechanisms by which the Fe redox
cycle controlled the Cd bioavailability in the rice paddy field. The
results showed that the amendment induced the formation of Fe sulfides,
which co-precipitated with Cd reducing the NH<sub>4</sub>Ac-extractable Cd
contents in rhizosphere soils at the tillering, jointing and filling
stages; the oxidation of Fe sulfides increased the NH<sub>4</sub>Ac-extractable
Cd content in the rhizosphere soil at the maturing stage; the formation
of Fe sulfides in rhizosphere soils impeded the migration of Fe(II) from
the rhizosphere soil to the root surface, decreasing contents of
DCB-extractable Fe and Cd in Fe plaques at the tillering and filling
stages; the Fe redox cycle controlling the Cd activity in rhizosphere
environment decreased the distribution proportion of Cd in the rice
grain at the maturing stage. The exploration of practical remediation
strategies for Cd from the perspective of Fe redox cycle may be
promising.

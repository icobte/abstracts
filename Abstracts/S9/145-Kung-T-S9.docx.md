<p style="text-align:justify">With the development of high-tech industries around the world, the use
of technology-critical elements (TCEs) has rapidly increases in
manufacturing of integrated circuits, optoelectronic devices and solar
cell etc. These trace elements are likely to be released into the
environment and interact with the biosphere. However, the environmental
toxicity and hazardous impact of TCEs are poorly understood. Fish
embryo-larval assays provide high-throughput and effective screening
tools for evaluating toxic elements. In this study, we employed early
life stages of medaka fish (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>) to investigate the acute
mortality and developmental toxicity of several TCEs including vanadium
(V), tellurium (Te) and germanium (Ge). The survival and hatching rates,
heart beat and teratogenic effects of treated embryos were measured
within 6 days of chemical exposures. The locomotor activities of
hatchlings from treated embryos including the average velocity,
percentage time active, relative turn angle, absolute turn angle and
maximum velocity were analyzed at 3 day-post-hatching. The results
showed that the 6-day LC50 value of V was 905.6 mg/L. The hatching time
of treated embryos (400 mg/L V) was delayed with reduced hatching rates
as compared to the control. The heart-beating rates were not
significantly reduced for concentration ranging from 100 to 1000 mg/L as
compared to the control. This is the first study confirming the
embryonic toxicity and larval behavior following V exposure in medaka
fish. The subsequent research will identify the toxicity of Te and Ge.
This study will provide a basis for understanding developmental toxicity
of different TCEs.

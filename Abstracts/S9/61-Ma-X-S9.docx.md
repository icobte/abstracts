<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic (As) is a widespread metalloid and its accumulation in rice has
become a global food safety concern. It is well recognized that the
bioavailability of As to rice roots and subsequent translocation to the
shoots and grains is governed by the biogeochemical conditions in rice
rhizosphere. Increasing applications of nanotechnology-enhanced
agrichemicals have the potential to significantly alter the
biogeochemical conditions in rice rhizosphere and affect As
bioavailability. However, few studies have explored the effects of these
agrichemicals on plant uptake and speciation of As in plant tissues.
Using two popular ENPs in agricultural applications, cerium oxide
nanoparticles (CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), and
two inorganic species of As, arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)), we
investigated their mutual effects on plant metal uptake and accumulation
in a hydroponic system. The results indicated that ZnO NPs significantly
reduced both the As(III) and As(V) specie in rice roots and shoots,
regardless of the oxidation state of the initial As supplied to plants.
The decrease of As(III) content in rice roots is particularly remarkable
when As was initially provided as As(V). In contrast, CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs
demonstrated a much milder effect on As plant accumulation. Neither the
total As nor the As speciation was significantly influenced by CeO<sub>2</sub>
NPs. Alternatively, the co-presence of As did not affect the plant
uptake of Zn from ZnO NPs, but increased Ce in rice shoots in the
treatment containing CeO<sub>2</sub> NPs together with As(III). In summary, we
have observed active interactions between two metallic ENPs and
co-existing inorganic As species in rice tissues, and the extent of
their interactions depend on the properties of ENPs as well as the
initial oxidation state of As.

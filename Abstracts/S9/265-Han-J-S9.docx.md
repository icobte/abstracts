<p style="text-align:justify">Rice consumption is the main methylmercury (MeHg) exposure route for
residents in mercury (Hg) mining areas. However, there is limited
studies on mercury in commercial rice, which has high liquidity and can
be directly consumed by urban residents. In this study, 146 rice samples
were purchased from Guiyang markets, and total Hg (THg) and MeHg
concentrations were measured. Both the inorganic Hg (IHg) and MeHg were
used to calculated estimated daily intakes (EDIs) and hazard quotients
(HQs). The THg concentrations in all rice samples (range: 0.97 to 13.10
μg·kg<sup>−1</sup>; mean: 3.88 μg·kg<sup>−1</sup>) were lower than the Chinese national
standard (20 μg·kg<sup>−1</sup>) set by Chinese Ministry of Health. The average
MeHg concentration in rice was 1.16 μg·kg<sup>−1</sup>. There was no significant
difference between the THg (T test, P=0.61) and MeHg (T test, P=0.17)
concentrations of Japonica rice and Indica rice. Different brands of
rice have different concentrations of THg and MeHg. The total HQs (THQs)
ranged from 0.0106 to 0.1048, with a mean of 0.0462, which was far lower
than 1. This result suggests that there was low Hg exposure through rice
consumption for residents in Guiyang.

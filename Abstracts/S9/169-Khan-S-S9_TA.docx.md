<p style="text-align:justify">Extended periods of flooding can impair the quality of surfacewaters by
mobilising and transporting heavy metals from land to water bodies. The
aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that soil drying followed
by extended flooding enhances solubilisation of metals (Fe, Cu, Co, Zn
and Ni).

<p style="text-align:justify">We tested this hypothesis by flooding samples of two contrasting soils:
a clay soil and a brown earth, which had each been either dried (40°C
for two weeks) or kept at field moisture conditions (36% and 54% of WHC
moisture content respectively). The soils were flooded for 31 days with
a given amount of water (so that 150 g dry-weight equivalent soil
received 400 ml of water). Water sub-samples were collected after day 1,
3, 7, 10, 15, 22 and 31, filtered (0.45µm) and analysed by ICP-MS.

<p style="text-align:justify">The onset of flooding increased dissolved metal concentrations. The
release of metals coincided with a reduction in redox potential,
suggesting reductive dissolution of metal oxides and desorption of
previously sorbed metals. Soil drying resulted in a significant increase
in dissolved metal concentrations relative to the moist counterparts
following flooding. This could be due to a combination of soil drying
(e.g. microbial death, increased crystallinity of metal oxides) and
flooding (reductive dissolution of metal oxides) associated factors. The
clayey soil released significantly (p&lt;0.05) greater quantities of
metals, perhaps due to its greater organic matter (OM), as soil drying
may reduce the stability of OM-metal complexes.

<p style="text-align:justify">Our results suggest that extended periods of drying-flooding have the
potential to promote mobilisation of soil metals and thus have
implications for catchment water quality.

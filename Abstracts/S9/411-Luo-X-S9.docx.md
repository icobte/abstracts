<p style="text-align:justify">Atmospheric particle pollution is a serious environmental issue
threating human health, especially in the megacities of China. As a key
aerosol component with high risk implications, PM<sub>2.5</sub> associated trace
metals pose significant risks to human health through inhalation. The
bioaccessible fraction absorbed by human lung is a prerequisite for
reliable assessment of the potential hazards of toxic trace metals in
PM<sub>2.5</sub> via inhalation exposure. To accurately assess the inhalation
risks of airborne metals, four <i>in vitro</i> physiologically based
extraction tests (PBET) with synthetic agents comparable to human lung
fluids were conducted to assess pulmonary bioaccessibility of trace
metals in PM<sub>2.5</sub> from different function areas (urban, industrial,
suburban, rural) of Nanjing city, China. Based on the comparisons
between bioaccessibility and human health risks of airborne trace metals
from varied sources using different extraction methods, the primary
inhalable toxic trace metals and suitable extraction method were
expected. The standardized and systematic methods for <i>in vitro</i>
bioaccessibility tests of inhalable metals are needed. and for future
risk assessments of atmospheric particulate metals, incorporating the
bioaccessibility supported by suitable speciation methods are
directions.

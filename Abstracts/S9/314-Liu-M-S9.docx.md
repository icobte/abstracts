<p style="text-align:justify">Heavy metals are not degraded in aquatic environment and the
transportation of heavy metals greatly affects their bioavailability.
Dissolved organic matter (DOM) plays an important role in the
transportation of heavy metals in aquatic environment. Previous research
has proven that molecular size and composition of
DOM can be changed under the action of microbial degradation and
self-assembly. How these changes of DOM affect the transportation of
heavy metals is unknown. We collected the colloidal precursors (i.e.
&lt;1kDa) and bulk DOM from Haihe river and incubated them in the dark
for 21 days. Ultrafiltration, fluorescence spectroscopy and parallel
factor analysis (PARAFAC) were used to divide DOM into different
molecular size and examine the change of DOM in molecular size and composition during the incubation.
Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was to examine the
transportation of heavy metals between different molecular size. Results
shows that the concentrations of total organic carbon, carbohydrates,
and protein-like substances decreased while the concentration of humic-and fulvic-like substance remained
relatively constant during incubation. Under the action of microbial
degradation and self-assembly, the dissolved organic matter in &lt;1kDa
and 10kDa to 0.45μm molecular size was reduced while the dissolved
organic matter in 1kDa to 10kDa and &gt;0.45μm section was increased,
which suggested a transportation pathway of DOM. The carbohydrates and
protein-like substances decreased especially in &gt;10kDa section
suggested that the carbohydrates and protein-like substance are easily
degraded by microorganisms. The concentration of humic-and fulvic-like
substance remained relatively constant during incubation but in
molecular size level they showed a transformation pathway from the
&lt;1kDa to colloids (1kDa–0.45μm) and further to microparticles
(&gt;0.45μm). Meanwhile, different heavy metals had different
transportation. Fe showed the highest affinity with dissolved organic matter of
1kDa to 10kDa, and mainly transported among
high molecular size DOM. Zn and Cr showed the intermediate affinity with
the dissolved organic matter of 1kDa to 10kDa and mainly transported
between 1kDa to 10kDa and &lt;1kDa section. Cd showed the lowest
affinity with dissolved organic matter and mainly exist in &lt;1kDa
section. This finding provides new insights into the transportation of
heavy metals in aquatic system.

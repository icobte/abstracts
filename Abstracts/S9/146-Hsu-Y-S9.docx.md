<p style="text-align:justify">Thallium (Tl) is a priority pollutant with high toxicity and exposure
risk. With rapid development of high-tech industries,
technology-critical elements such as Tl could be released into the paddy
soils via use of manufacturing wastewater as irrigating water sources
for rice culture. The Tl occurrence in contaminated paddy soils was
detected in previous studies; however, the pollutant transportation,
bioavailability and environmental toxicity of Tl in contaminated paddy
field are less known. In this study, we aim to use medaka fish as a
model to assess the bioavailability and toxicity in Tl-contaminated
paddy soil. Medaka embryos were exposed to different concentrations of
Tl (0-1000 mg/L). The rates of survival, hatching and heart-beating were
measured in embryos within 6 days of exposures. The locomotor activities
of hatchings from treated embryos including average velocity, percentage
time active, relative turn angle, absolute turn angle and maximum
velocity were analyzed at 3 day-post-hatching. The results showed that
the 6-day LC<sub>50</sub> value of Tl was above 1000 mg/L. The heart-beating
rates were significantly reduced for concentration ranging from 200 to
1000 mg/L as compared to the control. The hatching rates were not
significant as compared to the control. The subsequent research will
establish a biological exposure system for stimulating Tl-contaminated
paddy fields to evaluate the Tl bioavailability from soil to medaka
fish.

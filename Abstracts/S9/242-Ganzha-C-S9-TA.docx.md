<p style="text-align:justify">Among the water bodies, exposed to the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant
accident, the cooling pond (CP) is one of the most contaminated with
radionuclides. Currently, over 320 TBq of biologically hazardous,
long-lived radionuclides are concentrated in the CP ecosystem. Since the
end of 2014, the drawdown of water level in the CP continues, which
leads to the drainage of radioactively contaminated bottom sediments. CP
is considered as a potential source of additional radiation exposure to
the environment. The decrease of the water level in the CP at the
present stage has led to an essential change in the hydrological,
hydrobiological and hydrochemical regimes, which in the future will
inevitably change the physicochemical forms of radionuclides, their
mobilization and redistribution between the components of the aquatic
ecosystem. The purpose of the research was to establish the features of
migration and distribution of physicochemical forms of <sup>90</sup>Sr and
<sup>137</sup>Cs in the components of the CP ecosystem. During 2017-2018 samples
of coastal soils, bottom sediments, aquatic plants and bivalve mollusks
were taken. The physicochemical forms of <sup>90</sup>Sr and <sup>137</sup>Cs were
determined by sequential extraction. Measurement of the activity of
radionuclides in fractions was performed using β-radiometric and
γ-spectrometric methods.

<p style="text-align:justify">As a result of the studies performed, it was found that in silty and
sandy-silt bottom sediments of the CP deposits at depths of 3–7 m, up to
55% of <sup>90</sup>Sr cations were in potentially exchangeable forms capable of
passing into solution and absorbed by hydrobionts. The exchange activity
of <sup>90</sup>Sr in the soils of the coastal strip did not exceed 10% of the
total amount. The carbonate form of <sup>90</sup>Sr, not involved in active
metabolic processes, was 2–8% and 6–32% for silty and sandy-silty bottom
sediments, respectively, and up to 46% for soils. The content of <sup>90</sup>Sr
in organic form in soils and bottom sediments was 34-50%, which
indicates the presence of a certain reserve of the radionuclide, which
can be absorbed by plants during the root feeding process. The
distribution of potentially exchangeable forms of <sup>137</sup>Cs in bottom
sediments is characterized by insignificant radionuclide content in all
studied forms and does not exceed 16%, with the prevalence of the
exchange form at depths up to (14%). Thus, about 80% of the radionuclide
is inaccessible for metabolic processes in the ecosystem. <sup>90</sup>Sr in
aquatic plants was predominantly found in potentially exchange forms,
namely, 25–30% in the form of adsorbed extracellular cations. <sup>137</sup>Cs
prevails in fixed forms (up to 50%), which indicates the ability of
plants to deposit the radionuclide. In the shells of bivalve mollusks,
radionuclides are mainly found in fixed forms (50-80%). In the soft
tissues of mollusks, the main share of <sup>90</sup>Sr is in the form associated
with organic matter (about 50%) and <sup>137</sup>Cs is mainly concentrated in
fixed forms (more than 60%). The еimplementation of such studies will
allow us to evaluate the processes and parameters of physicochemical
transformations of radionuclides in the system of "bottom sediments -
water - hydrobionts", as well as to establish indicators for the
remobilization of radionuclides and their subsequent redistribution
between the biotic components of the aquatic ecosystem. This, in turn,
will allow developing migration models and improving existing methods
for forecasting the behavior of radionuclides in water ecosystems in a
context of decrease of the water level.

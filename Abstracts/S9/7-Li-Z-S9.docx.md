<p style="text-align:justify">Environmental microorganisms have been widely applied in heavy metal
remediation. Successful application of the fungi depends on their
tolerance to heavy metals. Pb is the one of the most common heavy metals
in contaminated environments. We hence explored the mechanisms of lead
tolerance between two typical filamentous fungi, <i>A. niger</i> and <i>P.
oxalicum</i>. The mechanisms of reducing the Pb toxicity by the two fungi
have three major pathways. First, secreted oxalic acid reacts with Pb
(II) to form insoluble Pb minerals. Second, the enhanced biosorption via
new border of cell wall could prevent Pb (II) transported into hypha.
Finally, fungal activity could be maintained even at high Pb
concentration due to the intracellular accumulation. Moreover, <i>A.
niger</i> has the higher Pb tolerance (up to 1500 mg/L Pb level) compared
with <i>P. oxalicum</i> (up to 1000 mg/L). Pb levels below 1000 mg/L
partially stimulate the bioactivity of <i>A. niger</i>, which is confirmed by
its elevated respiration (from 53 to 63 mg C L<sup>-1</sup> medium h<sup>-1</sup>). This
subsequently enhanced some functions of <i>A. niger</i> to resist Pb
toxicity. A better understanding of Pb tolerance of these two fungi
sheds a bright future of applying them to remediate lead-contaminated
environments.

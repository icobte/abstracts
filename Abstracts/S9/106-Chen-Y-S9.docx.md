<p style="text-align:justify">Goethite (Gt) and humic acid (HA) are important components of soil that
significantly affect Cd mobility. In this study, the co-transport of
Cd<sup>2+</sup> and Gt with/without HA in saturated sand columns was investigated
by monitoring the breakthrough curves at different pH values. A solute
transport model was used to study Cd<sup>2+</sup> transport and retention in the
saturated sand in the presence of Gt and HA, and a colloid transport
model was used to describe the Gt colloid (Gt<sub>C</sub>) transport in the
columns. Our results showed that the transport behaviors of Cd<sup>2+</sup> and
Gt colloids/aggregates were regulated by pH. Cadmium transport was
significantly inhibited at high pH due to its adsorption on the sand and
Gt. Moreover, Gt retention was gradually stabilized with increasing pH
regardless of its forms, i.e., individual colloids (Gt<sub>C</sub>) or larger
assemblages of particles due to aggregation (Gt<sub>A</sub>). This retention was
obviously enhanced in the presence of HA. Thus, the superposition of
increased Cd<sup>2+</sup> adsorption on Gt and Gt retention (stabilization)
enhanced the immobilization of Cd<sup>2+</sup> at high pH. In addition to
stabilizing Gt, HA further enhance Cd<sup>2+</sup> adsorption on Gt, thus
promoting Cd<sup>2+</sup> immobilization. However, only a small amount of
organicmatter-bound Cd2+ was observed in the columns with injected HA.
The major fractions of retained Cd<sup>2+</sup> were exchangeable Cd<sup>2+</sup> and
Fe-oxide-bound Cd<sup>2+</sup>. Our results provide new insights into the roles
of Gt and HA in the transport and mobilization of Cd<sup>2+</sup> in
soil-groundwater systems.

<p style="text-align:justify">Contamination of phosphorus (P) and arsenic (As) has drawn much
attention in the past decades. Both P and As are predominantly present
as inorganic oxyanions in both terrestrial and aquatic systems, i.e. as
phosphate, arsenate and arsenite. The mobility and bioavailability of P
and As are greatly influenced by the adsorption of their oxyanions to
metal (hydr)oxides. Goethite is one of the most abundant iron
(hydr)oxide minerals in natural environment. The adsorption of P and As
by iron (hydr)oxides is strongly affected by pH. Apart from pH, natural
organic matter (NOM), which frequently co-occurs together with
oxyanions, plays an important role in influencing the adsorption of
oxyanions. However, the composition and properties of NOM (e.g. particle
size) often vary with the sources, which makes the understanding and
prediction of oxyanion adsorption challenging. Because NOM contains
large amounts of carboxylic and phenolic type of functional groups,
which interact strongly with metal (hydr)oxides, we thus hypothesize
that the site density of functional groups on NOM is the controlling
factors influencing the adsorption of oxyanions at goethite-water
interface. In this study, we investigated the adsorption of phosphate,
arsenate and arsenite onto goethite in the absence and presence of NOM
(four humic acids (HA), three fulvic acids (FA)) derived from different
soils as a function of pH (pH 3-11), and surface loading of oxyanions or
NOM. In combination with laboratory analysis, model calculation can
reveal the whole fingerprint of surface speciation and can make
predictions. Thus, the NOM-CD (CD: Charge Distribution) and LCD (Ligand
and Charge Distribution) model were applied to describe these
interactions and the performance of these two models were compared.
Results show that the adsorption of oxyanions to goethite is decreased
by the presence of NOM, especially for phosphate and arsenate at low pH.
Effects of the three FA are similar, which are more effective than HA in
reducing oxyanion adsorption at pH &lt;6. Differences were observed
between the four HA in their competition with oxyanions. The adsorption
of phosphate, arsenate and arsenite in the presence of NOM are well
described with both the NOM-CD and LCD model. The NOM-CD model is
relatively simple to use, whereas the LCD model can better reveal
different factors in the interaction, including the spatial distribution
of adsorbed NOM on oxide surfaces. According to these two models: site
density of carboxylic groups, protonation constant of carboxylic groups,
and particle size of NOM are major properties of NOM determining its
effect on oxyanion adsorption to oxides. At relatively low loadings,
morphological change of adsorbed NOM takes place, and the degree of
morphological change of adsorbed NOM depends on the particle size, site
density of carboxylic groups and aromaticity of NOM. The influence of
particle size on the interaction becomes more important at higher NOM
loadings. The understanding obtained in this work can be used in the
future to explain and predict the mobility of anionic pollutants such as
P and As in soil and water, and to design pollution remediation measures
in, e.g. groundwater, agricultural drainage, paddy field or waste water.

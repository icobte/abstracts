<p style="text-align:justify">As-contaminated soil was considered to be harmful, while low-As soil was
often neglected in health risk assessment. Considering the pathopoiesia
of As at low concentration and noticeable ingestion of low-As soil, this
research investigated the As bioaccessibility and species of low-As soil
in whole digestive tract and the role of colon microbes in the
regulation of As bioaccessibility and its species by utilizing a
combined <i>in vitro</i> model UBM-SHIME (Unified BARGE Method-Simulator of
Human Intestinal Microbial Ecosystem). Results indicated that the As
bioaccessibility of all the soils to range from 11.39% to 20.99% in
stomach, from 12.42% to 34.48% in small intestine and from 11.75% to
22.92% in colon, respectively. Speciation analysis showed only inorganic
arsenic (iAs) was detected in stomach and the small intestinal
extraction solution, with arsenate (As(V)) being the dominated As
speciation (70.5%~87.9% of total As in extraction solution). In
addition, As species was significantly altered by the active colon which
resulted in the formation of methylated As species. Except for
monomethylarsonic acid (MMA(V)) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA(V)) of low
toxicity, a highly toxic As species, monomethylarsonous acid (MMA(III)),
was observed in the colon. Moreover, a high level of
monomethylmonothioarsonic acid (MMMTA(V)) (up to 25.9% of total As in
extraction solution ) of unclear toxicological properties was also
detected. The formation of various organic As species demonstrated that
human colon microorganisms had the ability to actively metabolise iAs
into methylated arsenicals and methylated thio-arsenicals. Such
transformation should be considered seriously when assessing the human
health risks associated with oral exposure to low-As soil.

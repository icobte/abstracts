<p style=text-align:justify>Iron oxides is one of the
soil active components and can adsorb external pollutants such as heavy
metals in soil. Hematite (α-Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is the most common and stable
iron oxides in tropical and subtropical soils. Due to its various
morphologies, small particle size, and relatively strong surface
reactivity, hematite can act as a strong adsorbent for soluble
contaminants in soils and sediments. Al-substitution in hematite is
ubiquitous in nature and affect the microstructure of hematite and its
adsorption properties of metal ions. Thus Al-substitution in hematite
strongly affects the environmental behaviors of hematite. However,
the microstructure caused
by Al-substitution and its inner relationship with the surface
reactivity of hematite remain unclear. In this study, the crystal
structure of Al-substituted hematite was characterized by
high-resolution electron transmission microscopy (HRTEM) and high angle
annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy
(HAADF-STEM). Acid-base titration and Pb<sup>2+</sup> adsorption experiments were
performed to investigate the surface reactivity of Al-substituted
hematite. HRTEM images revealed that the
proportion of (001) facets on hematite increased from 44.0 ± 3.8% to
84.8 ± 6.5% with increasing Al-substitution. HAADF-STEM images indicated
that Al-substitution resulted in more vacancies of Fe atoms on hematite (001)
facets. At these Fe defect sites, additional singly (≡FeOH<sup>-0.5</sup>) and
triply (≡Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sup>-0.5</sup>) coordinated hydroxyl sites were formed. The
weight loss due to
dehydrogenation followed the order of H-10 (6.2%) &gt; H-5 (3.3%) &gt;
H-0 (1.7%). Besides, the relative percentage of surface oxygen atoms in
the surface hydroxyl sites of Al-substituted hematite was consistent
with the results of thermogravimetric analysis. At pH 5, the relative
charge density of H-0, H-5 and H-10 was 73, 94 and 241 mC/m<sup>2</sup>, and
their adsorption capacity for Pb<sup>2+</sup> was 0.82, 1.23 and 3.51 μmol/m<sup>2</sup>,
respectively. A similar trend was observed at pH 6. The results of
pH-edge experiments further revealed that Al-substitution strongly
enhanced the adsorption affinity of hematite for Pb<sup>2+</sup>. These results
indicate that the formation of more defect sites with increasing
Al-substitution can significantly enhance the surface charge density and
Pb<sup>2+</sup> adsorption capacity of hematite. These results also clarify the
relationship between defect structures and Pb<sup>2+</sup> adsorption of
Al-substituted hematite and expand the understanding of the surface
reactivity of Al-substituted iron oxides for various heavy metals.

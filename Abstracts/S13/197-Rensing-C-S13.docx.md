<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic is a metalloid that occurs naturally in aquatic and terrestrial
environments. The high toxicity of arsenic derivatives converts this
element in a serious problem of public health worldwide. There is a
global arsenic geocycle in which microbes play a relevant role. Ancient
exposure to arsenic derivatives, both inorganic and organic, has
represented a selective pressure for microbes to evolve or acquire
diverse arsenic resistance genetic systems. In addition, arsenic
compounds appear to have been used as a toxin in chemical warfare for a
long time selecting for an extended selection of arsenic resistance
determinants. Arsenic resistance strategies rely mainly on membrane
transport pathways that extrude the toxic compounds from the cell
cytoplasm. The ars operons, first discovered in bacterial R-factors
almost 50 years ago, are the most common microbial arsenic resistance
systems. Numerous ars operons, with a variety of genes and different
combinations of them, populate the prokaryotic genomes, including their
accesory plasmids, transposons and genomic islands. Besides these
canonical, widespread ars gene clusters, which confer resistance to the
inorganic forms of arsenic, additional genes have been discovered
recently, which broadens the spectrum of arsenic tolerance by
detoxifying organic arsenic derivatives ofen used as toxins. This talk
will summarize the presence, distribution, organization and redundance
of arsenic resistance genes in prokaryotes.

<p style=text-align:justify>The in situ immobilization of metal-contaminated sediment, using various
amendments, has attracted great attention owing to their
cost-effectiveness. The present study investigated the effectiveness of
Chinese loess on Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb stabilization by decreasing their
bioavailability in contaminated sediment. The loess was mixed with the sediment in
doses of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 kg. Approximately 70 d after loess
application, the effectiveness was evaluated using the Tessier
sequential extraction procedure, single extractants (EDTA-2Na, DTPA, CaCl<sub>2</sub> and
HCl), toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and column
leaching experiment. The results indicated that the loess can
effectively transform Cu from the carbonate fraction into the residual
fraction when the loess dose was ≥ 5 kg. Results from TCLP confirmed
loess reduced leaching rate of Cu and Zn achieving up to 42.4% and 17.6%
reductions, respectively, when compared with untreated sediment. The
loess could significantly immobilize Cu and Zn in sediment, and the
optimum dose of loess in 10 kg wet sediment was 5 kg. However, loess was
inefficient for Cd and Pb immobilization. Correlation analysis showed
that these four extractants and TCLP extraction method can provide a
good indication of the toxicity of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in the amended
sediment. Column leaching experiment showed that heavy metal in the
loess-amended sediment migrated vertically, and the Cu concentration in
leachate of the columns in this study will not cause pollution to
groundwater within at least 7 years. These results highlight the
potential for using Chinese loess as in situ sorbent amendment for
sediment remediation.

<p style=text-align:justify>Elevated concentrations of Hg in a range of environmental compartments
(e.g., rivers, sediment, lakes, and oceans) are a world-wide concern,
especially for sediment that is a sink for Hg accumulation. Different
remediation methods have been evaluated for mercury removal or
stabilization. These methods include sediment dredging, amendment using
activated carbon or biochar, etc. However, most of the remediation
methods are expensive and the long-term fate of Hg has not been well
investigated.

<p style=text-align:justify>Here we investigated the effectiveness of activated carbon and four
types of biochar, including (switchgrass (300°C and 600°C), poultry
manure (600°C), and oak (~700°C)) to stabilize Hg in contaminated
sediment under anaerobic conditions for 1030 days. The feed stocks of
these biochars are widely available and can be used for biochar
production at low cost. The results indicate aqueous concentrations of
total Hg and methylmercury generally decreased in the presence of
biochars, with the exception of a spike in methylmercury concentration
observed at ~440 days in the switchgrass at 600°C and oak biochar
systems. The change of total Hg and methylmercury in sediment controls
and amended systems corresponded to the observation of potential mercury
methylators and change of carbon sources for the microbes, and total Fe
and sulfate concentrations in solution.

<p style=text-align:justify>Identification of the mechanisms controlling Hg uptake by these biochar
particles was determined using X-ray fluorescence imaging (XRFI) and
X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, including micro-X-ray
fluorescence (micro-XRF) mapping, confocal micro-X-ray fluorescence
imaging (CMXRFI), Hg extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS),
and S X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). Micro-XRF maps and
CMXRFI show that Hg co-exists with S, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn on the surface
and inside the biochar particles. EXAFS modeling shows that Hg is in an
oxide form on the surface of an iron (hydro)oxide particle from fresh
sediment and in Hg-sulfide forms in biochar samples. S XANES analyses
show that sulfide is present within the biochar particles. After
amendment with biochars, a fraction of the Hg originally present in
unstable forms (dissolvable, HgO, colloidal, nano, etc.) in the sediment
was likely stabilized as less soluble Hg-sulfide phases on the surface
or within the biochar particles.

<p style=text-align:justify>Based on the aqueous and solid phase analysis, three primary geochemical
stages were assigned to the microcosm experiment, including nitrate
reduction, overlapped iron and sulfate reduction, and methanogenic
stages. Methylmercury was primarily generated during the overlapped iron
and sulfate reduction stages. Total Hg was under control after the
overlapped iron and sulfate reduction stage. The Hg that accumulated in
the biochar through this process is expected to remain stable for a
prolonged period. Further, this process may also be extended to the
accumulation of other hazardous metal elements.

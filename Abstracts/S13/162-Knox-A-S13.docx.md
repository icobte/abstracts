<p style=text-align:justify>Mesocosms were used to investigate the effects of Cu influx, alone and
in the presence of other elements, on sediments remediated by active
caps, passive caps, and in-situ treatment. Competitive interactions
between Cu and other elements were investigated because contaminants
often co-occur. Our hypothesis was that the sequestering agents used in
active caps and in situ treatments will bind elements introduced from
uncontrolled sources of ongoing contamination, thereby reducing their
bioavailability and protecting underlying, previously remediated
sediments from recontamination. Competitive interactions between Cu and
other elements were investigated to better understand conditions
occurring at actual contaminated sediment sites where several
contaminants often co-occur. Tested elements in surface water remained
at significantly lower concentrations in mesocosms with apatite and
mixed amendment caps than in mesocosms with passive caps (sand),
uncapped sediment, and spike solution throughout the 2880-hour
experiment. Element concentrations were significantly higher in
<i>Lumbriculus variegatus</i> from untreated sediment than in organisms from
most active caps, and regressions of element concentrations in
<i>Lumbriculus</i> on element concentrations in the top 2.5 cm of sediment or
cap measured by DGT were strong and significant (p&lt;0.05) for most
tested elements. Our findings showed that some types of active caps can
protect remediated sediments by reducing the bioavailable pool of
elements from ongoing sources of contamination and that the ability of
mixed amendment caps to control the bioaccumulation of Cu was not
affected by the presence of other elements. This knowledge will
contribute to more rigorous risk management that incorporates the
resilience of remedies in the face of ongoing contamination into the
criteria for remedy selection.

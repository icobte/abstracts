<p style=text-align:justify>Mycorrhizal fungi may show more potential in phytoremediation than
rhizosphere microbes by providing nutrients to plants and enhancing
metal bioavailability in the rhizosphere of plants by producing
metabolites. However, little is known about the effects soil pollution
type on mycorrhizal fungal communities. In present study, the diversity
and composition of mycorrhizal fungal from <i>Arundo donax, a good
candidates to phytoremediation,</i> which grown in different soil types
(including metal pollution soil, red mud and un-pollution soil) were
compared using the Illumina MiSeq sequencing technique. The results
showed that the heavy metal polluted soil had significant higher
mycorrhizal fungi alpha diversity than those from unpolluted and red mud
area. Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) analysis showed
significant differences among different soil types. At genus level,
<i>Marasmiellus</i> sp.（81.16%）was enriched in the unpolluted soil,
<i>Zopfiella_marina</i> (56.52%) in heavy metal soil and an unclassified
species (Hypocreales) (93.17%). This effort to profile the background
diversity may set the first stage for the remediation of contaminated
soil by plant-mycorrhizal fungal combinations.

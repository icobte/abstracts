<p style=text-align:justify>A field study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of enhanced tobacco
for phytoremediation of contaminated soils. The experiment was performed
on an agricultural field highly contaminated (1526.2 mg/kg Zn, 1158.8
mg/kg Pb and 36.8 mg/kg Cd) by the Non-Ferrous-Metal Works near Plovdiv,
Bulgaria. The content of heavy metals in different parts of three
varieties of enhanced tobacco (roots, stalks, lower, middle and upper
leaves) was determined by ICP. A clearly distinguished species
peculiarity existed in the accumulation of heavy metals in the organs of
tobacco. Cd levels occur in the order, lower leaves &gt; middle
leaves &gt; upper leaves &gt; stalk &gt; root, while Pb and Zn levels
occur in the order middle leaves &gt; lower leaves &gt; upper
leaves &gt; stalk &gt; root. The content of Cd in upper, middle, and
lower leaves reached to 155.6 mg/kg, 120.8 mg/kg, 67.7 mg.kg,
respectively. Pb content reached to 1062.5 mg/kg, 927.8 mg/kg, 884.4
mg/kg and Zn to 936.7 mg/kg, 860.1 mg/kg, 459.4 mg/kg. To be able to
give an answer for the abilities of the enhanced tobacco to extract
heavy metals from the soil and to assess the potential of enhanced
tobacco for phytoextraction, the translocation factor
(TF=Cshoots/Croots) and bioaccumulation factor (BF=Cshoots/Csoils) were
calculated. The translocation factor for all metals is greater than 1(TF
Pb -13, TF Zn -9, TF Cd -8). The BF values were lower than TF and
reached to 1.2 for Pb, 3.3 for Zn and 4.9 for Cd. Higher root to shoot
translocation of these metals indicated that enhanced tobacco have vital
characteristics to be used for phytoextraction of these metals.None of
these varieties of enhanced tobacco was specified as a hyperaccumulator;
nevertheless, all varieties show potential for phytoextraction of Pb,
Zn, and Cd. Further studies are required to determine the utilization of
residual products of phytoextraction and to enhance the economic value
of this crop when growing on industrially polluted soils.

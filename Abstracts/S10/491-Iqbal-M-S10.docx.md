<p style=text-align:justify>Soil pollution with chromium (Cr) has become one of the most important
concerns due to its toxicity for humans. To date, various remediation
approaches have been employed for the remediation and management of Cr
contaminated soils. Phytoextraction is an ecofriendly and emerging
remediation approach which has gain attention due to several advantages
over conventional remediation approach. The use of energy crops for
phytoremediation is an emerging trend worldwide. These energy crops have
high tolerance against various environmental stresses, potential to grow
in diverse ecosystems and high biomass production make them a suitable
candidate for phytoremediation of contaminated soils. The removal
efficiency of plants in phytoextraction depends upon several soil and
plant factors including solubility, bioavailability and metal speciation
in soils. A pot scale experiment was conducted to evaluate the
phytoextraction potential of <i>Arundo donax</i> L with the application of
acetic acid (A.A) in Cr contaminated soils. Plants were grown in pots
filled with 5kg soils for 90 days. After 30 days plants acclimatization
in pot conditions, plants were treated with various levels of Cr (2.5
mM, 5 mM, 7.5 mM, 10 mM) and A.A (Cr 2.5 mM + A.A 2.5 mM, Cr 5 mM + A.A
2.5 mM, Cr 7.5 mM + A.A 2.5 mM, Cr 10 mM + A.A 2.5 mM). The application
of A.A significantly increased metal uptake and in roots and shoots of
<i>A. donax</i>. This increase was observed at Cr7.5 mM + A.A 2.5 mM but at
high concentrations visual symptoms of Cr toxicity were observed on
leaves. Similarly, A.A applications also affect the activities of key
enzymes including catalase (CAT), superoxidase dismutase (SOD), and
ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in leaves of <i>A. donax</i>. Based on results it
is concluded that the applications of A.A acid for phytoextraction is an
alternative approach for the management of Cr affected soils and
synthetic chelators should be replaced with organic acids.

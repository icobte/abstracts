<p style=text-align:justify>An experimental approach combining laboratory columns and field
lysimeters leaching was developed to evaluate the mobility and retention
of Zinc, lead and Cadmium, in ore residues stabilized with metallicolous
plants. Ore residues of the ancient zinc mine “The Avinières”
(St-Laurent-le-minier, France), stored in tailing ponds, were collected
and homogenised before filling the columns and lysimeters. These setups
were unplanted (controls) or vegetated with three plant species:
<i>Anthyllis Vulneraria</i> (metallicolous plant), <i>Festuca arvernensis</i> and
<i>Koeleria vallesiana,</i> alone or mixed<i> A. Vulneraria</i> was mycorhized
with <i>Mesorhizobium metallidurans</i> in order to improve its growth
through nitrogen fixation. Rain simulations were performed every month
or 6 months on the columns and lysimeters, respectively. Water balance
was controlled to be equivalent in both situations. Physical and
geochemical factors were monitored all along the period and especially
during the leaching experiments (water flux, pH, heavy metal content,
ionic mass balance…). These factors were shown to be quite constant
during each leaching experiment but evolved significantly with time and
also between the different vegetation conditions. Plant growth was shown
to modify water infiltration and metal concentrations in the leachates.
<p style=text-align:justify>The temporal increase of water flux observed in the columns and
lysimeters along the infiltration experiments was attributed to the
rhizophere development. In columns and lysimeters vegetated with A.
vulneraria only, high nitrate contents were measured in the leachates,
in relation with nitrogen fixation. On the contrary when <i>A. vulneraria</i>
was associated with <i>F. arvernensis</i> alone or with <i>K. vallesiana</i>,
nitrate was directly consumed by the latter two plants and further
undetected in the leachates, demonstrating the advantage of plant
associations for phytoremediation actions. Furthermore compared to
unplanted columns or lysimeters, the leaching of cadmium and zinc in
vegetated ore residues was significantly and variably decreased
depending on the number of plant species. On the contrary, lead
mobilization from the ore residues was very low in relation with its low
water solubility, and seemed unaffected by plants introduction. Our
results showed that plant species introduction modifies both the
physical properties of the ore residue and also its geochemistry, with
strong benefits in terms of plant growth and heavy metal retention.
Modelling of these results with a combined hydro-geochemical approach is
ongoing and will help better understanding the processes involved in
metal transfer limitation. These results thus demonstrate the benefit of
mixing grass and metallicolous plants to stabilize ore residues from
mining activities.

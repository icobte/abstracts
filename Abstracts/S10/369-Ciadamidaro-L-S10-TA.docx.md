<p style=text-align:justify>Afforestation of soils contaminated by potentially toxic element (PTE),
notably with fast growing trees producing large biomass has been
demonstrated to be an attractive option for their bioremediation.
Mycorrhizal fungi form symbiotic associations with plants, contributing
to their tolerance towards toxic elements and actively participating to
the biorestoration processes. The aim of this study was to deepen
understanding the mycorrhizal community in 2 PTE-contaminated sites
(Pierrelaye and Fresnes-sur-Escaut, France) planted with poplar trees
(<i>P. trichocarpa x P. maximowiczii</i>) in order to underline the
environmental factors affecting the abundance, diversity and structure
of microbial communities. The 2 sites (around 1 ha each) were divided
into 4 replicated field blocks with a final plant density of 2200 tree
h<sup>-1</sup>. Half of the trees were inoculated with a commercial inoculum made
of a mix of mycorrhizal species. The sites presented different
physico-chemical characteristics and various PTE contamination levels
(mostly Cd and Zn). Field inoculation had a significant positive effect
on biomass production on the 2 sites; although the beneficial effect
tended to decrease with time. We characterized the fungal communities
using Illumina Miseq sequencing. Although, detailed study of the fungal
composition demonstrated a predominance of Ascomycota at both sites,
higher percentages were found in Pierrelaye soil. In general, the
majority of OTUs for the 2 sites is shared between the two treatments,
but Pierrelaye site showed higher homogeneity of OTUs distribution
compared to Fresnes-sur-Escaut. Overall, 227 OTUs (≈29%) were shared by
all habitats and the highest proportions of unique OTUs is observed in
Pierrelaye soil (≈30%). Furthermore, mycorrhizal colonisation rate
showed differences in percentage between treatments just for Pierrelaye
site. Finally, fungal community appeared to be highly constrained by
soil characteristics at the phytomanagement sites. The detailed
distribution of fungal OTUs within the various phyla and guilds will be
further discussed in the presentation.

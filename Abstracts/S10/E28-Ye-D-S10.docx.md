<p style=text-align:justify>Chelate-assisted phytoremediation with biodegradable chelates has
developed to be a promising technique to enhance phytoremediation
efficiency. Application of 2 mmol NTA kg<sup>-1</sup> could greatly improve Pb
remediation efficiency by <i>Athyrium wardii</i> (Hook.), a dominant plant species for Pb
phytostabilization. However, no information is available about the
effect of 2 mmol NTA kg<sup>-1</sup> application on the transfer and
transformation of Pb in soils and soil biochemical properties associated
with <i>A. wardii</i> (Hook.). Thus, an incubation experiment was firstly
conducted in soil with 800 mg Pb kg<sup>-1</sup> to obtain an appropriate
treatment time for NTA to optimize NTA-assisted Pb phytostabilization by
<i>A. wardii</i>. The lowest pH and greatest Pb availability in soils was
observed after NTA addition for 7 days. Secondly, a column experiment
was processed with 0-20 cm soil contaminated with 800 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Pb to investigate that the effect of 2 mmol NTA
kg<sup>-1</sup> application on Pb transformation, solubilization, and leaching
risk of Pb in soil layers, and the changes of rhizosphere soil
biochemical properties. Increased exchangeable Pb and carbonate bound
Pb, as well as decreased Fe-Mn oxide Pb were observed for each soil
layer after the addition of NTA. Increased Pb availability were
observed, and the greatest Pb availability was found in 15-20 cm soil
layer. A very low Pb leached from 0-20 cm to 20-40 cm, and no
significant changes were observed for soil Pb fractions after NTA
addition. NTA addition will not cause secondary pollution of Pb in soils
based on a further assessment. Soil respiration and microbial biomass in
rhizosphere soils of <i>A. wardii</i> was inhibited after the addition of
NTA; however, increased exudation of dissolved organic matter and soil
enzyme activities, including urease, acid phosphatase and catalase, were
observed in rhizosphere soils of <i>A. wardii</i>. These in turn may help
alleviate Pb biotoxicity to rhizosphere environment and plants, and also
show great benefit for enhancing Pb accumulation in roots of <i>A.
wardii</i>. Thus, the addition of 2 mmol NTA kg<sup>-1</sup> for 7 days shows great
advantages and practicality on the phytostabilization of Pb contaminated
soils by <i>A. wardii</i>.

<p style=text-align:justify>It is well known the existence of ~1,350,000 hectares of land in Europe
deemed less favourable for conventional agriculture. This land has been
either abandoned because of its productivity, or it is used as
grassland. Nowadays, these soils are identified as “marginal lands”.
Contaminated and degraded soils, such as trace element (TE) contaminated
sites, are also included in the classification of marginal lands. Faced
with this situation, biofertilization seems to be one of the ways to
overcome the problem. It consists in improving the soil properties by
inoculation of biological species (earthworms, termites, fungus, and
microorganism) in soils, in order to promote the recycling of nutrients,
and to quantify the positive and negative externalities induced by this
practice on the development of non-food biomass crops. The aim of the
present study was to assess the effects of exposition of earthworms to a
TE contaminated site. In a microcosm experiment, under controlled
conditions, two species of earthworms, <i>Eisenia Fetida</i> (as required for
the ISO regulation) and <i>Aporrectodea caliginosa</i> (an ubiquitously
species), were exposed to a Cd, Zn, Cu contaminated soil (Chanteloup les
Vignes, France) during 14 days. For each species, 5 replicates were
established and 5 earthworms per cosm were inoculated. Three different
treatments were established depending on the water holding capacity
(WHC) of the soil: 30, 50 and 70% WHC. Environmental trace element
availability was quantified by measuring TE concentration in soil while
environmental bioavailability was assessed by measuring TE
concentrations in depurated whole earthworm bodies. Finally,
toxicological bioavailability was investigated by measuring earthworm
survival rate (at 7 and 14 days) and body weight changes (at 14 days).
According to the microcosm experiment the results showed that i)
although, the studied soil is not favourable for the <i>E. fetida</i> growth
(loss of body weight ≈ 3.97%), it seems beneficial for <i>A. caliginosa</i>
growth (increase of body weight ≈ 44.11%); ii) soil pH, considered as an
indicator of worm activity, decreased significantly in time (from 7.9 at
initial time to 7.4 at final time). Finally, this study revealed that
<i>A. caliginosa</i> showed a better adaptation to stressful condition, such
as reduced WHC and TE contamination, and it could be considered for <i>in
situ</i> biofertilization trials of marginal lands.

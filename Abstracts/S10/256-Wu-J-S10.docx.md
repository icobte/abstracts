<p style=text-align:justify>Manure application is a common agricultural behavior that not only adds
nutrients to soils for plant growth, but also introduces antibiotics and
antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), posing a potential risk to human
health. To study the spread mechanisms of antibiotics and ARGs in
soil-plant system, especially their interaction, degradation and
transport patterns from soil to plants, a greenhouse pot experiment is
conducting. Six typical plants, including three native plants such as
crabgrass, barnyard grass and green bristlegrass, and three common crops
of lettuce, cabbage and corn, all of which are planted in soil
contaminated with antibiotics from farms. The HPLC-MS-MS and
High-throughput sequencing to be used to determine the concentration of
antibiotics and the abundance and expression of ARGs in soil and plants,
to indicate the degradation and distribution of antibiotic and ARGs in
different soil-plant systems and the relative abundance and expression
levels of ARGs in different plants after harvesting. This study expects
to discuss the interactive behaviors among different
soil-antibiotics/ARGs-plants, and to identify the differences in
migration and transformation level of antibiotics and ARGs between the
long-term and short-term antibiotic-contaminated soil-plant systems, so
as to derive the risks of antibiotics and resistance genes to plants.
These findings may shed light on the mechanisms underlying the spread
and fate of antibiotics and ARGs in manured soil and clue for
phytoremediation of soil contaminated with antibiotics.

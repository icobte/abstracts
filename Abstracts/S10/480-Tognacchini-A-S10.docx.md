<p style=text-align:justify>Being a versatile metal nickel is employed in several industrial
processes, with extensive amounts of industrial nickel-rich wastes
produced worldwide. At present, industrial sludges are to the greatest
extent being landfilled, without any economical or environmental
benefit. The possibility to recover valuable metals from materials that
would otherwise be disposed is of particular interest. Likewise, it is
crucial to develop alternative approaches to reduce the environmental
pressure of nickel related industry and for the green production of
profitable nickel compounds. The existence of nickel hyperaccumulator
plant species offers the possibility to investigate new approaches of
nickel recovery from industrial waste. Hyperaccumulator plants are
capable to accumulate between 0.1 and 3% nickel in their dry biomass and
their application for commercial metal recovery from mineral rich
substrates has been defined as phytomining. At present, phytomining
researches have mainly focused on nickel extraction from naturally
nickel rich soils. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the
possibility of nickel transfer from industrial waste into plants
biomass, to support its recovery from bio-ores. For this purpose, the
nickel hyperaccumulator plant <i>Odontharrena chalcidica</i> (form. <i>Alyssum
murale</i>) has been cultivated on five substrates derived from nickel-rich
galvanic sludge. Different waste materials have been identified from
industries operating in nickel plating processes, containing 80 to 150 g
kg<sup>-1</sup> Ni, and converted into artificial substrates (technosols) to
support plant growth. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted for
three months on five waste-derived substrates and a natural ultramafic
soil control. Fertilized and unfertilized replicates were included to
assess differences in plants biomass and nickel accumulation. Pore water
samples collection was carried out to monitor microelements and
nutrients availability and define possible risk of metal leaching.
Results showed that a nickel content between 1 and 2.5% was achieved in
the dry biomass of the unfertilized <i>O.chalcidica</i>, while lower
concentrations were obtained in the fertilized replicates (up to 2%).
Nickel accumulation from three waste-derived substrates resulted to be
higher or comparable to the control natural soil. Fertilization resulted
to be effective in improving plant biomass for all the matrices,
although due to waste toxicity all the replicates growing on waste
substrates showed a biomass reduction of 20 to 90% compared with the
ultramafic control. The pot experiment results demonstrated the
possibility to transfer nickel from waste-derived technosols into plant
biomass and thus the feasibility of phytomining application on galvanic
sludges. Further studies should focus on improving biomass production
with substrate amelioration aimed at reducing waste phytotoxicity.

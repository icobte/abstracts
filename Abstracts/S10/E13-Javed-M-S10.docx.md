<p style=text-align:justify>Soil cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>) stress adversely affects the plant growth, yield
and physiology. Plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) are able to
improve the plant growth in metal contaminated soils. The objective of
the current study was to evaluate the phytobeneficial and bioremediation
potential of a Cd-tolerant bacterial strain isolated from the wastewater
collection point of Chakera, Faisalabad, Pakistan. The <i>Serratia
marcescens</i> CP-13 was identified through 16S rRNA gene sequence
analysis, exhibited a significant potential for inorganic phosphate
solubilization, indole-3-acetic acid production and
1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid deaminase activity. Afterwards, a
pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of <i>S. marcescens</i>
CP-13 inoculation on spinach growth under Cd stress. The soil was spiked
with Cd at the rates of 0, 5 and 10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and the experiment was
repeated twice. Without inoculation of <i>S. marcescens</i>, Cd stress
significantly reduced the plant biomass as well as the quantity of
proteins and photosynthetic pigments due to enhanced H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, MDA and
impaired nutrient homeostasis. Subsequently, <i>S. marcescens</i> CP-13
increased the plant fresh and dry biomass, plant antioxidation capacity,
whereas it decreased the lipid peroxidation under Cd stress. In
parallel, <i>S. marcescens</i> inoculation conferred the Cd stressed plants
to accumulate higher nutrients (K, Ca, P, Mg, Fe and Mn). In conclusion,
<i>S. marcescens</i> inhibited the uptake of Cd, maintained the optimum level
of nutrients by limiting the lipid peroxidation of plasmalemma and,
thereby, enhanced the growth of <i>S. oleracea</i> under Cd stress. Spinach
plants exhibited lower values of bio-concentration factor and
translocation factor (&lt;1) for Cd under <i>S. marcescens</i> CP-13
inoculation. <i>S. marcescens</i> CP-13 inoculation together with spinach
could be used for phytostabilization of metal-contaminated
rhizosphere/soil colloids.

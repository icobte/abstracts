<p style=text-align:justify>Serpentine soils, developed from ultramafic parent material, are
typically rich in nickel (Ni). Moreover, high chromium (Cr) and cobalt
(Co) concentrations, a Ca/Mg ratio &lt; 1 and a low content of essential
nutrients make these soils unattractive for agriculture. On those
Ni-rich soils, most plant species exclude Ni from their shoots, while a
small group of plants is accumulating extensive Ni concentrations in
their aerial parts without showing any toxicity symptoms. Phytomining is
a novel technology based on the cultivation of metal hyperaccumulator
plants for metal recovery and economic profit. Given the extension of
serpentine areas around the globe and the fact that most known
hyperaccumulators are Ni hyperaccumulators, phytomining research is
focused on the recovery of Ni. However, field studies that demonstrate
the feasibility of phytomining are scarce. In this study the phytomining
efficiency of two Ni hyperaccumulators was tested on field-scale on an
Austrian serpentine soil.

<p style=text-align:justify>The field experiment has been established near Bernstein, Austria
(<i>47,406397 N 16,260334 O</i>) in autumn 2016, consisting of 24 plots of 10
m<sup>2</sup> size. The soil was characterized by a pH of 6.1, a DTPA-extractable
Ni fraction of 38.4 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> and a Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-extractable Ni fraction
of 0.53 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Two Ni-hyperaccumulators were tested: the native
hyperaccumulator <i>Noccaea goesingensis</i> and the Albanian species
<i>Odontarrhena chalcidica</i>. Three months old seedlings of <i>N.
goesingensis</i> were planted in October 2016 and three treatments were
established: control (with 20 cm distance between plants), a high
density treatment (10 cm distance between plants) and an intercropping
treatment with <i>Lotus corniculatus</i>. <i>O. chalcidica</i> was planted in
April 2017 after raising the seedlings 4 months in the greenhouse. A
planting density of 4 plants m<sup>-2</sup> was established for all treatments.
The three treatments consisted of a control, intercropping with <i>L.
corniculatus</i> and the application of elemental sulphur (0.46 g S kg<sup>-1</sup>
soil). All treatments were harvested in September 2017.

<p style=text-align:justify>Biomass production (3.65 t ha<sup>-1</sup>) and Ni accumulation (13.4 g kg<sup>-1</sup>)
was highest for <i>O. chalcidica</i>, resulting in a Ni yield of on average
49.2 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> on the control plots. In comparison, <i>N. goesingensis</i>
produced a biomass of 2.47 t ha<sup>-1</sup> and accumulated 7.62 g kg<sup>-1</sup> Ni,
which resulted in a Ni yield of on average 23.8 kg ha<sup>-1</sup> on the control
plots. Intercropping with <i>L. corniculatus</i> affected the biomass
production of both species negatively and the shoot biomass was
significantly lower on the intercropping plots of <i>N. goesingensis</i>
compared to the control. High density planting of <i>N. goesingensis</i> and
sulphur application to <i>O. chalcidica</i> plots had no influence on the Ni
yield. Hyperaccumulator growth led to a decrease of DTPA-extractable Ni
and to an increase of soil pH, with the exception of sulphur-amended
plots.

<p style=text-align:justify>On the tested site, Ni phytomining was most successful with <i>O.
chalcidica</i>. In future experiments different fertilisation regimes and
other promising plant species will be tested in order to optimise plant
growth and Ni yield.

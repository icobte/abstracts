<p style=text-align:justify><i>Phytolacca americana</i> is a high-biomass rare earth element (REE)
hyperaccumulator, which accumulates more than 0.2% REEs (dry biomass) in
the shoots. Previous studies found that <i>P. americana</i> could grow on ion-adsorption
REE mine area of Southern China, and therefore could be a potential
candidate for phytoremediation of REE mine wastelands and agromining of
REEs. However, the ionic REE tailings are characterized by extremely low
content of organic matter and nutrients, which markedly limits the
development of <i>P. americana</i>. Therefore the soil properties should be
improved (<i>e.g.</i> addition of soil amendments) prior to implementing
agromining. On the other hand, the addition of amendments risks to
decrease REE availability and uptake by <i>P. americana</i>. So there is a
need to investigate the type and dosage of amendments to optimize the
plant performance and agromining efficiency.

<p style=text-align:justify>In this study, a pot experiment was carried out with <i>P. americana</i>
planted in REE tailings amended with organic fertilizer or biochar at
different dosages (1.0% and 5.0%, w/w). For each treatment, a control
without plant was also set up.

<p style=text-align:justify>The preliminary results showed that: 1) The biomass of <i>P. americana</i>
was significantly increased by the addition of amendments, the dosage of
5% showing the best effect. Compared to the non-amended treatments, the
addition of organic fertilizer and biochar increased the total biomass
by 7-13 times and 6-9 times. 2) After adding amendments, the pH in the
soil showed a significant increase regardless of the presence or absence
of plants, which improved the soil acid environment and significantly
increased the germination rate of the <i>P. americana</i>. 3) The activity of
urease and acid phosphatase significantly enhanced in REE tailings
amended with organic fertilizer; however, the addition of 1% biochar had
no effect on soil enzyme activity and 5% biochar inhibited them.
Compared to the non-planted treatments, the activity of urease and acid
phosphatase increased significantly after growing <i>P. americana</i> with
different amendments. 4) After amending with 1% biochar, REE
concentrations in the whole plants was 812 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, which was not
significantly different from the non-amended treatments (1089 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>). For the other treatments, REE concentrations were significantly
reduced in <i>P. americana</i> (1% OM, 371 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>; 5% OM, 31 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>; 5%
BC, 374 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>). 5) The total amount of REEs extracted by <i>P.
americana</i> shoots increased significantly (mg pot<sup>-1</sup>) when grown in REE
tailings amended with 1%, 5% biochar and 1% organic fertilizer compared
to non-amended soils. In particular, the yield obtained with 1% biochar
is four times higher than that of non-amended treatment. Currently, the
effects of amendments on the REE availability of the tailing soil are
still under analysis.

<p style=text-align:justify>Nickel phytomining constitutes a green strategy to recover valuable
metals which has been demonstrated in agricultural soils developed over
ultramafic rocks. In Galicia, ultramafic outcrops represent 5 % of the
land surface and several quarrying activities are developed in these
areas, generating large volumes of waste material which is accumulated
in spoil heaps and tailings. The implementation of phytomining in
quarrying-affected areas could provide an additional metal source to
primary ores and, at the same time, reduce hazardous waste volumes and
assist in site rehabilitation. Soils derived from the spoils –
classified as Spolic Technosols – present physical, chemical and
biological deficiencies which limit plant growth and soil functioning.
In this context, we aimed to optimise the conditions for plant growth,
by targeting several aspects: i) the selection of the most adequate
hyperaccumulating plant species, ii) the use of soil amendments to
improve physico-chemical and biological soil properties, iii) the design
of optimal crop patterns and planting densities, and iv) the use of
rhizosphere bacterial strains with plant growth promoting (PGP) traits
and/or which influence Ni uptake by plants.

<p style=text-align:justify>In September 2016, a phytomining field trial was established in a
serpentine quarry (Bandeira, NW Spain) assessing the performance of four
hyperaccumulating plant species (native populations of <i>Noccaea
caerulescens</i> and <i>Odontarrhena serpyllifolia</i> and the Mediterranean
spp. <i>Bornmuellera emarginata</i> and <i>Odontarrhena muralis</i>) under two
regimes of fertilisation (inorganic NPK or composted sewage sludges
(CSS)). After a 10-month growth period, the soil physico-chemical and
biological properties were improved, especially in compost-amended
plots. Nonetheless, further developments of the technique are necessary
to fully optimise plant survival, growth, as well as the Ni yields. In
May 2018, four new blocks were established, which were amended with
different concentrations of CSS (2.5, 5 and 10 %) or distilled grape
bagasse (at 2.5 % w/w). Inorganic NPK fertiliser was employed as control
treatment. Also, the performance of the Mediterranean hyperaccumulator
<i>Bornmuellera tymphaea</i> was evaluated along with those species employed
in the first year of cultivation. Finally, the benefits of inoculating
with the PGP bacterial strain LA44 (<i>Arthrobacter nitroguajacolicus</i>) on
plant growth and Ni accumulation was assessed. Here we present the
results obtained from the second growth season in the field.

<p style=text-align:justify>The production of industrial wastewater is increasing worldwide due to
the drastic advances in production and manufacturing processes. The
adverse industrial activities discharged contaminated wastewater
directly into the water bodies that contain toxic substances such as
heavy metals and metalloids. Due to the continuous use of these
effluents in the agricultural sector may decrease the soil fertility and
crop growth. The mobility and availability of these contaminants affect
their toxicity and biogeochemistry. The present study was conducted to
investigate the toxic effects of marble industrial waste water on <i>Zea
mays</i> L under the exogenous application of citric acid (CA) with
different combinations such as T1; 25 % marble effluent (M.E) diluted
with distilled water, T2; 50% M.E diluted with water, T3; 100% M.E, T4;
citric acid (5mM), T5; 25% M.E + C.A, T6; 50% M.E + C.A, T7; 100% M. E+
C.A. The results showed significant decrease in the growth of <i>Zea mays</i>
with increasing concentration of marble effluent. The maximum reduction
in plant height, root length, number of leaves, leaf area and fresh and
dry biomass of leaf, stem and root was observed at the application of
100% M.E as compared to control. Similar to growth conditions the
photosynthetic machinery (Chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids), gas exchange
attributes (net photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, stomata
conductance, transpiration rate) and the activities of antioxidant
enzymes (SOD, POD, APX, CAT) was also decreased with increasing
concentration of M.E. The application of CA significantly alleviated the
M.E induced toxic effect on Zea mays and ameliorated the growth,
biomass, photosynthesis, gas exchange attributes and antioxidant enzymes
activities by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and electrolyte leakage. The C.A application also enhanced the metal
content and accumulation such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), iron (Fe) in
different parts of <i>Zea mays</i>. The results concluded that the <i>Zea mays</i>
tolerant verities can be the potential candidate for the M.E irrigated
soil and might be suitable for the phyto-extraction of Pb, Cd and Fe.
Future studies are required to investigate the suitability of <i>Zea mays</i>
for the phyto-extraction of heavy metals.

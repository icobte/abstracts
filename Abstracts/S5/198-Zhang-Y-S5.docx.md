<p style="text-align:justify">In recent years, food safety has attracted widespread attention, and
heavy metal exceeding the standard is also an important aspect. <i>Lycium
barbarum</i>, as one of the traditional Chinese medicine and food
homologous plants, is well popular among people. But in its growth
process, there will be heavy metal, pesticide residues and other
pollution. The consumption of wolfberry containing these harmful
substances will pose a great threat to human health, so the content of
heavy metals is one of the important indicators to evaluate the quality
of wolfberry. At present, there are many studies on the heavy metals in
<i>Lycium barbarum</i>, but most of <i>Lycium barbarum</i> not from genuine producing area.
This paper try to determine the concentration of Al element and heavy
metals in <i>Lycium barbarum</i> from
genuine producing area (Zhongning, Ningxia) by ICP-AES method. The contents of Al, Cd, Cu and
Zn in <i>Lycium barbarum L</i>. from genuine producing areas were determined
by wet digestion and ICP-AES. The methodological results showed that the
recoveries of Al and the three heavy metals were Al 46.34%, Cd 84.1%, Cu
70.65% and Zn 92.6%, respectively. The precision was 1.77-3.27. The average
contents (mg/kg) of Al and the three metals in <i>Lycium barbarum</i> were Al
66.18(39.26-114.89),Cd 0.08 (ND-0.18),Cu 7.54 (5.22-12.14)and Zn 19.47
(3.36-62.77),respectively. Compared with the standard values, Cd and Cu
contents in all samples were within the normal range. The Al content in
the sample exceeded the standard value (100mg/kg), and the over-standard
rate was 12.5%. The Zn content in the sample exceeded the standard value
(50mg/kg), and the over-standard rate was 12.5%.

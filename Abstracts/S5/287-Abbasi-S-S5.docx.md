<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic contamination of terrestrial environments has occurred globally
as a result of anthropogenic activities. Remediation of heavy metal
contaminated soil is an expensive process, and awareness of different
factors controlling the levels of risk is needed to improve risk
assessments and inform remediation efforts. The residence time of
contaminants in soil or ‘ageing’ (e.g. metals and metalloids) is a
factor which generally influences the bioavailability and toxicity of
soil-borne contaminants. Despite As being an important terrestrial
contaminant, the effect of As ageing on phytotoxicity has received
relatively little research. To assess the influence of ageing on As
phytotoxicity, a standard test was conducted to compare the growth rate
of <i>Cucumis sativus L</i>. (cucumber) in with contaminated soil aged for up
to 5 years. Nine different soils with different characteristics were
collected from different states of Australia. Soils were spiked with
different concentrations of As to induce a dose-response curve. Soils
were incubated under aerobic conditions for 0.25 yr for the first As
toxicity test and 5 yr for the second test. Cucumber plants were grown
for 28 days in both experiments and effective As concentration that
inhibits cucumber growth by 10%, and 50% were compared to calculate the
impact of ageing on As phytotoxicity. Ageing for 5 yr significantly
reduced As phytotoxicity relative to soils aged for 0.25 yr by 1.4 to
2.7 fold when expressed on a total As basis. In one soil there was no
increase in EC50 values from ageing from 0.25 to 5 yr. For the dataset
as a whole, ageing from between 0.25 and 5 yr increased the EC50 values
by 1.6 fold. The relatively limited influence of ageing between the two
periods of the current study may indicate that the first three months
are most influential for the ageing of soil-borne As.

<p style="text-align:justify">Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for humans and other
animals, yet approximately one billion people worldwide suffer from Se
deficiency. Rice is a staple food for over half of the world’s
population that is a major dietary source of Se. In paddy soils, rice
roots mainly take up selenite via phosphate transporters and aquaporin.
Se speciation analysis indicated that most of the selenite absorbed by
rice is predominantly transformed into selenomethinone (SeMet) and
retained in roots. However, the mechanism by which SeMet is transported
in plants remains largely unknown. In our study, SeMet uptake was found
to be an energy-dependent symport process involving H<sup>+</sup> transport, with
neutral amino acids strongly inhibiting SeMet uptake. We further
revealed that NRT1.1B, a member of rice peptide transporter (PTR) family
which plays an important role in nitrate uptake and transport in rice,
displays SeMet transport activity in yeast and <i>Xenopus</i> oocyte. The
uptake rate of SeMet in the roots and its accumulation rate in the
shoots of <i>nrt1.1b</i> mutant were significantly repressed. Conversely, the
overexpression of <i>NRT1.1B</i> in rice significantly promoted SeMet
translocation from roots to shoots, resulting in increased Se
concentrations in shoots and rice grains. With vascular-specific
expression of <i>NRT1.1B</i> , the grain Se concentration was 1.83-fold higher
than that of wild type. These results strongly demonstrate that NRT1.1B
holds great potential for the improvement of Se concentrations in grains
by facilitating SeMet translocation, and the findings provide novel
insight into breeding of Se-enriched rice varieties.

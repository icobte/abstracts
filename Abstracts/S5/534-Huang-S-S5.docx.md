<p style="text-align:justify">Silicon (Si) is a beneficial element for rice, a typical Si-accumulating
plant. Si is able to improve nutrient imbalance in rice, but the
underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms for this effect are
poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the interaction
between Si and zinc (Zn) in rice by using a mutant (<i>lsi1</i>) defective in
Si uptake and its wild type (WT, cv. Oochikara) in terms of toxicity and
accumulation. Si did not alleviate high Zn-induced inhibition of root
elongation in both mutant and WT. However, Si supply decreased Zn
concentration in both the roots and shoots of the WT although similar
effect was not observed in the <i>lsi1</i> mutant. The root-to-shoot
translocation and distribution in different leaves of Zn was not altered
by Si in both the WT and <i>lsi1</i> mutant. In the WT, Si supply at 0.2 mM
for 7 days was able to decrease Zn concentration in the roots and
shoots. Furthermore, Si supply with 1 mM for three days was required to
decrease Zn accumulation because one day exposure to 1 mM Si did not
show the effect. Si supply also resulted in decreased Zn in the root
cell sap and xylem sap in the WT, but this effect of Si was not observed
in the mutant. These results indicate that Si and Zn interaction did not
occur in the solution and that high Si accumulation in the shoots is
required to decrease Zn uptake. To confirm this, we performed a
short-term (30 min) uptake experiment with stable isotope <sup>67</sup>Zn. The
results showed that <sup>67</sup>Zn uptake was significantly decreased by Si in
WT, but not in the mutant. Furthermore, pre-treatment with Si also
showed similar effect. When grown in paddy field, <i>lsi1</i> showed higher
Zn concentration in the straw, husk and brown rice than the WT. These
results lead us to propose that some Zn transporter genes involved in Zn
uptake are down-regulated by Si accumulated in the shoots. Further work
on characterization of Zn transporter genes are being undertaken.

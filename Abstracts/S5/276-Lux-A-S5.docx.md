<p style="text-align:justify">The “firewall” system of plant defence in response to various abiotic
stresses is a complex system, with participation of both symplasmic and
apoplasmic components. In many cases, modifications of the cell walls
and intercellular spaces (apoplasm), especially those in the root
peripheral parts (epidermis, cortex), are the key stage in defence
responses. Along the whole plant body there are several checkpoints that
regulate water transport and the movement of solutes, including toxic
metals, metalloids and (potentially toxic) nutrients. Checkpoints are
known at the root surface, starting from the protection of the root
apical meristem by the root cap and the interface between the
rhizodermis/root hairs and the soil. Radial transport across the root is
regulated at the exodermis and endodermis. Suberin, lignin and other
cell wall components occurring in peripheral parts of a root form
barriers preventing uncontrolled movement of solutes, water and gasses.
A further checkpoint is in the transfer from the symplasmic space to the
xylem apoplasmic space. Xylem transport along the plant body is
regulated by checkpoints between lateral roots and the main root, and in
junctions between the root and the stem. Leaf interconnections with the
stem in nodes is another checkpoint in transport processes. The
sporophyte/gametophyte junction and the connection between maternal
tissues and the embryo are the final, and very important, checkpoints in
transport processes.

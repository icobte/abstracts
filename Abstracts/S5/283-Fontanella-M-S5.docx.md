<p style="text-align:justify">Food habits, or more generally food consumption, with special reference
to agro-food products, have always been linked to the territory of
production. The close relationship food-land, stemming from
socio-cultural factors and availability of local resources, has weakened
over time due to globalization, leading to a conformity of eating habits
in all regions. Consumers have shown renewed interest in the
geographical provenience of agro-food products, as result of the
reduction of confidence in the quality and safety of food produced
outside their region, country or even continent. In this context, since
1993, the EU has had a system in place for Protected Geographical
Indications (PGI). In Italy, where the cultivation of lemon is widely
diffused in the south, the <i>“Limone di Sorrento” (Citrus limon</i> (L.)
Burm. f. <i>cv “Ovale di Sorrento”)</i> has been awarded as PGI (with an
annual production of about 1092 tons recorded in 2017) recognizing its
quality and ancient cultural characteristics of cultivation on terraces
overlooking the sea of the Sorrento peninsula. Moreover, the Limone di
Sorrento is known all over the world being the raw material for the
production of the famous “Limoncello di Sorrento” liqueur. Our study is
aimed to apply various analytical methods to assess geographical origin
and authenticity of Sorrento lemon fruits to protect them from frauds
with lemons of other geographical origin. This work reports the content
of 16 trace elements, measured by acid digestion plus ICP-MS, in lemon
juices of “Ovale di Sorrento” collected from three different production
areas of Campania Region and tests the efficacy and robustness of a
chemometric approach of geographic traceability to discriminate the
elemental profiles of “Limone di Sorrento” PGI. The best model,
achieving 100% of correct reclassification, was based on 12 elements
(Ti, V, Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba) showing an optimal
discrimination between the 3 lemon groups with different geographical
provenience. The model was cross-validated with satisfactory results
(97,5% of correct reclassification). The elemental profiles of lemons at
different stages of maturity were assessed. The application of the model
not only for tracing the geographical provenience of lemon fruits but
also for protecting them from frauds (PGI and NO-PGI) is highlighted.
The relationship with the elemental compositions and characteristics of
related soils is also under investigation. Further comparison to
discriminate other lemon fruit cultivars originating from Italy and
other countries are in progress.

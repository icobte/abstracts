<p style="text-align:justify">As one of the most important staple crops, rice not only provides more
than one fifth of daily calories for half of the world’s human
population but is also a major source of mineral nutrients such as Mo,
an essential micronutrient for almost all living organisms. In humans,
Mo is required for the biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor (Moco), which
forms the active site of molybdenum-requiring enzymes (molybdoenzymes)
including aldehyde oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, sulfite oxidase and
amidoxime reducing component. These enzymes participate in crucial
processes such as purine metabolism and sulfite detoxification and play
a vital role in maintaining human healt. Deficiency of Moco biosynthesis
in humans results in the decrease of molybdoenzyme activity, which leads
to inheritable progressive neurological damage and even early childhood
death. However, little is known about the genetic basis of the variation
in Mo content in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) grain. We mapped a
quantitative trait locus (QTL) <i>qGMo8</i> that controls Mo accumulation in
rice grain by using a recombinant inbred line population and a backcross
introgression line population. We identified a molybdate transporter,
<i>OsMOT1;1</i>, as the causal gene for this QTL. OsMOT1;1 exhibits transport
activity for molybdate, but not sulfate, when heterogeneously expressed
in yeast cells. <i>OsMOT1;1</i> is mainly expressed in roots and is involved
in the uptake and translocation of molybdate under molybdate limited
condition. Knock-down of <i>OsMOT1;1</i> results in less Mo being
translocated to shoots, lower Mo concentration in grains and higher
sensitivity to Mo deficiency. We reveal that the natural variation of Mo
concentration in rice grains is attributed to the variable expression of
<i>OsMOT1;1</i> due to sequence variation in its promoter. Identification of
natural allelic variation in <i>OsMOT1;1</i> may facilitate the development
of rice varieties with Mo enriched grain for dietary needs and improve
Mo nutrition of rice on Mo-deficient soils.

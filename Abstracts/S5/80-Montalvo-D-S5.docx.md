<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium (Cd) is a non-essential toxic trace metal that can be readily
taken up by plant roots and accumulate in above-ground tissue. Recent
studies have reported high levels of Cd in cacao (<i>Theobroma cacao</i> L.)
beans from Ecuador (average 0.9 mg Cd kg<sup>-1</sup> bean), which has raised
concerns on its future trade due to difficulties to comply with food
safety regulations. The problem of high Cd concentrations in cacao beans
from Ecuador is unrelated to point pollution but a geogenic one,
combined with cacao being a plant with high affinity for Cd uptake (Cd
accumulator). Managing Cd in cacao requires an understanding of the
processes affecting soil Cd bioavailability. Soil factors such as total
Cd, pH and organic carbon content are the main factors explaining Cd
concentration in cacao beans. Since cacao is a perennial crop with
deep-rooted soil horizons it is important to understand the
functionality of the root structures on Cd uptake. Here we hypothesized
that the origin of shoot Cd in cacao is affected by the distribution of
roots in the soil and bioavailable Cd. A pot experiment with cacao
seedlings was conducted to better understand and quantify the
contribution of rooted soil compartments (top-or bottom soil) on the
concentration of Cd in cacao leaves using <sup>108</sup>Cd as a tracer. Pots
contained superimposed soils (top and bottom) that differed in Cd
availability either by liming (soil pH raised from 5.6 to 6.5) or by
using soils with contrasting properties (surface soil with high Cd and
subsurface soil low Cd) to evaluate its effect on Cd source
apportionment. The first new leaf on each plant was harvested after 7
weeks of growth and <sup>108</sup>Cd and <sup>111</sup>Cd were measured by ICP-MS after
nitric acid digestion. Results showed that 57% of Cd in the shoot was
derived from the top soil compartment in plants grown in fully non-limed
soils. When only the top compartment soil was limed, the majority (67%)
of Cd in the shoot derived from the bottom compartment soil. By liming
top and bottom soils, 68% of Cd in the shoot derived from the top
compartment. In plants grown in two contrasting soils (surface over
subsoil), about 60% of Cd in the shoot was derived from the top
compartment and this fraction was observed independently if the surface
top soil was limed. In contrasting soils, Cd in the shoot significantly
reduced by a factor 2 when top soil was limed. Surprisingly, no
significant difference in shoot Cd was observed in plants grown in
surface soil with or without liming. At the conference results from 4
months growth will be presented and will be discussed with root biomass
of the plants.

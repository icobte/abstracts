<p style="text-align:justify">Many trace metals are essential micronutrients, and all of them can
become toxic when they become bioavailable in excess. Bioavailable
concentrations of trace metals in the environment and agriculture are
vastly different (with natural and anthropogenic causes) in various
habitats, ranging from deficient to toxic levels. Therefore, research
has focused on response to trace metals by plants and photosynthetic
model organisms (algae and bacteria) in terms of uptake, transport,
sequestration, speciation, deficiency, toxicity and detoxification. Most
early and even numerous recent studies have used environmentally not
relevant conditions. This applies in particular to extremely high,
environmentally and agriculturally not relevant concentrations of toxic
metals and metalloids. Further, individual processes often were not
mechanistically interconnected, so that causes and consequences of
metal(loid) effects remained unclear. In this contribution, recent
insights are shown, mostly in the (sub-)nanomolar range of metal
concentrations, with a simulation of natural light- and temperature
cycles and trying to interconnect individual effects. The submerged
rootless water plant <i>Ceratophyllum demersum</i> turned out to be a useful
shoot model, allowing to assess effects on photosynthetic tissues
without interaction with root toxicity. In this model it could be shown
that metal(loid) (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni) concentrations that were
previously considered as not having any effect actually have a strong
impact on the plants, and with a different sequence of events than
observed at very high concentrations. In addition, Soybean (<i>Glycine
max</i>) was used as a model for terrestrial plants and crops. We used a
combination of various biophysical and biochemical methods for
measurements in vivo (e.g. photosynthesis biophysics, formation of
reactive oxygen species, metal transport), in situ (e.g. quantitative
(sub)cellular distribution and speciation of metals, mRNA levels) as
well as on isolated proteins (for identification and characterization of
metalloproteins) and metabolites (metabolomics). For example, using
metalloproteomics via HPLC-ICPMS of protein extracts from stressed
plants, changes in target sites of metal binding to proteins from
deficient to toxic concentrations could be analyzed. X-ray absorption
(XANES) and fluorescence (µXRF) provided information about metal(loid)
speciation and distribution. The combination of techniques clearly
showed metal(loid)-induced changes in the metabolism, already at very
low concentrations, and allowed for new insights into the mechanisms of
sublethal toxicity of As, Cd and Cu.

<p style="text-align:justify">GPGV (Grapevine Pinot Gris virus) is a recently-identified grapevine
disease which causes significant damages in some white-berry grapevine
cultivars. Some authors have argued that Boron deficiency or sub-optimal
content of this essential element could trigger the outbreak of
symptoms. This hypothesis was supported by experiments carried out in
hydroponics, where GPGV symptoms were evident only when grapevines were
grown in boron-limited solutions. We hypothesized that a high content of
B in the vine could suppress the symptoms and thus negative effects of
GPGV in vineyard. We also wanted to check whether toxic effects could
occur when exceeding maximum recommended dose of B per hectare by foliar
spray.

<p style="text-align:justify">To test efficacy of B fertilization in increasing B content in vines, an
agronomic trial (3 randomized blocks) was set-up in a vineyard grown
with “Friulano” cultivar, located in “Villanova” Farm, (Farra d’Isonzo,
Northeastern Italy; 45°54’59,5” N; 13°31’51,5” E) in 2018. Treatments
were four: 1- control; 2- soil B fertilization (2 times); 3-foliar B
fertilization (10 times), 4- foliar (10 times) plus soil (2 times) B
fertilization; in all cases B was supplied as a complex with
ethanolamine. Before each foliar administration, and after the last one,
5 leaves were sampled from each plot and analysed for their B content as
well as for other mineral nutrients (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P and
Zn). Soil samples were taken for B quantitation before each
fertilization and after second fertilization. Buds were taken in early
November (one bud per vine) to be analysed as for the leaves.

<p style="text-align:justify">Foliar treatments (3 and 4) promptly increased boron content in leaves
compared to control; by contrast foliar B concentration increased
slightly when this element was added to soil (treatment 2). B
concentration in buds taken from soil only fertilization (treatment 2)
was not different from control; foliar treatments (3 and 4) were both
statistically higher compared to control and not statistically different
among them.

<p style="text-align:justify">No visual reduction of GPGV symptoms were noticed during the season as a
consequence of any B fertilization treatment. However, because B
reserves in plant are important at sprouting, both visual and B content
monitoring will be performed in 2019 growing season.

<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Dicranopteris linearis</i> is a fern that accumulates unusually high
concentrations (up to 0.3% dry weight) of rare earth elements (REEs) in
China. Previously, we reported that <i>D. linearis</i> accumulates high
concentration of aluminium (Al) and silicon (Si) in the fronds, but the
interactions between these elements and REEs are unknown. In this study,
a range of analytical techniques, including extractions,
Scanning-Electron Microscopy with Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy
(SEM-EDS) and Particle Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE) were used to study
the associations of REEs with Al and Si. The results showed that <i>D.
linearis</i> accumulated high concentrations of REEs (up to 3830 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>), Al (up to 9660 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and Si (up to 20 300 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), with
concentrations increasing with the age and the frond order of the pinna.
The PIXE analysis revealed that REEs (<i>e.g.</i> La & Ce) were highly
concentrated within the veins and necrosis of the pinnules, which were
probably induced by manganese toxicity. While Al and Si were more
concentrated at the margins of the pinnules. The PIXE analysis also
revealed that REEs, Al and Si were co-localized at the xylem and
pericycle (cell walls) of the stolon, petiole and midvein
cross-sections, the epidermis especially the upper epidermis of the
pinnule cross-section. The extraction patterns suggested the existence
of REEs-Si and Al-Si complexes in the fronds. The SEM-EDS analysis
confirmed the existence of aluminosilicate deposits in the protoplast
and apoplast of the pinna cells, and cell walls of the pericycles of the
vascular system. We speculate that REEs, Al and Si were co-existing
within the solutes of the transpiration flow, and then, some of which
were carried to the blades and co-deposited at the epidermis and
necrosis, and some that did not translocate out were co-deposited at the
pericycle. Overall, our results show that REEs/Al-Si co-depositions are
involved in detoxifying the excess REEs and Al in <i>D. linearis</i> frond.

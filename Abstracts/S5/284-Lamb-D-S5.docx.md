<p style="text-align:justify">The toxicity of metals and metalloids is well known to depend strongly
on speciation in the environment. This is particularly evident in the
case of chromium. Chromium (III) is generally an essential nutrient (at
low concentrations), whilst the Cr(VI) oxidation state is highly toxic
and carcinogenic in humans. Whilst Cr(VI) is well recognized to be
highly toxic to a range biota, there is relatively little available data
enabling modelling of the terrestrial ecotoxicity of Cr as influenced by
environmental factors, such as pH and ionic compositoin of pore-waters.
The absorption and toxicity of metallic cations and anions are
influenced by the presence of potentially competiting ions, such as
calcium and phosphate. A series of models have been proposed accounting
for such interactions in the bathing solution around biological
membranes. These models include the windermere humic acid model (WHAM),
electrostatic and the biotic ligand models (BLM). These models deal
almost exclusively with cationic metals such as nickel, copper and zinc
and have exluded metallic anions such as arsenate and chromate. In the
case of Cr(III), BLM models have been reported in plants and could also
potentially be modelled using WHAM. However, the more environmentally
concerning Cr(VI) has scarcely been investigated, both in terms of soil
solution impacts on phytotoxicity, but also, the development of BLM
modelling parameters. In this study, we developed a terrestrial BLM-like
model for chromate in soil solution using 10 contrasting soils with a
range of pH, bicarbonate, sulphate and phosphate concentrations using
<i>Cucumis sativa</i> L.. Plants were exposed to soils with increasing Cr(VI) using a 28 day assay. Soil solution was sampled with Rhizon
samplers and chromium speciation determined using liquid chromatography
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results showed that
unlike previously reported studies, there was no clear interaction with
sulphate or phosphate with chromate toxicity. However, there was a clear
interaction between OH<sup>-</sup> and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup><sub>.</sub> Therefore, we successfully
developed a BLM-like model for chromate which was a function of OH<sup>-</sup>
and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> activities (a root mean squre error of 19.4%). The nature
of the interaction between chromate and OH<sup>-</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> has implications
for intepretation of BLM models, particularly relating to other metallic
anions.

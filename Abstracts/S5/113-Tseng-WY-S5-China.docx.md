<p style="text-align:justify">Heavy metal pollution in farmland soil represents a problem for crops
growth and food safety. Among these heavy metals, cadmium transfers to
the edible part of plant through rootâ€™s uptake readily. The different
chemical forms of cadmium in the roots of plants also make different
mobility and thus the upward translocation. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effect of chemical forms of cadmium in root on the
concentration of cadmium in shoot in three species of leafy vegetables
and five cultivars per species. Experimental result revealed that most
of the cadmium accumulated in the root was in the inorganic form and
followed by water-soluble and organic forms. The cultivars with high
percentage of inorganic and water-soluble chemical forms of cadmium in
root, which have high mobility show a high total cadmium concentration
in the edible parts. While compartmentalized primary in the undissolved
phosphate, oxalate, and residual forms, by contrast, have lower
concentration of accumulated cadmium.

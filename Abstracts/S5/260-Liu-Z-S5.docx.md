<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium (Cd) is an important heavy metal pollutant
in farmland soils due to various anthropogenic activities, such as
utilization of chemical fertilizers, wastewater irrigation, and sewage
sludge, large areas of cultivated soils worldwide have been contaminated
by Cd, in the past decades. Cd inhibits physiological processes and
normal growth and reduces the biomass and yield of plants. Therefore, it
is of great urgency to explore new ways for reducing the Cd content in
the cultivated soils. The results from few existing studies on the
effects of sulfate supply on Cd availability in soil are conflicting. In
order to investigate the effect of sulfate on the migration and
transformation of cadmium（Cd）in soil system, sufficient sulfate were
applied to the two levels exogenous Cd-contaminated soil, soil solution
was collected during four months soil culture test, and measuring pH,
conductivity, cadmium content and other indicators of soil solution. The
effect of sulfate on the mobility and bioavailability of Cd was
examined.

<p style="text-align:justify">The results showed that flooded environment played an important role in
affecting the mobility of Cd in soil solution, the availability of
cadmium in the soil increased firstly and then decreased. Long-term
flooding could increase the pH of the soil and reduce the conductivity
of the soil. The content of cadmium in alkaline soil was generally lower
than that in acid soil during the first three months, and the content of
cadmium in acid soil after flooding and adding sulfate is effectively
reduced to the same level as alkaline soil at the fourth month. The
addition of sulfate reduced the availability of cadmium in alkaline
soil, which is on the contrary in acid soils. After comparison, flooding
conditions played a greater role in reducing the cadmium content in soil
solution than the addition of sulfate. The mechanism behind these
phenomena needs to be further explored.

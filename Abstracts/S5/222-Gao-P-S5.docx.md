<p style="text-align:justify">As the biggest freshwater wetland in North China, Baiyangdian Lake is
facing the problems of eutrophication and sediment contamination by
heavy metals especially for Pb and Cd. Submerged macrophyte has shown
tremendous potential to remove pollutants from water. In addition, since
submerged plants are exposed to both overlying water and sediment, the
translocation of metals in plants can affect their biogeochemical cycle
in water system. However, there is little information available on the
influences of N and P, which are the key limiting nutrients in
eutrophication, on heavy metal translocation in submerged plants. As a
result, effects of N and P nutrient on Pb translocation and accumulation
in submerged macrophyte <i>Potamogeton crispus</i> L. were investigated. Root
of <i>P. crispus</i> were exposed to 50 mg/kg Pb contaminated sediment with
different N (NH<sub>4</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>) and P (KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) concentrations (N 0.5 g/kg,
N 5 g/kg, N0.5+P0.5 g/kg, N 5+P5 g/kg) to explore the influence of
macronutrient on Pb translocation and accumulation of Pb in sediment-
submerged plant-water system using the sequestered chamber.

<p style="text-align:justify">Results showed that Pb accumulation in plants decreased in the order of
leaves&gt;stems&gt;roots. N addition in sediment showed no significant
influence on Pb accumulation in roots, while promoted upward
translocation of Pb, with translocation factor (TF) of N 0.5 and N 5
treatment increased by 36.76% and 17.48%, respectively, compared with
that of control treatment (CK, without N and P). Therefore,
bioaccumulation of Pb in shoot was enhanced after N addition in
sediment. Bioaccumulation factor (BCF) of Pb in shoot of <i>P. Crispus</i> of
N 0.5 and N 5 treatment was 36.76% and 17.48% higher than that of CK,
respectively. Furthermore, after P addition in sediment, Pb accumulation
in plants were significantly inhibited compared with single N treatment
probably due to the immobilization of Pb by P in sediment. Pb
concentrations in plant roots of N0.5+P0.5 and N5+P5 treatment was
reduced by 82% and 85% compared with that of N0.5 and N 5 treatment,
respectively. However, P in sediment inhibited translocation of Pb from
root to shoot, TF of N0.5+P0.5 and N5+P5 treatment was reduced by 12%
and 38% compared with that of N0.5 and N 5 treatment, respectively. The
TF was &gt;1 in all conditions, indicating that <i>P. crispus</i> promotes
the translocation of Pb to shoots, while it was more obvious after
adding P in sediment.On the basis of this experiment, the translocation
and accumulation of Pb by <i>P. crispus</i> is affected by nitrogen and
phosphate, and therefore, it can be a good candidate for the
phytofiltration of this contaminant in different trophic level sediment.

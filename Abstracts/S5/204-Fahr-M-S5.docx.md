<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Hirschfeldia incana,</i> is a pseudometallophyte belonging to the
<i>Brassicaceae</i> family, widespread in the Mediterranean region and a
medium perennial shrub. This plant has good ability to grow on soils
contaminated by lead (Pb). We used <i>Hirschfeldia incana</i> as a model for
molecular characterization of Pb tolerance and accumulation in plants.

<p style="text-align:justify">Microarrays comparison of gene expression between <i>H. incana</i> and a
susceptible plant to Pb <i>(Arabidopsis thaliana)</i> , enabled the
identification of a set of specific genes expressed in response to lead
exposure. The number of genes specifically regulated by Pb in <i>H.
incana</i> was higher in shoots than in roots, with 602 and 341 genes,
respectively. Four groups of genes were particularly over-represented
due to the Pb exposure and are categorized into biological processes as
photosynthesis, cell wall, transport and metal handling.

<p style="text-align:justify">Expression profile of a subset of differentially regulated genes
involved specifically in transport and metal handling was also checked
by qRT-PCR in <i>H. incana.</i> 

<p style="text-align:justify">Our results suggest a possible scenario of Pb tolerance and accumulation
mechanisms in <i>H. incana</i>. In roots, Pb is probably chelated with
defensins at the cytosol level and interact with membrane transporters.
Then, HMA4 a P-type ATPase transporter may play a role in Pb
translocation to aerial parts through the xylem. Once in the leaves,
ferritin and Metalothinein can play an essential role in Pb distribution
in leaves and Pb binding and sequestration in cells. MRP14 transporter
can be involved in the Pb storage in the vacuoles probably in a
conjugate form (glutathione-Pb). Another transporter, GCN2 from the ABCF
family, can contributed in Pb storage in chloroplast.

<p style="text-align:justify">This study provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Pb
tolerance and accumulation in plants and opens new ways for the study
and the selection of heavy metals tolerant plants.

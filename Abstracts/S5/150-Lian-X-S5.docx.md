<p style="text-align:justify">The acquisition of mineral elements from the soil and their distribution
within plant tissues are important physiological and biochemical
processes essential for plant growth and development. Cereals such as
rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) are also an important dietary source of both the
essential micronutrients (e.g. iron and zinc) and the toxic trace
elements (e.g. cadmium and arsenic) to humans. The genetic basis
underlying the natural variations in the mineral composition, the
ionome, in rice remains largely unknown. Here, we describe a
comprehensive study of the genetic architecture of the variation in rice
ionome performed using genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of the
concentrations of 17 mineral elements in rice grain from a diverse panel
of 529 accessions, each genotyped at approximately 6.4 million SNP loci.
We identified 72 loci associated with natural ionomic variations,
including 32 that are common across locations and 40 that are common
within a single location. We identified candidate genes for 42 loci and
provide evidence for the causal nature of three genes, the sodium
transporter gene Os-<i>HKT1;5</i> for sodium, Os-<i>MOLYBDATE TRANSPORTER1;1</i> 
for molybdenum and <i>Grain Number</i>, <i>Plant Height</i>, and <i>Heading Date 7</i> 
for nitrogen. Comparison of GWAS data from rice vs. <i>Arabidopsis
thaliana</i> also identified well-known as well as new candidates with
potential for further characterization. Our study provides crucial
insights into the genetic basis of ionomic variations in rice and serves
as an important foundation for further studies on the genetic and
molecular mechanisms controlling the rice ionome.

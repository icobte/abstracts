<p style="text-align:justify">Pak choi (<i>Brassica chinensis</i>) is a vastly consumed leafy vegetable in
China, yet it is also a potential accumulator for cadmium (Cd).
Therefore, it is of great urgency to reduce the Cd content in the edible
part of the pak choi. There have been numerous reports of selenium (Se)
regulating Cd accumulation in plants; however, considering the different
experimental conditions, the results are now paradoxical, and the
underling mechanisms remain unclear. Some researchers attributed such Se
effects to the complexation between selenocompounds and Cd because of
the chemical similarity between Se and sulfur (S). This study
investigated Se transformation and how Se species affected Cd
accumulation in pak choi exposed to either of selenite and selenate for
different times under hydroponic conditions.

<p style="text-align:justify">The addition of both Se forms insignificantly increased the Cd content
in shoots with 1 h of exposure before a gradually enhanced reducing
effect of selenite was observed. The selenite-induced reduction was
maintained comparable after 72 h, and became significant after 96 h; the
differences were 4% and 30% at 24 and 168 h, respectively, compared to
the Cd content in shoots treated with only Cd. On the other hand, there
was no significant in the Cd content between the selenate and Cd alone
treatments at any time. Nonetheless, selenate enhanced Cd accumulation
in shoots by approximately 1/4 at both 72 and 96 h, and began to dismiss
it by no more than 1/5 after 120 h of exposure, which was 2 d later than
selenite did.

<p style="text-align:justify">Five Se species were discovered in pak choi; because of the distinct
accumulation capacity of selenite and selenate, the total Se content and
that of every Se species in selenate-treated plants were much higher
than those in selenite-treated ones. However, after 24 h, organic Se
such as selenomethionine (SeMet) and <i>Se</i>-methylselenocysteine (SeMeCys)
accounted for roughly 3/5 in shoots and 9/10 in roots of
selenite-treated plants, which were much higher than those in
selenate-treated plants where SeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> was of 70% in shoots and 30% in
roots. A substantial increase in proportions of organic Se species and a
sharp decline in that of SeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> were found under both Se treatments,
and Se transformation into seleno amino acids was in accordance with the
dynamics of Se affecting Cd accumulation in the shoot.

<p style="text-align:justify">In conclusion, Se could reduce Cd accumulation in the edible part of pak
choi after certain times; the selenate-induced reduction was exhibited
much later and less significant than the selenite-induced one. The
different effects of the two Se forms applied should be attributed to
their transformation in the plant. Most of the selenate taken up
remained as SeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, whereas selenite in the plant was readily
assimilated to seleno amino acids; SeMet was invariably the dominant
organic species whose content showed the greatest increase among those
of the five species detected over the exposure times. Hence, Se effects
on Cd accumulation could depend on the exposure times, where SeMet and
SeO<sub>4</sub><sup>2Â­-</sup> contents, their relative proportions, and Se transformation
were also involved in the Se-mediated regulation.

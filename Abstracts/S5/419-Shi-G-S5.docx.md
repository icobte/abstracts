<p style="text-align:justify">Two wheat (<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) cultivars
differing in As-tolerance were used to investigate the effects of
phosphorus (P) concentration and nutrient solution pH on As(V) toxicity
and As(V) uptake kinetics, and to illustrate the mechanism of As(V)
tolerance in wheat seedlings. Low pH and low phosphate concentration
enhanced wheat uptake of As, resulting in high As toxicity. The
As(V)-tolerant cultivar MM45 exhibited higher relative root elongation
than non-tolerant cultivar HM29 in all treatments, except that no
genotypic difference was recorded for the solution P at 100 µmol L<sup>–1</sup>
or greater. Wheat seedling As(V) tolerance was positively correlated
with P concentration in roots and shoots. In short-term (30 min)
As(V)-uptake kinetics experiments, the maximum influx rate (<i>V<sub>max</sub></i>) of
As(V) increased with decreasing solution pH (from 7.0 to 6.0). Compared
with HM29, although MM45 had lower <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> , its Michaelis–Menten
constant (<i>K<sub>m</sub></i>) did not exceed that of HM29 in any of the treatments.
The <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> values of both cultivars were not significantly affected by
phosphate treatments, except for HM29 which had significantly higher
<i>V<sub>max</sub></i> value in the presence of phosphate at pH 7.0. The <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> values
of the two cultivars increased by 9- to 20-fold when phosphate was
present as opposed to absent from the uptake solution. This study showed
that the <i>V<sub>max</sub></i> values are mainly increased by high pH and As(V)
uptake <i>K<sub>m</sub></i> is mainly increased by phosphate presence. Decreased As(V)
influx rates during early stages and increased P concentration in plant
tissues are associated with increased As tolerance in wheat seedlings.

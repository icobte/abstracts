<p style="text-align:justify">Numerous genes in plants control the uptake, translocation, and storage
of elements, including the essential macro- and micro-nutrients and the
various non-essential elements. However, few genes have been identified
due to a lack of efficient method to screen libraries of mutated plants
for individuals which have unusual characteristics in metal uptake and
distribution. Screening requires the analysis of thousands of randomly
mutated plants, but most techniques for quantifying metals are poorly
suited for high-throughput analysis of large populations. Inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) allows for quantitative and
simultaneous measurement of a range of elements and is useful for
determining the metal concentration in whole plants or organs, but it
lacks spatial resolution. Identification of the spatial distribution of
metals in specific tissues and organs would be more useful for the
identification of unusual individuals. In addition, ICP-MS analyses are
destructive and requires a comparatively large amount of work to prepare
samples (e.g. grinding, acid digestion), especially when used for
thousands of mutated plants. With the development of a new generation of
fast fluorescence detector systems, synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence
microscopy (µ-XRF) provides a unique capability of obtaining the
elemental distribution in vivo with minimal sample preparation, and
importantly it is a rapid, sensitive and non-destructive method. In this
study, we develop µ-XRF as a high-throughput method to screen mutant
libraries of rice and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> seed with the phenotype of
altered metal accumulation / distribution in whole intact seeds. This is
particularly important in plant biology given that the identification of
genes involved in metal metabolism requires the ‘screening’ of thousands
of genetic variants. Once identified, the casual gene(s) responsible for
the phenotype will be further investigated using genetic and molecular
biology methods.

<p style="text-align:justify">Effect of Mexican sunflower compost (MSC) and Cassava peel compost (CPC)
applied at 0, 20 and 40t/ha and plant age on heavy metal (Zn, Pb, Cd and
Cr ) uptake by maize crop grown on heavy metal contaminated soil was
assessed. Inorganic fertilizer (NPK; 20:10:10) at 100 kgN/ha and compost
at 0 t/ha served as checks. Maize plants were analysed for Zn, Pb, Cd
and Cr concentrations at one and two month(s) after planting (i.e 1MAP,
2MAP) and at harvesting. Results showed that maize plant accumulated
more Pb than other metals while Cr was least accumulated and was only
detected in the root of the harvested maize plants. Control plants had
the highest concentrations of all these metals at 1MAP and 2MAP compared
to compost treatments. The metal concentration in the root was generally
higher than that of the shoot. Though, there was no plant from the
control plots, but MSC compost application reduced the Pb concentration
in maize seeds; MSC20 (152 mg/kg) and MSC40 (174 mg/kg), compared to CPC
treatments. Unlike what was observed for the Pb distribution, Cd
concentrations in the leaves of maize crops from compost treatments
(MSC20, MSC40 and CPC40) were more than those of the roots, though
reduced at 2MAP. Zinc mobility to the leaf at IMAP was lower than that
of 2MAP, especially in the MSC compost treatments. Cr mobility to the
above ground parts was restricted with compost application compared to
control and F1 treatments and was not detected in the above ground parts
at harvesting and was only detected in the root of maize plant from
CPC20 treatment. Metal concentration and distribution in plant was found
to depend on the type, maize growth stage and soil nutrient levels.
Amendment with compost enhanced maize growth and reduced heavy metal
accumulation by maize crop.

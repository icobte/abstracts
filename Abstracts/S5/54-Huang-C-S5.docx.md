<p style="text-align:justify">Manganese (Mn), an essential micronutrient, acts as a cofactor involved
in multiple biological processes including photosynthesis, lipid
biosynthesis and oxidative stress in plants. Natural
Resistance-Associated Macrophage Proteins (NRAMPs) comprise a family
that is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to human beings and acts
as proton/metal symporters that are able to transport a broad range of
metals, including Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup>. NRAMP1 is a root
high-affinity transporter for Mn uptake in Arabidopsis. Mutation of
<i>NRAMP1</i> impairs root growth under Mn deficient conditions. To identify
additional genes required for Mn uptake and transport, we carried out a
forward genetic screen on an EMS-mutagenized population in the <i>nramp1</i> 
background in <i>Arabidopsis</i>. Through the screening for mutants that are
sensitive to low Mn, we identified a mutant showing Mn-dependent short
root growth. Gene cloning led to the identification of the responsible
gene <i>NRAMP2</i> that could complement the defective root growth in the
mutant under Mn deficiency. Our results reveal that under Mn deficient
conditions, increased accumulation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is partially responsible
for the root growth inhibition and that NRAMP2 is a Mn transporter
localized in the trans-Golgi network and is involved in remobilization
of Mn in Golgi for root growth. Overexpression of <i>NRAMP2</i> improved plant
growth at Mn-deficient conditions.

<p style="text-align:justify">Besides NRAMP1 and NRAMP2, we found that NRAMP6 is also required for
sustaining root growth at low Mn conditions. Although <i>NRAMP6</i> was
expressed in roots at a low level, NRAMP6 plays an unequal redundant
role with NRAMP1 to be involved in the regulation of root growth and Mn
translocation from roots to shoots under Mn deficient conditions.
Overexpression of <i>NRAMP6</i> improves root growth at low Mn conditions.
Crops such as wheat and barley are prone to experience Mn deficiency
when they are grown on high pH and low water content soils that are
prevalent in northern parts of Europe, USA and China. Therefore, our
results suggest a way to improve crop growth under Mn deficient
conditions through manipulation of NRAMP2 and NRAMP6.

<p style="text-align:justify">For more than twenty years, nanotechnologies have seen exponential
growth in use and are now found in nearly all sectors. Carbon nanotubes
(CNTs) are one of the most widely used nanomaterials due to their unique
optical, mechanical, electrical and thermal properties. CNTs may be
released into the environment during production, use, destruction, reuse
or potential accidents such as spills. Plants are important potential
receptors given that they are at the base of the food chain and can be
particularly impacted by multiple exposure routes as they are at the
interface between three environmental compartments; air, soil and water.

<p style="text-align:justify">CNTs can be described as seamless rolled layers of graphene forming
nanotubes. CNTs can be formed of one layer (Single Walled CNTs), two
layers (Double Walled CNTs) or more (Multi Walled CNTs). Accordingly,
their diameter can vary from below 1 to <i>ca.</i> 100 nm. Their length can
also differ (from &lt;1 to 100 microns or even more). Finally, CNTs can
be functionalized by attaching chemical groups to their surface. These
different parameters can modify their properties and their interactions
in the environment. In “safer by design” production, it is important to
understand how different CNT physico-chemical parameters will influence
their behaviour and their impacts on ecosystems. In this study, we
tested the influence of CNT functionalization, length and outer diameter
on their impacts on the crop plant canola.

<p style="text-align:justify">Five different types of CNTs were used for this experiment: raw and
oxidized DWCNTs, raw and oxidized MWCNTs, and short length raw MWCNTs.
An agricultural sandy loam soil was contaminated using these five CNTs
at three concentrations (0.1, 10 and 100 mg/kg). Different morphological
and metabolism biomarkers were evaluated at the end of the five-week
exposure. Nutrient concentrations in the leaves and roots were analysed
by ICP-OES. Biomacromolecular changes in leaves were studied using
Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy by developing a chemometric
analysis. Candidate genes expression was analysed in the leaves using
qPCR.

<p style="text-align:justify">The results show that the different physico-chemical parameters of CNTs
significantly influence their impacts on canola plants. Only the DWCNTs
(smaller diameter) had impacts on canola. Functionalization also
influences the effects of CNTs. Raw DWCNTs inhibited several development
parameters of the canola, such as the germination rate, while oxidized
DWCNTs led to an enhanced development: increased height, foliar surface
or biomass. This was not related to nutrient concentrations or plant
water content. Additional data on biochemical and molecular response of
the plants to exposure will be presented.

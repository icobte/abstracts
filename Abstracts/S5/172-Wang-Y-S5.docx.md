<p style="text-align:justify">Members of the aquaporin (AQP) family have been suggested to transport
aluminum (Al) in plants; however, the Al form transported by AQPs and
the roles of AQPs in Al tolerance remain elusive. Here we report that
NIP1;2, a plasma membrane-localized member of the <i>Arabidopsis</i> nodulin
26-like intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily of the AQP family, facilitates
Al-malate transport from the root cell wall into the root symplasm, with
subsequent Al xylem loading and root-to shoot translocation, which are
critical steps in an internal Al tolerance mechanism in <i>Arabidopsis</i>.
We found that <i>NIP1;2</i> transcripts are expressed mainly in the root
tips, and that this expression is enhanced by Al but not by other metal
stresses. Mutations in <i>NIP1;2</i> lead to hyperaccumulation of toxic
Al<sup>3+</sup> in the root cell wall, inhibition of root-to-shoot Al
translocation, and a significant reduction in Al tolerance. NIP1;2
facilitates the transport of Al-malate, but not Al3+ ions, in both yeast
and Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that the formation of the Al-malate
complex in the root tip apoplast is a prerequisite for NIP1;2-mediated
Al removal from the root cell wall, and that this requires a functional
root malate exudation system mediated by the Al-activated malate
transporter, ALMT1. Taken together, these findings reveal a critical
linkage between the previously identified Al exclusion mechanism based
on root malate release and an internal Al tolerance mechanism identified
here through the coordinated function of NIP1;2 and ALMT1, which is
required for Al removal from the root cell wall, root-to-shoot Al
translocation, and overall Al tolerance in <i>Arabidopsis<i>.

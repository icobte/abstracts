<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Abstracts:</strong>Phytoremediation of lead (Pb) polluted soil by <i>Brassica
napus</i>has been evaluated as a promising strategy considering the higher
extraction efficiency and higher economical value. However, it urgently
demand to develop hyper-tolerant <i>B. napus</i>cultivars. In this study,
the variation of Pb tolerance was investigated among 472
worldwide-collected <i>B.napus</i>accessions, firstly. Results showed
revealed that the <i>B. napus</i>natural population exhibited a broad
variation of Pb tolerance, as the relative radicle length (RRL) were
range from 12.17 to 123.65. And then six Pb-tolerant genotypes were
selected for potential phytoremediation based on the criterion of RRL
&gt;85% in the population.

<p style="text-align:justify">In order to identify genetic factors of Pb tolerance in <i>B. napus</i>which
could be efficiently used in molecular breeding, the genome wide
association study (GWAS) were employed in present study. In these way,
nine candidate genes including <i>GSTUs</i>, <i>BCATs</i>, <i>UBP13</i>, <i>TBR</i>and
<i>HIPP01</i>, located in four QTLs were identified to be associated with Pb
tolerance. Furthermore, most of these genes were expressed significantly
higher in Pb-tolerant genotypes than in Pb-sensitive genotypes and it
were mostly induced by Pb stress in Pb-tolerant accessions. Theae nine
candidate genes which might contribute to Pb tolerance by regulating
glutathione metabolism, amino acid metabolism, ubiquitination, and cell
wall development were identified in <i>B. napus</i>.

<p style="text-align:justify">In conclusion, these findings of Pb-tolerant accessions and candidate
genes would provide valuable genetic resources for developing
hyper-tolerant <i>B. napus</i>cultivar and accelerate the progress of
remediating heavy metal polluted field.

<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic environmental contamination and the toxic effects it causes on
living organisms is a worldwide issue. Most Southeast Asian countries
are dependent on As-contaminated groundwater for drinking and irrigation
purposes, leading the latter to the contamination of agricultural soils
as well. Rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.), which is strongly susceptible to
accumulate As in its grains, is a staple food for more than half of the
world’s population, and many of the rice producing countries suffer from
As contamination in their groundwater or soil. Arsenic can be found in
both inorganic (arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V))) and organic
(methylated) forms in anaerobic and aerobic soil/water environments.
Arsenic uptake by plants is mainly as As(V), but, in flooded paddy soils
As(III), which is assumed to be more toxic than As(V), is normally the
predominant species. Therefore, the culture of rice under oxidizing
aerobic conditions has been recommended in fields suffering from As
contamination. Chemical analogy with phosphate and binding to thiol-rich
peptides, gives As(V) and As(III), respectively, its potential to be
toxic. Arsenate toxicity, as well as other heavy metals or environmental
stresses, has been proved to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS)
formation and lead to oxidative stress. But there is still not enough
information about the relationships between As accumulation and plant
oxidative stress. A hydroponics study was carried out to evaluate the
effects of increasing As concentrations on oxidative stress parameters
in rice plants grown in optimized hydroponic conditions. The aim was to
obtain prediction equations which may help to foresee rice behavior and
tolerance and phytotoxicity thresholds. A preliminary hydroponic
experiment was carried out in order to stablish the most favorable
conditions for plant growth, using a fixed arsenate dose (1 mg L<sup>-1</sup>)
and different pH and DOC concentrations were tested. Then, in the main
experiment, rice plants were exposed to increasing As doses (0-10 mg
L<sup>-1</sup>) at pH 6.0 and 100 mg L<sup>-1</sup> DOC. Rice plants were harvested after
21 days of treatment exposure. Trace element and nutrient concentrations
in the plants were determined (ICP-OES) after microwave assisted acid
digestion. Arsenic major species were analyzed using HPLC-AFS in PBS
sample extracts. Rice leaves were also assessed for oxidative stress
through lipid peroxidation (MDA) and protein oxidation (carbonyl
proteins) determinations. Plant yield (shoot and root length and dry
weights) decreased strongly with As concentrations above 2.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup>.
Arsenic concentrations increased with As dose in plant shoots and roots,
showing higher accumulation in the roots, except in the highest doses (5
and 10 mg L<sup>-1</sup>) where As concentrations in below and above parts were
similar. Moreover, As(V) accumulation was higher in the aerial parts and
As(III) in the roots. Lipid peroxidation (MDA concentration) increased
with As dose and appeared to be related to As(V) concentrations in the
roots. Carbonylated proteins increased also with As dose, but were
related to Cu and As(III) concentrations in the aerial part of the
plants. These results may help to establish As toxicity thresholds and
will be of interest for future studies regarding As accumulation and
oxidative stress/toxic effects in rice plants.

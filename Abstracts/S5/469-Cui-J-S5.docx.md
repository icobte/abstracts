<p style="text-align:justify">Although previous studies have indicated that Silicon nanoparticles
(SiNPs) can reduce Cd uptake into rice, little information is available
on the mechanism. Here, the hydroponically grown rice seedings exposed
to Cd treatment in the presence or absence of Si NPs were characterized.
The results showed that the presence of SiNPs alleviated Cd stress and
restrained the translocation of Cd from roots to shoots. The
morphological results showed that 
dramatic damage and severe structural changes in the root cells occurred
in the absence of SiNPs, whereas the presence of SiNPs remained nearly
intact cell structure of rice roots even in the presence of high
concentrations of Cd. The subcellular distribution results showed that
Cd content in cell wall of rice roots increased, and its concentration
in cell organelle and soluble fractions decreased at SiNPs treatments, indicating that Cd was blocked in the cell
wall by SiNPs. In addition, SiNPs alleviated
the oxidative damage to rice roots, decreased the expression of genes
involved in Cd uptake (<i>OsNramp1</i> and <i>OsNramp5</i>) and activated the
expression of genes involved in Cd transport into vacuoles (<i>OsHMA3</i>).
This study provided a molecular-scale insight into the understanding of
the SiNPs-reduced Cd uptake into rice.

<p style="text-align:justify">Gallium (Ga) and indium (In) are extensively used in the semiconductor
industry in current days, and are both emerging contamination elements
to our environment. Due to the limited information known about Ga and In
contaminants, previous research has evaluated their possible risk and
toxicity to rice seedlings. It was surprised to observe a differential
physiological response to Ga and In: the beneficial effect on the growth
of rice seedlings was found while applying low Ga concentrations (less
than 10 ppm); on the contrary, the In treated seedlings (higher than
0.08ppm) displayed growth inhibition, such as shorter root length. To
elucidate their difference on the regulatory mechanism, this study first
compared the gene expression between Ga- or In- treated plants using
whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing). Differential
expression was observed in the functional genes related to ion uptake,
reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and stress response. Their
changes at the molecular level was further correlated to physiological
parameters, e.g. the photosynthesis efficiency and the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>
distribution, and the ROS scavenging enzyme activity. Our finding
provides information on the differential molecular regulation and
distinguishing physiological response to Ga and In stress in rice
seedlings.

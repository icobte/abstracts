<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Sedum plumbizincicola</i> , a native Chinese cadmium (Cd) and zinc (Zn)
hyperaccumulator, is suitable for removing Cd and Zn from contaminated
acid soils. However, there is still little information on the influence
of excessive aluminium (Al) in acid soils on the metal phytoextraction
efficiency of hyperaccumulators. Here, we conducted hydroponics and
glasshouse pot experiments to investigate Al toxicity to <i>S.
plumbizincicola</i> at different Al levels. In hydroponics culture there
were six Al addition levels, namely 0 (CK), 50 (Al50), 100 (Al100), 200
(Al200) and 500 μmol L<sup>−1</sup> (Al500) and in the pot experiment there were
five levels (0, 50, 200, 500 and 1000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>). We used two soils, a
Hydragric Anthrosol from Guangdong province with a pH of 5.52 (GD) and a
Haplic Alisol from Guizhou province with pH of 4.86 (GZ). Hydroponics
results indicate that the shoot biomass of <i>S. plumbizincicola</i> 
decreased with increasing Al addition level but no significant
differences were observed in either shoot or root biomass among the
different Al treatments. Aluminium addition significantly decreased
plant root Cd and Zn uptake. Compared with the control, root Cd and Zn
uptake across the different Al treatments declined by 34-69 % and 31-55
%, respectively. However, Al addition did not decrease shoot Cd or Zn
uptake significantly. Further study shows that Al stress led to a
decline in root diameter, root volume and Cd and Zn adsorption on the
root surfaces. Aluminium toxicity symptoms were more apparent in the
glasshouse pot experiment as it involved a longer growing period. In
both soils, except for the 50 mg kg<sup>−1</sup> Al treatment which slightly
stimulated the biomass of <i>S. plumbizincicola</i> , Al addition
significantly inhibited plant biomass and the plants subjected to the
highest Al concentration (1000 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) died.

<p style="text-align:justify">Compared with the controls with no Al addition, 91 and 97 % declines in
shoot Cd uptake and 90 and 98 % declines in shoot Zn uptake in GD soil
and 80 and 84 % declines in shoot Cd uptake and 46 and 62 % declines in
shoot Zn uptake in GZ soil were found at 500 and 1000 mg Al kg<sup>−1</sup>.
Analysis of metal distribution and metal chemical forms in the plants
indicates that Al taken up was mainly sequestered in the roots and the
dominant fractions of Al transported to the shoots were the fraction
extracted by 0.6 M HCl and the residual fraction, which had low mobility
in the plants. Furthermore, Al addition significantly influenced the
chemical forms of Cd and Zn in the stems of <i>S. plumbizincicola</i> ,
reducing the mobility of Cd and Zn the stems and thus restraining Cd/Zn
transfer to the leaves. Significant decreases in pH were observed in the
soils after repeated phytoextraction by <i>S. plumbizincicola</i> , therefore
Al toxicity may be an important limiting factor in the decontamination
of acid soils using <i>S. plumbizincicola<i>.

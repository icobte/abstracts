<p style="text-align:justify">Environmental, biological and ecosystem-specific properties may
influence the transfer of chemical elements (CEs) from soils to plants,
including the variation in the chemical elements’ concentration, their
types and physiological parameters, such as biotransformation ability in
the plants.

<p style="text-align:justify">The interface between the soil and a plant, or, the concentration of a
particular chemical element in a plant with respect to its concentration
in the soil, is the basis for a widely used Biological Absorption
Coefficient, also known as the Transfer Factor, Bioaccumulation Factor,
Mobility Ratio, or Plant–Soil Coefficient, which are expressed in terms
of the chemical element’s concentration in the plant and soil. However,
from the biogeochemical perspective, these coefficients/factors can
provide a comparison of the chemical element (CE) concentration in
different media (plants and soil), but only in a particular place (under
typical environmental conditions) and at a particular time. Therefore, a
quantitative method, using the <i>dynamic factors of bioaccumulation,
biophilicity, translocation, bioavailability</i> and <i>phytoremediation</i> , is
offered to assess the variation in the process of the uptake of chemical
elements by different plants, to evaluate the influence of soil
modification on their participation in the plants’ metabolism and to
perform quantitative evaluation of phytoremediation efficiency over a
particular period of time.

<p style="text-align:justify">Dynamic factors help to identify and demonstrate more than only the
primary causes (e.g. the total CEs concentration in the substrate) for
intensive CEs transfer to a plant. For this purpose, the relationship
between the CE concentrations in the morphological part of a plant and
CE concentration in the substrate is used. It allows the available
biogeochemical data on biophilic CEs and the barrier and non-barrier
plants to be used in the evaluation. The dynamic bioavailability,
bioaccumulation and translocation factors also show that physical and
chemical changes in soil can cause physiological variation in
biogeochemical migration of substances in a plant. Determining the
transfer intensity based on using the dynamic factors of bioaccumulation
and biophilicity, it has been found that the biotic and abiotic factors,
influence plants and can be characterized by a similar bioaccumulation
level of CEs. This helps to evaluate the scope of activity and
importance of these factors.

<p style="text-align:justify">The calculation of the bioaccumulation factors in the process of
evaluating the extent of contamination and the effect of CEs helps to
more accurately define the affected zone of an ecosystem and to
determine the role of plants as the primary geochemical (biogeochemical)
barriers to aerogenic CE transfer. Thus, the use of the dynamic factor
method for assessing the quality of the environment is effective in
evaluating environmental risks, biogeochemical CE migration, the
environmental effect of CEs migration and the efficiency of
phytotechnologies.

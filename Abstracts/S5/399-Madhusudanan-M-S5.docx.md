<p style="text-align:justify">Nano materials can be used in producing more soluble and diffusible
sources of Zn fertilizers. Higher specific surface area and reactivity
of ZnO-NPs compared to bulky ZnO may improve Zn solubility, diffusion in
soil and hence better Zn availability to plants. Nano-fertilizers can
supply essential nutrients for plant growth, have higher use efficiency
and can be delivered in a timely manner to a rhizospheric target or by
foliar spray.

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Objective:</strong> To evaluate the effectiveness of different concentrations of
ZnO-NPs on plant growth attributes, grain yield and final Zn levels in
rice crop compared with conventional delivery of Zn.

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Methods:</strong> Solution culture and greenhouse experiments were carried out to
study the impact of ZnO-NPs with a mean particle size of 30 nm on rice
plant growth traits, Zn concentration and yield. For comparative study,
different concentrations of ZnO-NPs were used as compared to
conventional ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. 7H<sub>2</sub>O (10 mg/kg) fertilizer and control (no Zn).

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Results and Discussion:</strong> The highest root and shoot length, dry weight
and grain yield was recorded with the application of nanoscale ZnO at 10
mg/kg which shows higher growth and yield differed from that of ZnSO<sub>4</sub>
and control thus confirming better interaction between nanoparticles and
rhizosphere. The highest germination percentage of 91.7 was observed
when the rice seeds were treated with the nanoscale ZnO at 100 mg/kg;
and it was significantly more than that of control and ZnSO<sub>4</sub>. Higher
doses of ZnO nanoparticle had negatively influenced the plant growth and
yield parameters. The delivery of Zn through ZnO-NPs resulted in
positive effect on seed germination, root and shoot growth, seedling
vigour index, number of tillers, had higher chlorophyll content, Zn
concentration and grain yield. Application of ZnO-NPs supplied Zn, had
higher use efficiency, better plant growth and significantly improved
the yield.

<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Delivery of Zn nutrient through ZnO nanoparticles in right
dose, right time and of the right size could be effective and beneficial
in enhancing the growth and yield attributes of rice crop. There is a
possibility of reducing dose of Zn using nanostructured fertilizer like
ZnO- NPs.

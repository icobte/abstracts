<p style="text-align:justify">Long term mining activities can cause significant metal pollution in the
environment, thereby showing potential risk to the nearby soil and
plants. Elucidating the interfacial processes of trace metals from real
contaminated soil to plants including wild plants and rice within the
rhizosphere can provide important information on metal biogeochemistry
and food safety. The current study aims to explore the spatial
distribution and molecular speciation of Cu from soil rhizosphere to
plants including indigenous plant species and rice collected from
mining-impacted field sites, and reveal the possible uptake mechanisms.
X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis indicated that Cu
was primarily associated with iron oxide and sulfide in soil with a
minor proportion of organic complexed species. With plant growth, the
Cu-oxalate like organic species in rhizosphere soil significantly
increased, with a corresponding decrease in Cu-goethite.
Synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (Î¼-XRF) microscopy and X-ray
absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis indicated that most Cu
was sequestered around the root surface/epidermis, primarily forming Cu
alginate-like species as a Cu-tolerance mechanism for both indigenous
plant <i>M. floridulus</i> and rice root. From the root epidermis to the
cortex and vascular bundle, more thiol-S bound Cu(I) complex was
observed, representing the reduced product of Cu(II) by thiol-S ligand
in the root. The absorbed Cu was probably transported from the root to
the aerial part as Cu-histidine complex, which was observed in the root
xylem. In conclusion, the large retention capacity and reduction of
Cu(II) in plant roots alleviated Cu toxicity to plants, which was
beneficial for phytostabilizing Cu underground and lowering Cu
accumulation in rice grains. These findings showed detailed Cu uptake
mechanisms in plants from field contaminated sites, which shed lights on
the Cu detoxification process and potential remediation strategies.

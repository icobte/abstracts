<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium is a nonessential heavy metal pollutant in the environment and
agricultural products. Cadmium pollution poses a serious problem to
China, meanwhile, due to the huge pressure of food demand, the
moderately polluted land covering a large area must continue to be
engaged in high-intensity agricultural production, which is difficult to
be used for remediation alone. Therefore, environmental remediation not
only has a long way to go, but also relies on novel strategies that are
totally different from those taken in developed countries. Chinese
scientists previously proposed a strategy to combine low-accumulation
crop germplasm resources with heavy metal hyperaccumulator plants.
However, this strategy passively relying on natural plants and the
environment faces the following bottlenecks: 1) Low-accumulation traits
of heavy metals in existing crop germplasm resources are significantly
affected by the environment, and the effect is difficult to control. 2)
natural heavy metal low-accumulation crops are often accompanied by the
low accumulation of essential nutrients, which have certain negative
impacts on the nutritional quality and yield of crops; 3) natural
hyperaccumulators grow slowly, have small biomass, and compete for the
effective cultivation area. Due to those considerations, we propose the
concept of “remediation-rice”, which specifically blocks the migration
of heavy metal to edible parts to meet the food safety requirements, and
promotes heavy metal accumulation in rice straws, allowing
phytoremediation of heavy metals meanwhile producing safe grains in
polluted paddy fields. The recent progress of our research team has
conceptually verified the feasibility of “remediation-rice”, and the
most recent progress will also be reported.

<p style="text-align:justify">Lead (Pb) is a non-essential, highly toxic element. As it forms stable
complexes with organic matter and adsorbs to Al-, Fe- and Mn-oxides it
is highly persistent in soil, accumulating in the environment and posing
a threat to human health. To prevent the potentially harmful effects of
a long-term human Pb exposition by food consumption and to take measures
for the elimination of Pb in the environment profound knowledge of the
processes underlying Pb uptake, translocation and accumulation in plants
is of great importance. At present our knowledge regarding these
mechanisms lags far behind arsenic and cadmium. This can be mainly
attributed to Pb having a low solubility at a pH greater than 5, as well
as the formation of Pb-phosphate precipitates, making it challenging to
analyze plant-Pb interactions in commonly used experimental settings. We
have therefore developed a novel low-phosphate, low-pH assay system,
enabling the analysis of plant Pb toxicity and tolerance under realistic
Pb concentrations.

<p style="text-align:justify">This is being used for two different approaches: (i) the search for
relevant genes and proteins by studying induced or natural genetic
variation; (ii) the physiological analysis of Pb uptake and accumulation
in the model cereal barley.

<p style="text-align:justify">Evidence is available for Pb uptake via hitch-hiking of transporters for
essential elements, e.g. Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and Pb detoxification by the
phytochelatin pathway. To find additional factors involved in Pb
toxicity and tolerance we tested metal hypersensitive EMS mutants
isolated in our lab for Pb hypersensitivity and identified one mutant.
We will report the identification and functional characterization of the
causal gene responsible for the phenotype.

<p style="text-align:justify">Furthermore, we could detect pronounced natural variation in <i>A.
thaliana</i> Pb tolerance. This enabled the identification of quantitative
trait loci involved in Pb toxicity effects through a genome wide
association study. For this over 300 ecotypes were screened regarding
their Pb phenotype and the correlation between respective phenotype and
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was determined. Additionally, we
characterized a Pb hypersensitive ecotype, which we discovered and
collected ourselves. The SNPs we found converged into the same metabolic
pathway that is affected by Pb stress and possibly involved in
tolerance.

<p style="text-align:justify">Considering the mobility and accumulation of Pb in crops in our second
approach we use <i>Hordeum vulgare</i> as a model crop plant. We have
analyzed three different ecotypes of <i>H. vulgare</i>, which display
contrasting profiles of grain micronutrient accumulation. For the first
time we could detect Pb in the grain of barley both after hydroponic and
contaminated soil cultivation. The screening for ecotypes which
accumulate an enhanced amount of essential elements combined with a
decreased accumulation of toxic elements is an important tool towards
diminishing the entry of pollutants into the food web.

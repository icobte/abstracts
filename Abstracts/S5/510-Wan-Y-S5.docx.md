<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium (Cd) is absorbed readily by rice plants, and is transferred to
humans when contaminated rice is consumed. The addition of selenium (Se)
to the nutrient solutions has been shown to reduce the accumulation of
Cd in rice seedlings. However, as the relevant underlying mechanism
remains unclear. Hydroponic experiments were performed in this study to
investigate the effects of selenite or selenate on the Cd subcellular
distribution and xylem transport in rice seedlings (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.)
under Cd stress. The antioxidative defense responses in rice plants were
also assayed. Results showed that the supplementation of both Se forms
decreased the Cd accumulations in rice roots and shoots. Selenite
addition significantly decreased the Cd contents in different
subcellular fractions of rice roots, while increased the proportion of
Cd distributed to soluble
cytosol by 23.41%, and decreased the Cd distribution in organelle by
28.74% by contrast to the Cd-alone treatment. As for selenate addition,
only the Cd distribution ratio of cytosol was increased by 13.07%.
Furthermore, 55.86% decrease of Cd concentration in xylem sap was
displayed when adding selenite, while little change was found in rice
plants exposed to the
treatment co-applied with selenate. Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and
malondialdehyde(MDA) contents in rice roots were elevated under Cd
stress, and the addition of selenite and selenate decreased H2O2 levels
by 77.78% and 59.26%, respectively. Cd and Se co-exposure elevated the
glutathion (GSH) accumulations in rice shoot and roots, and the degree
of the increase was: co-applied with selenite &gt; co-applied with
selenate &gt; Cd alone treatment. The exposure of Cd significantly
increased the catalase (CAT) activity in roots, while decreased that in
shoot. Upon selenite or selenate supplementation, CAT activity in rice root was increased
compared to that when Cd was applied alone. Cadmium or Se addition did
not considerably change the activities of peroxidase (POD) or ascorbate
peroxidase (APX) compared to the control.

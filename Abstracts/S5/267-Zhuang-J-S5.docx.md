<p style="text-align:justify">Soil environmental quality standard (GB 15618-2018) in China has made
restrictions on heavy metal contents for agricultural land. The risk
screening values and intervention values are divided into four segments
according to soil pH. However it is still unreasonable to evaluate the
safety of agricultural production under some cases relying on the
standards, due to the complexity of soil properties and the differences
of the absorption of heavy metals by vegetables. This study chose
nationwide vegetables and corresponding cultivated soils as research
objects to explore the difference of absorption and enrichment
characteristics of heavy metals in different vegetables. It integrated
977 sample groups in all through literature search and sample
collection. Also the cadmium (Cd) soil-plant transport model was
established to the safe production threshold for vegetables in the soil.
The results showed that the contents of eight heavy metals in vegetables
conformed to positive skewed distribution. The median values of Cadmium
(Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu),
zinc (Zn) and nickel (Ni) content were 0.62 mg/kg, 2.29 mg/kg, 0.66
mg/kg, 1.05 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 6.17 mg/kg, 25.35 mg/kg, and 0.11 mg/kg,
respectively. The Pb, Cd, Hg, As and Cr content in edible parts of
vegetables had exceeded the standards to varying degrees, according to
the limits made in food contaminant standard (GB 2762-2017). Lead had
the highest exceeding rate. The bioconcentration factors (BCF) of heavy
metals in different kinds of vegetables distributed in log normal
mostly. Among the five toxic elements, vegetables showed the highest
enrichment level of Cd and BCF of Cd ranged from 0.001 to 25. The Cd BCF
geometric mean of leafy, root, fruit and leguminous vegetables was about
9-68, 4-25, 3-37, 4-28 times respectively compared to other elements.
Therefor the enrichment ability of vegetables to elements could be quite
different. Among different kinds of vegetables, leafy and root
vegetables had stronger enrichment ability. Leafy vegetables were more
likely to absorb Cd and Ni while root vegetables enriched Pb, Zn, Cu and
Cr more easily. This study established the prediction equations for Cd
transfer of leafy and fruit vegetables in the soil-plant system. It
concluded that Cd content in edible parts was positively correlated with
Cd content in soil. The soil total Cd explained 55%、76.86%、16.87% and
51.8% of Cd content variance in leafy, root, fruit and leguminous
vegetables, respectively. However the relationship between Cd content in
vegetable, soil Cd content and pH could not be well fitted (r<sup>2</sup>&lt;0.1,
<i>p</i>&lt;0.001) by a linear regression model. Although the extended
Freundlich-type function improved the correlation performance of Cd
transfer equations. These results indicated that the data of a wider
range of paired samples or more detailed restrictions on the types of
vegetables were required, in the further study of prediction the Cd
transfer between soil-plant system. The conclusion of this study
provides theoretical basis for the farmland soil management and
relatively rational cultivation choose of vegetables for clean
argricultural production and food safety ensurance.

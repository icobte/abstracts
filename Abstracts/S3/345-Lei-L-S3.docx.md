<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is a toxic element for both human and plants, but the
toxic responses of plants to different forms of antimony and its
associated mechanisms are unknown. This study was carried out to
investigate the effects of different forms of Sb [Sb(III) and Sb(V)]
on the root exudates, root endogenous hormones, root cell wall
components and antioxidant systems in rice plant via three hydroponic
experiments. The results showed that Sb(III) displayed a higher toxicity
than Sb(V) to the plant which accumulated much more Sb in its tissues
under Sb(III) exposure than that under Sb(V) exposure. Under Sb(III)
exposure, most of absorbed Sb was found to be Sb(III) in the shoots and
roots; however when plants were exposed to Sb(V), most of absorbed Sb in
this rice plant was Sb(V). Only two kinds of endogenous hormones were
detected as abscisic acid (ABA) and salicylic acid (SA). The addition of
Sb(III) significantly increased the content of ABA but Sb(V) did not,
probably suggesting the higher toxicity of Sb(III) than Sb(V) might be
due to the stimulation of ABA content. The addition of Sb(III)
significantly increased the concentration of oxalic acid but decreased
the concentrations of formic, acetic and maleic acids. Sb(V) also
enhanced the oxalic acid concentration at 20 mg L<sup>-1</sup> Sb(V) treatment
level but reduced the concentrations of formic and acetic acids.
Different forms of Sb dose-dependently increased the content of pectin,
but significantly enhanced the content of lignin in cell wall. Different
forms of Sb induced oxidative stress, but rice plant triggered the
activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX)
to counteract the oxidative stress.

<p style=text-align:justify>The environmental distribution and anthropogenic dispersion of both
antimony (Sb) and arsenic (As) have received considerable attention over
recent years, although the ecological risk posed is still little
understood in many ecosystems. The aim of this study was to examine and
compare spatial and temporal uptake and biotransfer of the metalloids in
foodwebs of the Bakers Creek - Macleay River catchment of northern NSW,
which has been strongly affected by Sb and As contamination with over a
century of gold (Au)-Sb mining and processing. Metalloid concentrations
were measured in the water, sediment, and biota representing various
trophic levels and diverse species assemblages (biofilms, algae,
detritus, aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates, tadpoles, and fish) at
fifteen morphologically and hydrologically different sites over four
occasions in 2015. Data indicated that all stream components examined
were variably enriched with both metalloids (e.g. 3.64 – 1187.82 µg
L<sup>-1</sup> Sb and 0.10 – 64.79 µg L<sup>-1</sup> As in water; 58.69 -554.82 µg g<sup>-1</sup>
Sb and 4.85 – 30.16 µg g<sup>-1</sup> As in detritus; 83.15 – 855.93 µg g<sup>-1</sup> Sb
and 70.08 – 222.27 µg g<sup>-1</sup> As in sediment; 8.03 – 1203.35 µg g<sup>-1</sup> Sb
and 13.38 – 255.36 µg g<sup>-1</sup> As in stream autotrophs; and 1.04 – 140.10
µg g<sup>-1</sup> Sb and 0.56 – 404.92 µg g<sup>-1</sup> As in heterotrophs) close to the
source Bakers Creek (BC) site at all sampling occasions but this
enrichment decreased substantially downstream from that site. The
spatial distribution of Sb in water and sediment was strongly associated
with distance from the mine, dissimilar to As, which was independent of
distance. While bioaccumulation in the food webs existed and some of the
greatest concentrations of Sb reported in biota were recorded, As showed
greater uptake efficiency in foodweb biota. Temporal changes in
metalloid sources (water, detritus, and sediment) to biota had little or
no effect on Sb and As bioaccumulation in trophic groups, other than Sb
in autotrophs collected from one site. Bioaccumulation of As in tissues
    of freshwater mussels, <i>Corbicula sp.</i>, was greatest in body tissue, and
As uptake was greater than Sb in all tissues. In contrast, the greatest
Sb concentration in the mussels was found in the muscular foot tissue.
Concentrations of Sb and As were elevated in plants, but sediment/soil
to plant transfer was small, even though rhizosphere sediment/soil was
elevated for both metalloids. Comparisons and mapping of metalloid
transfer across feeding groups showed that neither trophic transference
nor biomagnification of Sb or As through the food webs of the different
sites occurred. Rather, there was a biodiminution of both metalloids
with increasing trophic level. This is the first study with such a wide
scope of sampling biota for both Sb and As and provides insight into
metalloid ecosystem distribution and food web transfer. Ecotoxicological
profiling of the measured concentrations on a range of aquatic organisms
is the next practical step to better assess the risk associated with Sb
and As co-occurence in aquatic environments.

<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is an element of growing interest. Its toxicity and
mobility are strongly influenced by redox processes. Pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) is
the most abundant natural sulfur mineral in the earth’s crust. Pyrite is
also associated with stibnite. Simultaneously, Some studies have
reported that Sb(III) can be oxidized to Sb(V) both in solution and on
pyrite surfaces in oxic condition. The pyrite-induced hydroxyl radical
(·OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) are the main oxidants for Sb(III)
oxidation. However, pyrite is thermodynamically unstable and can be
oxidized in aerobic environments. It has been proposed that pyrite
oxidation results in the formation of an oxidation layer on its surface.
The nature of the oxidation layer on pyrite will determine the
reactivity of weathered pyrite in aqueous solutions. Our interest here
is the surface phase will determine how weathered pyrite might oxidize
Sb(III). In this research, pyrite was exposed to air at room temperature
for 1 week and the product was named SOP(O<sub>2</sub>). Aqueous pyrite oxidation
experiments were also performed. In this step, pyrite samples were
immersed in air-saturated water (pH=3, 5 and 7) for 1 week and
SOP(H<sub>2</sub>0) were obtained. Sb(III) oxidation in pyrite suspension was
investigated at pH =3, 5 and 7 under oxic condition with 2μmol/L Sb(III)
and 0.5 g/L pyrite. Our study showed that the oxidation efficiencies of
Sb(III) by SOP(O<sub>2</sub>) were enhanced compared with
by pyrite in all conditions. But the efficiencies of Sb(III) oxidation
by SOP(H<sub>2</sub>0) were greatly restrained at pH=3,5 and 7. We found that the
ferric and ferrous (hydr)oxides were formed on the surface of SOP(O<sub>2</sub>).
Besides, pyrite oxidation in water phase results in the formation of an
Fe-hydroxide or Fe-oxyhydroxide layer on the surface. Thus oxidation
layer on pyrite has great influence on the efficiency of Sb(III)
oxidation.

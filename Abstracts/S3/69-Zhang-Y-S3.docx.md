<p style=text-align:justify>The remediation of soil contaminated with organic compounds and heavy
metals, alone or as a mixture, has becoming an environmental issue of
worldwide concern. In the current study, four soils with variable TOC
contents were sampled from two industrial sites, representing the high
dose perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and heavy metals (antimony, Sb and
lead, Pb) contaminated soils. Two Fe rich waste materials (slag and Fe
charcoal) produced during the melting process of iron and titanium ore were tested as remediation
agents, with the target of immobilizing pollutants in the soil systems,
preventing them from contaminating the environment.

<p style=text-align:justify>Both materials were tested for their remediation efficacy of heavy
metals (Pb and Sb) and PFCs contaminated soils. The slag and Fe-charcoal
are rich in Fe and calcium (Ca), the abundant Fe oxyhydroxides endows
both sorbents high affinity for metals. Together with the formation of
Ca‒Pb/Sb‒Fe precipitates, Sb adsorption to slag and Fe-charcoal ranged
from 8.2 ‒ 30.7 μg g<sup>-1</sup> and 4.7 ‒ 26.3 μg g<sup>-1</sup> respectively. For Pb,
slag showed an adsorption of 3.0 ‒8.2 μg g<sup>-1</sup>, and this value of
Fe-charcoal was 8.8 ‒ 13.7 μg g<sup>-1</sup>. Generally, organic matter in the
soil system hindered the adsorption of both Sb and Pb by slag, most
likely due to competition for the active sites on the sorbent. However,
Fe-charcoal showed better performance with high TOC soils, which can be
attributed to the formation of organo-metal complexes that helped the
sequestration of Sb and Pb. Fe-charcoal showed promising performances in
the immobilization of PFCs in mineral soil with low TOC content, the
Freundlich constant (<i>K<sub>F</sub></i>) ranged between 5.1 ‒6.5 (μg kg<sup>-1</sup>) (μg
L<sup>-1</sup>)<sup>-n</sup>, with the <i>n<sub>F</sub></i> values of 0.33 ‒ 0.44. However, the high
organic content of the high TOC-soils drastically hindered the
adsorption of PFCs by Fe-charcoal.

<p style=text-align:justify>In general, both slag and Fe-charcoal can be used as reliable
remediation agents for Pb and Sb contaminated soils, while the
utilization of Fe-charcoal requires moderate to low content of organic
carbon in the bulk soil for PFCs immobilization. The result of this
study gives the option of reusing these Fe rich wasted materials as
promising sorbents for both heavy metals and organic pollutants.
Possible uses of these sorbents can be as soil amendments related to the
heavily polluted industrial sites remediation or used as barriers in
landfills for sorption of leachate contaminants.

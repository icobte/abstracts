<p style=text-align:justify>Transformation and transport of Sb are significantly influenced by
oxidation in natural environment, therefore, as an effective oxidant for
Sb(III), MnO<sub>2</sub> may have essential impacts on the ecological effects of
Sb in waters contaminated by acidic mine drainage or wastewater
containing high concentrated Sb. The present research investigated the
effects of coexisted Fe(II) on oxidation and adsorption of Sb(III) by
MnO<sub>2</sub> under acidic conditions. Results of kinetic experiments showed
that oxidation and adsorption of Sb(III) by MnO<sub>2</sub> were both influenced
by Fe(II) in Sb(III)-Fe(II) simultaneous oxidation system and Fe(II)
pretreated system. Oxidation was inhibited yet adsorption was promoted
in the presence of soluble Fe(II), and both effects were enhanced with
increasing ratio of Fe(II): Sb(III). Through scanning electron
microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer, X-ray diffraction and X-ray
photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, it was confirmed that Fe(III)
compounds were formed around MnO<sub>2</sub> particles, and they were the reason
that caused inhibition of Sb(III) oxidation. However, two different
Fe(III) compounds were formed around MnO<sub>2</sub> particles when Fe(II)
intervened experiment systems in different ways. In simultaneous
oxidation system, poorly crystallized or amorphous Fe-Sb precipitates
(probably FeSbO<sub>4</sub>) were formed around MnO<sub>2</sub> particles after
competitive oxidation of Sb(III) and Fe(II), while in Fe(II) pretreated
oxidation system, Fe(II) pretreatment caused formation of schwertmannite
around MnO<sub>2</sub> particles. Both Fe(III) compounds prevented the direct
contact of Sb(III) with MnO<sub>2</sub> surface, but most Sb(III) could still
diffuse through both Fe(III) compounds and be oxidized by MnO<sub>2</sub>, while
part of the Sb(III) was adsorbed by Fe(III) compounds. The newly formed
Sb(V) was firstly adsorbed by Fe(III) compounds, and then released into
solution after reaching adsorption saturation. The present study
revealed that Fe(II) was critical to Sb(III) oxidation and adsorption by
MnO<sub>2</sub>, and the influence mechanisms were different when Fe(II)
intervened the reaction systems through different ways.

<p style=text-align:justify>Adsorption onto mineral and organic surfaces can profoundly affect the
mobility and fate of dissolved ions in natural environments, however
currently there is a poor understanding of antimony (Sb) adsorption onto
mixture of these two sorbents. Manganese oxides in soils, sediments and
water systems can bind strongly with bacterial biomass through
physical-chemical processes to form bacteria-mineral composites, which
may play a significant role in determining the sequestration of antimony
at solid interfaces. In the study, we synthesis mineral-bacteria
composite using birnessite and Sb-tolerant <i>Bacillus cereus</i> that
isolated from Sb-contaminated soils in Lengshuijiang City, China; we
investigate the binding of Sb(V) on cell-birnessite composite using
batch adsorption coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
From the Scanning electron microscope, we can see that the flaky
birnessite is tightly bound to the surfaces of bacterial cells.
Adsorption of Sb(V) conforms to the Langmuir isotherm model, wih maximum
adsorption of Sb(V) of ~59.2 mg g<sup>–1</sup> on birnessite, compared to that
of 14.3 mg g<sup>–1</sup> on isolated bacteria. The adsorption of Sb(V) decreases
with pH increasing from 3 to 10. The adsorption of Sb(V) on the <i>B.
cereus</i>-birnessite composite is intermediate between those on the
end-members. Morevoer, Sb(V) adsorption conforms to a non-additive rule,
i.e., Sb removal by cell-birnessite composites is ~16-50% larger than
that predicted based on the end-member adsorptivities. XPS results
confirm that Sb binds to the MnOH groups of birnessite, and the carboxyl
and amino groups of bacteria in the cell-birnessite composite. In these
cases, our results indicate that it wil be important to consider the
fate and mobility of antimony with respect to manganese oxides-organo
composites, in addition to pure mineral phases. Future work should focus
on the changes of environmental factors such as under anaerobic
condition or in the presence of trivalent antimony.

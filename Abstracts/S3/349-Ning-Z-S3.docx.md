<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony and its compounds have been emerging global contaminants due to
their toxicity, transportation and wild use. The mining industry is one
of the most important sources of Sb, which could cause increasingly
accumulation of that Sb and other toxic metals in supergene environment,
such as soil and water. In the past 20 years, numerous studies focused
on the environmental geochemistry of Sb and its environmental risk, but
researches on the transportation and accumulation of Sb between
sediments and aquatic plants are still rare. Interestingly, we have
found that <i>Typha latifolia</i> Linn. can survive in a wetland seriously
contaminated by discharges from a tailing pond of a large Sb smelting
factory, southwest China. However, there is little information on why
<i>Typha latifolia</i> Linn. can live in such wicked environment with high Sb
concentrations, and whether it can uptake Sb or not. In order to
investigate the distribution of Sb and As in the wetland, and ascertain
the tolerance and/or accumulation of Sb by <i>Typha latifolia</i> Linn.,
eighteen sediments (including nine surface and nine rhizosphere
sediments) and nine <i>Typha latifolia</i> Linn. samples were collected, and
the concentrations of Sb and As in all samples were analysed by ICPMS.
The results showed that the concentrations of Sb and As in sediments
were 743.7 ± 327.0 mg/kg and 24.4 ± 11.6 mg/kg, respectively, suggesting
that the sediments in the wetland were seriously polluted by wastewater
discharged from the tailing pond of the large Sb smelting factory.
Compared to surface sediments (669.6 ± 228.8mg/kg Sb and 21.3 ± 4.70
mg/kg As), the rhizosphere sediments were much more enriched in Sb
(817.9 ± 403.1mg/kg) and As (27.5 ± 15.6 mg/kg ), which may infer that
the root exudates of <i>Typha latifolia</i> Linn. could be helpful for
bounding Sb and As around its rhizosphere. <i>Typha latifolia</i> Linn. can
uptake large amounts of Sb and As, although our previous research had
documented that the bioavailabilities of Sb and As in tailings were
quite low. Specially, Sb concentration was up to 300.0 mg/kg, suggesting
that <i>Typha latifolia</i> Linn. has the characteristics of tolerating and
accumulating high Sb concentration. In all, this study had confirmed
that the wastewater from the Sb tailing pond had polluted the adjacent
aquatic environment, and <i>Typha latifolia</i> Linn. is a Sb-tolerant and
Sb-accumulate specie, which has great potential for bioremediation of Sb
polluted aquatic environment in future.

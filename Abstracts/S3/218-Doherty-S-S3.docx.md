<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) derived from historic mining waste from the Hillgrove
gold/Sb mine has dispersed over 300km through the Macleay River
Catchment of south-east Australia. Stibnite and Sb-rich ore form the
bulk of the dispersed material, with minor arsenopyrite. The resulting
co-contamination of the Macleay River has been well-characterised, but
the processes underlying the sequestration of As and Sb in the catchment
are unknown. This study aimed to characterise metalloid mobilisation and
sequestration processes whilst also identifying diferences in the
geochemisty of the two elements in this system. Sediments were collected
from 13 sites spanning the length of the waste dispersal pathway in the
river system. Sediment elemental content was determined with aqua regia
digestion and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry
(ICP-OES). Elemental composition of individual grains from high
concentration sites was undertaken using electron microprobe. Extracts
targeting the water soluble (H<sub>2</sub>O), easily exchangeable (0.5M
NaHCO<sub>3</sub>), and amorphous-associated (0.5M acid ammonium oxalate)
metalloid content of sediments were analysed using ICP-mass spectrometry
and atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS). Iron (Fe) was significantly
positively correlated with total As and Sb in the lower Macleay River,
while in the more heavily contaminated upper reaches only As was
correlated with Fe. Electron microprobe analysis of highly contaminated
sediments identified grains of high purity Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>. Arsenic was
identified at concentrations up to 2.5 % of total grain weight, but only
in association with Fe oxide grains. The three-step extraction showed
that a similar proportion of total Sb (59 – 88 %) and As (59 – 82 %)
remained in the residual fraction of the upper catchment sediment,
whilst in the sediments of the lower river residual As (51 – 71 %) was
significantly greater than Sb (27 – 53 %). Antimony in sediment was more
water soluble than As throughout the catchment (0.6 – 2.2 % total Sb
compared with 0.4 – 1.4 % of total As), but 0.5M NaHCO<sub>3</sub> extractable As
was greater than Sb (by 1.9 – 5.3 times). Metalloid association with
amorphous phases was significant and positively correlated with distance
from the upper catchment source, being up to 29 – 49 % of total As and
22 – 64 % of Sb in lower catchment sediments. Antimony associated with
amorphous phases was significantly lower at two sites often subject to
anoxic conditions (22 – 28 % of total Sb) compared with nearby aerated
sediments (47 – 63 %). This variability was not observed for As. The
results suggest that As has been more completely dissolved from its
mineral sources than Sb, and been significantly incorporated into Fe
hydroxyoxides throughout the dispersal pathway. In contrast Sb remains
in high purity forms in the upper Macleay River, and becomes
increasingly associated with amorphous phases in the lower reaches. The
sediment associations of Sb were more variable than those of As when
comparing sites with different redox conditions. This study provides
critical insights into metalloid sequestration processes under a range
of environmental conditions which is vital to fully quantify the risks
posed by As and Sb in contaminated river catchments.

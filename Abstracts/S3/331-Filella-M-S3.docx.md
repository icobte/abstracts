<p style=text-align:justify>After 20 years of active work, research on the environmental chemistry
and fate of antimony has reached a mature state but many fundamental
questions remain unanswered. Progress can be made by efficiently
constructing knowledge from the flood of data being continuously
produced rather than focusing only in producing new results. Two
approaches are discussed:

<p style=text-align:justify>1) A BUKI (Building Up Knowledge Initiative) dealing with the
environmental chemistry of antimony. A BUKI is a collaborative approach
based on the combination of a web-based platform and the elaboration of
systematic reviews. More at: <a href="http://www.unige.ch/antimony/buki/">http://www.unige.ch/antimony/buki/.

<p style=text-align:justify>2) The construction and update of a thermodynamically-consistent
equilibrium constant database for antimony by following the JESS
approach. More at: <a href="http://jess.murdoch.edu.au/jess\_home.htm">http://jess.murdoch.edu.au/jess\_home.htm.

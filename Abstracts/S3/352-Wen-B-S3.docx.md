<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is a metalloid element with potential toxicity and
carcinogenicity, and is a global environmental contaminant that is
ubiquitously present in the environment as a result of natural processes
and human activities. Mine exploitation is an important source of Sb
contamination, and very high levels of contamination have been detected
around mine sites. Antimony mobilization is closely linked to redox
state and adsorption and desorption in nature. Molybdenum (Mo) and Mo
isotope can be informative of the redox conditions, moreover, Mo isotope
fractionation is mainly controlled by the adsorption and desorption onto
Fe/Mn-(hydr)oxides. The Mo isotope compositions were analyzed to
elucidate the Sb mobilization in high Sb groundwater from the world’s
largest antimony mine, Xikuangshan (XKS) Sb mine.

<p style=text-align:justify>The Mo isotope values (δ<sup>98</sup>Mo) in groundwater at XKS Sb mine range from
+1.57‰ to +2.49‰ (average of +1.96‰), which are relatively heavier that
those reported in fresh waters. The relationships between δ <sup>98</sup>Mo
values and Fe, Mn and Mo concentrations suggest that compared with Mn,
Fe-(hydr)oxides may have a more significant effect on Mo isotope. The
increased δ<sup>98</sup>Mo values with an decrease in Mo concentrations might
result from the adsorption of Mo from Fe/Mn-(hydr)oxides, and also might
be a consequence of the faster rate of adsorption of Mo from groundwater
than the rate of desorption of Mo from Fe/Mn-(hydr)oxides. Importantly,
the relationships between δ<sup>98</sup>Mo values and Sb and As concentrations
further demonstrate that adsorption and desorption of Fe/Mn-(hydr)oxides
are an important factor for affecting the Sb mobilization in
groundwater, more specially, a competitive adsorption with As may occur.

<p style=text-align:justify>This study is the first to examine the Mo isotope compositions in high
Sb groundwater mine, and the results show that the Mo isotope would be
an important tool in demonstrating the migration and transformation of
antimony in groundwater.

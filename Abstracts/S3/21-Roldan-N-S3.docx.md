<p style=text-align:justify>Several methodologies have been studied to determine the species of
antimony (Sb) present in Glucantime®. However, these techniques have
certain disadvantages, such as a low resolution between
N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMG-Sb(V)) and inorganic pentavalent Sb (iSb(V)).
Furthermore, there is a problem regarding the stability of inorganic
trivalent Sb (iSb(III)) during sample treatment. The main aim of this
work was to develop an analytical methodology for the separation of Sb
species of NMG-Sb(V), iSb(V), and iSb(III) in Glucantime®. To achieve
this, a methodology was developed based on anion exchange High
Performance Liquid Chromatography Hydride Generation Atomic Fluorescence
(HPLC-HG-AFS) using gradient elution mode with different concentrations
of Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>EDTA as the mobile phase. The results show that 0.473 mM
Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>EDTA should be used for 1.20 min as the first mobile phase for
the separation of NMG-Sb(V), which should then be changed to 20 mM for
the elution of the inorganic species. The results also reveal that
iSb(III) content may be underestimated when sample filtration is used as
the previous separation step. Instead of filtration, this study
demonstrates that adjustment to pH 9 and dilution in deionized water are
a better strategy to determine the iSb(III) content. This method proves
to be reproducible for application in urine samples from rats injected
intraperitoneally with NMG-Sb(V).

<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony is a cumulative toxic element with no known biological function
and its physicochemical and toxic properties depend on its binding form
and oxidation state. All this information emphasizes the importance of
identifying and quantifying the chemical forms of antimony to provide
comprehensive information about its toxicity and environmental
relevance. In the aqueous environment, inorganic antimony mainly appears
in the oxidation states +V and +III. In natural, non-contaminated
waters, extremely low concentrations of total antimony are usually
quantified. Direct speciation analysis, in this case, is practically
impossible. So, many of the procedures for the selective
separation/preconcentration and quantification of antimony species in
natural waters are based on the coupling of a selective separation
technique with a sensitive detection method.

<p style=text-align:justify>During the past years, separations and preconcentrations based on cloud
point extraction (CPE) are becoming an important and practical
application of the use of surfactants in analytical chemistry. The
technique is based on the property of most non-ionic surfactants in
aqueous solutions to form micelles and become turbid when heated to the
cloud point temperature (CPT). Above the CPT, the micellar solution
separates in a surfactant-rich phase of a small volume and in a diluted
aqueous phase, in which the surfactant concentration is close to the
critical micellar concentration (CMC). Any analyte solubilized in the
hydrophobic core of the micelles, will separate and become concentrated
in the small volume of the surfactant-rich phase. Metallic elements can
be extracted to the surfactant-rich phase, trapped in the hydrophobic
micellar core, in the form of hydrophobic complexes that are formed
between the metal ion and an appropriate chelating agent under adequate
conditions.

<p style=text-align:justify>The aim of the present work is to use an optimized CPE procedure for the
selective separation/preconcentration of Sb(III) prior to its
quantification by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS).
In this procedure, ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) is used
as the chelating agent and Triton X-114 (TX-114) as the extracting one.
Potential factors affecting the CPE separation/preconcentration of
Sb(III) are investigated in detail. A certified reference material for
trace elements in riverine water SLRS-4 is used for checking the
accuracy of the method for the total antimony determination after
reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III). Finally, the method is applied to the
speciation of inorganic antimony in non-contaminated natural waters
(well and lake waters).

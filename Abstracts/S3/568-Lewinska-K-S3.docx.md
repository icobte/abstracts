<p style=text-align:justify>Soil contamination with metals and metalloids, in particular Sb, in
shooting ranges becomes a matter of increasing environmental concern.
Very high total concentrations of Sb in shooting range soils were
reported for instance from , , and . In this study we examined a release
of Sb into pore water from shooting range soils under oxidized and
waterlogged conditions, in a 140-day incubation experiment. Five soil
samples were collected from two complexes of shooting ranges in Oleśnica
and Wrocław. The concentrations of Sb in soils were in the ranges: 4.15- 89.6
mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Soils were treated with green waste compost and deferrisation
sludge prior to incubation. Additionally, the effects of treatment with
acid and lime were examined. Pore water was collected 5 times with
MacroRhizon suction samplers, and Sb concentrations in water were
measured. Sb speciation in pore water, that involved Sb III and Sb V,
was determined by ICP MS-HPLC. Additionally, five operationally defined
fractions of Sb in soil solid phase were determined by sequential
extraction before and after incubation. The study confirmed a relatively
high concentrations of Sb in pore water of shooting range soils, that in
all cases exceeded 10 μg∙L<sup>-1</sup> set as a threshold for satisfying quality
underground water. The waterlogging considerably reduced final Sb
concentrations in pore water, irrespectively of the kind of
pretreatment, except for a temporal increase in Sb solubility in two
soils. Suchresults illustrate ambiguity of Sb behaviour in soils.
Therefore, applicability of any treatments designed for remediation of
shooting range soils should be thoroughly examined in relation to the
properties of those particular soils. Sb III was negligible in pore
water of oxidized soils, while its share in pore water of waterlogged
soils was considerable and tended to increase with prolonged incubation.
The highest concentrations of Sb III in pore water were found in
waterlogged acid-treated soils, and also in limed soils. Finally, this
research allowed us to conclude that sequential extraction did not prove
to be a suitable tool for examining the changes in Sb and As binding in
sandy shooting range soils, mainly because of large heterogeneity of
soils and amendments.

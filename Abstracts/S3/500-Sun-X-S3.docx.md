<p style=text-align:justify>Mine tailings are usually fine particles that discarded as wastes during
mining processes. Although these materials are considered low quality
for extractions, they contain a considerable amount of metal(loid)s. It
has been reported that there are more than 8 billion tons of tailings in
U.S., 4 billion tons in former Soviet Union, and more than 6 billion in
China. Thus, the storage of these hazardous wastes is a serious
environmental concern and received extensive attentions globally. To
reduces its risk, bioremediation was emerged as a promising method for
re-extraction or stabilization of the metals. One of the obstacles,
however, is that tailings are usually characterized as low organic
content, low nutrient, and high metal concentrations. Indigenous
microbial community, however, was adapted to the extreme environmental
condition by adopting survival strategies, such as nitrogen fixation.
Nitrogen fixation, which converts nitrogen gas to ammonium, is a
essential natural process that provide nitrogen source to the
ecosystems. As an marconutrient for all life forms, the bio-available
nitrogen content limits the tailing restoration and reclamation. Thus,
understanding the nitrogen fixation potential is necessary for
bioremediation process. Our knowledge regarding how does the heavy
metal(loid)s impact the nitrogen fixation process in tailings is still
sparse.

<p style=text-align:justify>In the current study, tailing and soil samples from five representative
mining areas across the southern China were collected and analyzed. The
geochemical analysis revealed significantly elevated metal
concentrations, along with reduced organic carbon and nitrogen contents
in tailings. Multivariate analysis suggested that both As and Sb
contents were the key factors in shaping both total and nitrogen fixing
microbial community compositions, and thus the community structure were
distinct between tailings and soils. Cluster I nitrogen fixers,
including members of <i>Burkholderiales, Rhizobiales, and
Xanothomonadales</i>, were enriched and identified as the core microbiome
in tailings. Despite the higher relative nitrogenase gene (<i>nif</i>H)
abundance, nitrogen fixation potential in tailings were significantly
lower than that in soils. The result of the current study suggested that
metal(loid)s contamination, along with the oligotrophic conditions,
posit strong suppression on microbial activity and impairs key
environmental processes, such as nitrogen fixation.

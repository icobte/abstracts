<p style=text-align:justify><strong>Introduction:</strong> Antimony (Sb) is a naturally occurring metalloid.
Anthropogenic activities have caused elevated levels of Sb in soil. Sb
is a toxic element and Sb(III) is much more toxic than Sb(V). However,
Sb(V) is the dominant speciation in field soil. Thus using Sb(III) to
study Sb toxicity will greatly overrate its toxicity and has a little
ecological relevance for assessing hazard posed by Sb in real life
scenarios. The springtail <i>Folsomia candida</i> has been extensively used
as an ecologically relevant model organism because its high sensitivity.
The interest on toxicity of Sb has increased in recent decades, however,
data on toxicity of Sb to springtails are fairly limited and existing
studies did not consider effects of various soil properties and long
aging time. As all know, these two factors could significantly influence
metal toxicity and should be considered for the purpose of toxicity
assessment. To address this, the chronic toxicity of Sb(V) to <i>Folsomia
candida</i> were evaluated following ISO guideline in the laboratory
studies.

<p style=text-align:justify><strong>Materials and methods:</strong> Ten types of soil, representing typical
agricultural soils in China, were used as test soils. The Sb(V) were
artificially added into soils and nominal concentrations were set up as
400â€“12800 mg/kg. After aging Sb-treated soils for 150 d, the total Sb
and water soluble Sb concentrations were measured, and springtails were
exposed to soils for 28 d. At the end of test, the number of
reproduction were counted. The EC<sub>50</sub> (concentrations causing 50%
inhibition) values are calculated using Logistic curve.

<p style=text-align:justify><strong>Results:</strong> The toxicity of Sb significantly differed between ten
soils, closely relating to distinct variations in water soluble Sb. The
EC<sub>50</sub> values based measured total Sb ranged from 1735 mg/kg to 13680
mg/kg, which corresponded to a 8-fold variation among ten soils.
Correlation analysis showed that EC<sub>50</sub> values correlated significantly
and positively with clay, organic matter, free Fe and Al oxides,
amorphous Fe oxides, indicating decreased toxicity with increasing
contents of these soil constituents. The EC<sub>50</sub> values significantly and
negatively correlated with pH and CaCO<sub>3</sub>. The prediction models were
further developed using regression analysis. The results indicated that
free Fe oxides was the most important single factor in predicting Sb
toxicity, explaining 89.3% of toxicity variance, and the inclusion of
clay in this model could best explain the toxicity variance (95.9%).
Soil pH and organic matter could also well explain the toxicity
variance.

<p style=text-align:justify><strong>Conclusions:</strong> This study not only demonstrated the significant
toxicity differences of Sb to springtails among soils, but also
developed quantitative relationships using key soil properties. It
should be noted that the prediction models was based on soils aged for
150 d which made Sb equilibrate sufficiently in soil, which allow
prediction of Sb toxicity in a wide range of soils and are helpful to
establish soil-specific quality criteria.

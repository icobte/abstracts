<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) has been an underappreciated element of environmental
concern, until the last decade. The ever-increasing industrial
activities such as mineral exploration and extraction liberate extremely
high concentrations of Sb. Improved awareness of Sb exposure pathways
and toxicity has motivated recent studies on the biogeochemistry of Sb.
Nevertheless, compared with arsenic, an element in the same group in the
periodic table, Sb biotransformation and mobility in the environment are
much less understood.
<p style=text-align:justify>Sb exists mainly in two oxidation states in the environment. Sb(III) is
prevalent in anoxic environments, whereas Sb(V) dominates under oxic
conditions. The redox transformation of Sb generally involves
microorganisms. Anaerobic microbiological Sb(V) respiration is a newly
discovered process regulating the Sb redox transformation in soils.
However, little is known about the role microbiological Sb(V)
respiration plays in the fate of Sb in the subsurface, especially in the
presence of sulfate and electron shuttles. Herein, we enriched a Sb(V)
reducing microbiota (SbRM) from the subsurface near an active Sb mine.
    SbRM was dominated by genus <i>Alkaliphilus</i> (18-36%), <i>Clostridiaceae</i>
    (17-18%), <i>Tissierella</i> (24-27%), and <i>Lysinibacillus</i> (16-37%). The
incubation results showed that SbRM reduced 88% of dissolved Sb(V) to
Sb(III), but the total Sb mobility remained the same as in the abiotic
control, indicating that SbRM alone did not increase the total Sb
release, but regulated the Sb speciation in the subsurface. Micro X-ray
fluorescence (Î¼-XRF) analysis suggested the association of Sb and Fe,
and electron shuttles such as anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic disodium
salt (AQDS) markedly enhanced the Sb release due to its ability to
facilitate Fe mineral dissolution. Sb L-edge and S K-edge X-ray
absorption near edge structure (XANES) results demonstrated that
indigenous SbRM immobilized Sb via Sb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>3</sub> formation, especially in a
sulfur-rich environment.


<p style=text-align:justify>Our study shows that Sb(V) respiring microbiota play an important role
in Sb redox transformation in the subsurface. This conclusion provides a
plausible explanation for the occurrence of high Sb(III) in paddy soils
and subsurface groundwater. The new insights into Sb biotransformation
warrant an extensive investigation of Sb(V) respiring reduction under
different environmental conditions.

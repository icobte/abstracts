<p style=text-align:justify>The accumulation of arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) by rice plants posed
a great health risk to the residents around Xikuangshan, China, the
world largest active Sb mining area. In this study, the pollution
assessment of As and Sb in paired soil-rice samples was evaluated on the
basis of field survey research. Moreover, the speciation and location of
the these two metalloids in soil and rice samples were analyzed by the
combination of wet chemistry, laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), synchrotron-based micro X-ray
fluorescence mapping (μ-XRF) and micro X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (μ-XANES) spectroscopy. The field survey indicated the paddy
soil around studied areas was co-polluted by Sb (5.91-322.35 mg kg-1)
and As (0.99-57.21 mg kg-1). Although the higher soil Sb concentration
was observed, rice accumulated more As than Sb, indicating the higher
bioavailability of As. In the rice grains, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA)
was the predominant species and the percentage of inorganic As species
was 19%–63%. According to µ-XRF mapping of the grain section, most of As
were distributed and concentrated in the husk and bran part (mainly
inorganic As) as well as in the embryo (As(III) and DMA). Sb distributed
similarly to As in rice grain based on LA-ICP-MS. The results deepened
our understanding about As and Sb pollution around Sb mining area.

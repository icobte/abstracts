<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic and antimony are well known toxic metalloids in the environment.
The main goal of this work was to evaluate the effects of arsenic and
antimony on the growth, anatomy, and morphology, and cell development of
cultural plants. We have focused on the analysis of the negative effects
of these metalloids on the roots of maize (<i>Zea mays</i> L.), mainly on its
primary roots. Plants have been cultivated in hydroponic solutions with
the increasing concentrations of tested metalloids, which correlated
well with the intensity of each observed toxic effect of arsenic or
antimony on the primary roots. We used the software analysis to analyse
the morphological features of roots. Using light microscopy and software
analysis we determined the anatomical characteristics focused on the
tissue and cell level. By fluorescence microscopy we observed the
development of the cell wall modifications in the endodermis and
exodermis of primary root. Spectrophotometrically we determined the
concentration of anthocyanins and using light microscopy we observed
their location and visual difference. The most important outcomes were a
reduction in the length of the primary roots even at the metalloids
concentration of tenth of micromoles; changes in the area and the number
of cells in each plant tissue, measured at the level perpendicular to
the axis of the roots. Moreover, we observed both the changes of the
anthocyanin concentration or their intracellular location in the whole
root system. Additionally, the presence of both metalloids resulted
in the changed cell wall composition. Predominantly, the deposition of
material of apoplasmic barriers occured into the cell walls of cortical
cells of the primary roots. We also observed the ontogenetic changes of
endodermal and exodermal cells of primary roots dependent on the applied
concentration of arsenic and antimony.

<p style=text-align:justify>Conclusion: The plant roots are sensitively responding even to very low
concentrations of arsenic and antimony. The morphological reactions are
complex on the level of cells, tissues and organs and further
investigation will be needed to understand the control network system
maintaining the homeostasis of the whole plant after influence of toxic
metalloids.

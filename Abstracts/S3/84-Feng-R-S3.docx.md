<p style=text-align:justify>Pollution by multiple heavy metals (metalloids) in soil is a common
problem and it has been shown to not be easy to synchronously reduce the
uptake of multiple metals or metalloids into edible parts of crops. At
the moment, the technologies to reduce antimony (Sb) uptake in crops are
also scarce. This study attempted to use exogenous iron and water
management to synchronously reduce the uptake of Sb, arsenic (As),
cadmium (Cd) by rice plants. A pot experiment was set up using a Sb and
Cd co-contaminated soil which was treated with 5 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, 10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>
and 20 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> FeCl<sub>3</sub> (Experiment I), and treated with flooding,
intermittent irrigation and dry farming (Experiment II). Since
unsuitable water management will result in As accumulation in crops even
when As concentrations in soil are not high, we also monitored the As
concentration in the soil, soil solution and in different plant tissues.
Our results showed that long-term irrigation resulted in an increase in
Sb and As concentrations in the soil solution at the early stage of
plant growth. In general, the addition of Fe had a negative effect on
the Sb and As concentrations in the soil solution and grains, but did
not have a negative effect on their available concentrations in soil and
the concentrations in the shoots and husks. 20 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> FeCl<sub>3</sub>
promoted rice fresh biomass but did not affect the yield and essential
element concentrations in the grains of this rice plant. Lower soil
moisture also decreased the Sb and As concentrations but increased Cd
concentration in the soil solution and grains (including their available
concentrations in the soil). Lower soil moisture also decreased fresh
biomass and most essential nutrient elements in the grains. The addition
of FeCl<sub>3</sub> facilitated the formation of Fe/Mn plaques, but lower soil
moisture only facilitated the manganese plaque formation. Iron plaque
formation under FeCl<sub>3</sub> treatments could constrain As but showed little
effects on the immobilization of Cd and Sb. In contrast, lower soil
moisture facilitated the concentration of Cd on the Mn plaque. In
conclusions, although FeCl<sub>3</sub> in most cases could reduce the As and Sb
concentrations in the grains, it also resulted in the accumulation of
grain Cd under the 10 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> FeCl<sub>3</sub> treatment. Soil moisture is a
vital factor to control the uptake of As, Cd and Sb in rice plants and
unsuitable water management practices could lead to the As accumulation
even at very lower As concentration in soil.

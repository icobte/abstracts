<p style=text-align:justify>Mining and metallurgic processes are the most crucial causes of heavy
metal pollution in the Chinese soils. The contaminated soils and
sediments in Chenzhou, Hunan province in the South of China.
Contamination of many different heavy metals is reported. Antimony (Sb)
are present in various polluted sites. A better process description of
the sorption processes of antimony in contaminated soils and sediments
is needed. Therefore, an optimization of existing analysis techniques
are recommended for the determination of the free antimony present in
the samples.
<p style=text-align:justify>In this study, the ability to use the Donnan Membrane Technique for
oxy-anions speciation was tested, more in particular for free antimony.
The method was studied with artificial antimony solutions at different
background concentrations, with different antimony species and with
various antimony concentrations. It was concluded that high
concentrations of antimony and background electrolyte concentrations
tend to block the migration of antimony through the anion exchange
membrane. Since the equilibria were not reached, the time needed for
equilibrium was calculated using the obtained data and varied from 13
days to 126 days. The longest equilibrium times, e.g. 126 days, were
    attributed to the slow migration of the neutral species Sb(OH)<sub>3</sub>. Field
DMT experiments for anions were performed in different rivers in
Chenzhou, in Hunan Province. A high percentage of free antimony was
present in the river systems and the attachment of Sb to dissolved
organic carbon was suggested.

<p style=text-align:justify>The desorption behaviour was determined by batch sorption tests for the
total amount of antimony and for the two species Sb(III) and Sb(V),
using the HPLC-ICP-MS. The behaviour was tested under different pH
    values and varying CaCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations. As a conclusion, high
distribution constants Kdes seem to be attributed to the strong
adsorption on the soils and irreversible sorption behaviour of Sb. A
clear effect of iron oxides and the initial Sb concentration present in
the soil is observed. A change in pH and desorption solution
    concentration (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) show a rather variable impact on the desorption
behaviour. Often, it has been assumed that antimony (Sb) and arsenic
(As) have the same behaviour in the environment.

<p style=text-align:justify>Antimonite (Sb(III)) contamination has raised global concern due to its
high toxicity. This study investigated the oxidation and sequestration
of Sb(III) from solution onto newly formed biogenic Mn oxides (BMO),
using batch experiments and spectroscopic analyses. Kinetic experiments
indicated that Sb(III) was quickly oxidized and sequestrated after 10
min by BMO at a pH of 7.0. Bacterial activity in BMO did not
significantly affect Sb(III) sequestration. X-ray photoelectron
spectrometer (XPS) analysis indicated that Sb(V) was the only species
remaining in the solid phase after the reaction of Sb(III) with BMO.
Chemical extraction experiments with the (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> and
NH<sub>2</sub>OHÂ·HCl showed that the dominant fractions of Sb(III) after the
reaction included a Mn oxides bound fraction and residual fraction. XRD
results further indicated that the rapid oxidation of Sb(III) by BMO
contributed to the production of Mn(II) antimonate precipitates. The
formation of less reactive Mn(III) blocked Sb(V) adsorption on the BMO
surface. These results provide important experimental evidence related
to the effect of BMO on the environmental behavior of Sb(III). The study
concludes that BMO plays a key role in sequestration of environmental
Sb(III).

<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb), a metalloid that exists in nature as a trace element, has
long been used extensively in various types of industrial applications.
Sb is a potentially toxic element and can be taken up by agricultural
crops. However, the mechanisms through which Sb(III) affects plants
remain poorly understood. To explore the effects of Sb(III) on wheat,
responses of physical growth properties, enzyme activities and gene
expression were examined using hydroponic growth conditions. The impact
of Sb(III) on wheat roots was more serious than that on wheat shoots
when the length of the plant tissue was the endpoint. In roots, SOD
contributes to Sb tolerance by eliminating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas SOD and POD
play an important role in defense against oxidative damage in shoots.
The root length, root fresh weight and NRAMP1 gene expression at 1 mg
L<sup>-1</sup> were the most relevant indicator to exposure concentration, the
most sensitive inhibitory EC<sub>50</sub> (50% effect concentration) endpoint,
and the most sensitive indicator, respectively. The genes HMA2 and IRT1
were upregulated but less sensitive than NRAMP1.

<p style=text-align:justify>Earthworms, as one of the most widely distributed invertebrates in soil,
which make up the largest amount of animal biomass in soil, are critical
to ecosystem services and functions. Earthworms are usually
considered as biological indicators to predict the bioavailability of Sb
in soil and an important component of ecological risk assessments.
Avoidance tests can be used as a kind of quick and cost-effective method
for assessing contaminants in soils. Laboratory experiments of
earthworms with series of concentrations of antimony (Sb) spiked
agricultural soil were conducted in a climatron to study the chronic
toxicity and avoidance response of Sb on <i>Eisenia
Fetida</i>.
The mortality rates and growth inhibition of 28d culture increased
significantly when the level of Sb in the soils above 500 mg/kg. The
bioaccumulation of Sb by earthworms increased with the increasing concentration of Sb in the
soils, and there were no statistically significant increases in the
level of Sb of the soils under 800 mg/kg. For <i>Eisenia
Fetida</i>, significant differences(P&gt;0.05) were found in the distribution of the
worms between the untreated sides and the sides with treated soil, the
avoidance response by worms decreased with the increasing concentration
of Sb addition. The growth inhibition rates and bioaccumulation were
both significantly correlated with the exposure dose, and might be used
as sensitive indicator for ecological risk assessment of soils. This
study provided toxicological data that can contribute to the development
of Eco-SSLs for Sb, as well.

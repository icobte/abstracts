<p style=text-align:justify>Due to potential hazardous effects, understanding the fate of antimony
(Sb) in soils is essential. In soils, Sb(V) and Sb(III) are the main
oxidation states. Both Sb(V) and Sb(III) can be strongly sorbed onto
iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) hydroxides, by inner- or outer sphere
surface complexation and this can be described by surface complexation
modelling. It is hypothesized that Sb in soils originating from
historical contamination may be less mobile than recently added Sb. The
mechanism of this so-called ageing can be attributed to solid-state
diffusion of Sb into the soil matrix or to incorporation into the Fe
(hyd)roxide crystal lattice, both leading to Sb fixation. The aims of
this study were (i) to relate time-dependent changes in the Sb mobility
in soils to the Sb speciation and coordination environment in the solid
phase by use of Sb K-edge XANES/EXAFS spectroscopy and (ii) to describe
the solubility of Sb in soils by surface complexation modelling with the
CD-MUSIC model for ferrihydrite.

<p style=text-align:justify>Nine soil samples with a range in soil organic carbon concentration,
CaCO<sub>3</sub> , pH and amorphous Fe and Al concentration were amended with 500
mg Sb(V) kg<sup>-1</sup> via a stock solution of KSb(OH)<sub>6</sub>. This high
concentration was needed to ensure good quality of the Sb K-edge EXAFS
spectra and is a good proxy for Sb-contaminated soils. Model soil
hydroxides (hydrous Fe and Al oxides) were prepared and spiked with
Sb(V) at a Sb to Fe/Al ratio of 0.1. The samples were incubated at 20Â°C
for 6 months at field-moist conditions. To evaluate changes in Sb
sorption over time, freshly spiked samples were compared with the
6-month aged soil samples. The concentrations of Sb in the soil pore
water decreased on average by a factor of three in the aged soils
compared to Sb concentrations in the pore water of freshly contaminated
soils. This resulted in increased solid:liquid distribution coefficients
for both the spiked soils and the Sb(V) spiked Fe hydroxide samples
(ferrihydrite), but not for the Al hydroxide. In the soils, the pH
remained constant, however, in 2 soils, a pH drift towards lower pH was
observed. The solid phase speciation analysis showed that over time and
in all samples the redox speciation of the added Sb(V) did not change.
No precipitation of ferric or calcium antimonates in the soil samples
occurred. Preliminary results of the EXAFS modelling showed that the
added Sb(V) is adsorbed to both Fe as Al hydroxides in the soil samples
and that, with ageing, the Sb(V) coordination environment changes in the
second shell. These changes were observed also for the Sb(V) spiked
ferrihydrite, but not for the Al hydroxide, possibly indicating that Fe
hydroxides are controlling Sb ageing in soils.

<p style=text-align:justify>At the conference, further EXAFS modelling of these results will be
presented. Furthermore, the EXAFS data will be used to constrain a
surface complexation model to describe Sb(V) solubility in soils.

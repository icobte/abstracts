<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is nitrogen-group element which has similar valence
electron configurations and chemical speciation to arsenic (As). As the
ninth-most mined metal worldwide, a large quantity of Sb and
Sb-contained compounds have been released into the environment. Sources
of Sb release include abrasion from brake linings, use as flame
retardants, plastic production, mining, refining and shooting
activities. Though the ecotoxicity of Sb is not well known, Sb(III)
compounds are generally considered to be more toxic and mobile than
Sb(V), similar to that of As. Therefore, distribution, speciation,
toxicity and bioavailability of Sb in various environmental compartments
are considered to be primary controlling factors for human and ecosystem
health.

<p style=text-align:justify>To investigate Sb distribution and biogeochemical characteristics in
contaminated soils, we collected three different types of
Sb-contaminated soil samples in South Korea: 1) Sb refining factory, 2)
Sb waste landfill site, and 3) military shooting range. Mineralogy and
speciation of Sb were investigated using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and
x-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) analysis. Metagenomic analysis
was used to characterize the microbial community compositions. Citric
acid extraction and sequential extraction were also used for Sb fraction
analysis. Soil samples adjacent to Sb refining factory and antimony
waste landfill site generally represented higher Sb concentration than
the shooting rage and showed significant change of Sb concentration with
depth. We will discuss Sb speciation in these different types of
contaminated soils. These results will be correlated to microbial
community dynamics analyses.

<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is ubiquitously present mainly as Sb(III) and Sb(V) in the
environment as a result of natural processes and human activities. LC-MS
and HG-AFS are commonly used in the analysis of Sb content and
speciation. However, their high prices and immobility characteristics
limit the spread of these methods. Due to the unique capability of
pre-concentrating analytes at/in the working electrode surface,
electrochemical stripping analysis has been recognized as one of the
most convenient choices for measuring trace metal ions. But except for
the determination on its total concentration, the speciation
determination of Sb(III) and Sb(V) by electrochemical analysis has not
yet been realized in the same solution without adding any
oxidizer/reductant or using complex mathematical calculations, which is
mainly because of the significant difference between the electrochemical
activities of Sb (III) and Sb (V) and the difficulty in separating the
electrochemical signals of Sb(III) and Sb(V).

<p style=text-align:justify>The theoretical research related to photooxidation characteristic of
Sb(III) is widely studied in recent years, but this feature is not well
used yet. This research, based on the photooxidation characteristic of
Sb(III) and the electrochemical activity difference between Sb(III) and
Sb(V), realized the determination of Sb species in one electrolyte
solution by anodic stripping square wave voltammetry (AS-SWV) without
adding any enthetic oxygenant. The electrolyte solution used in this
research was 2.0mol/L HCl. Under this condition, Sb(III) had an obvious
anodic stripping peak at the enrichment potential of -0.4V. While an
obvious stripping peak of Sb(V) was observed under a more negative
enrichment potential of -0.9V. Therefore, the interference of Sb(V) on
Sb(III) determination can be avoided under the enrichment potential of
-0.4V. After the determination of Sb(III), the whole system was exposed
to ultraviolet light for a suitable time to make sure all Sb(III) was
oxidized to Sb(V). Then Sb(V) was detected under the enrichment
potential of -0.9V, which represented the total Sb concentration
(Sb(tot)) in solution. The original Sb(V) concentration was calculated
by difference subtraction method with the results of Sb(tot) and
Sb(III). The linear range of Sb(III) and Sb(tot) were 0.6 to 1.5μmol/L
and 0.8 to 10.0μmol/L, with the detection limits of 4.21nmol/L and
5.05nmol/L, respectively. This method had been successfully applied to
Sb speciation and concentration determination in lake water and seawater
samples.

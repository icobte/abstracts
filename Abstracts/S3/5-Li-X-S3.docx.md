<p style=text-align:justify>Tartaric acid is often used to form complexes with and stabilize
dissolved Sb(III) in adsorption studies. Sb(III) mobility in natural
aquatic environments is generally enhanced by dissolved organic matter.
Competition between such low molecular organic acid complexation and
adsorption of Sb(III) has received little attention, which prompted us
to measure Sb(III) adsorption by iron oxyhydroxide adsorbents commonly
used in water treatment plants. Sb K-edge X-ray absorption fine
structure spectra gave Sb–O and Sb–Fe distances and coordinations
compatible with a bidentate binuclear inner-sphere complex with trigonal
Sb(O,OH)<sub>3</sub> polyhedra sharing corners with Fe(O,OH)<sub>6</sub> octahedra and a
bidentate mononuclear inner-sphere complex with Sb(O,OH)<sub>4</sub> tetrahedra
at alkaline pH. Experimental batch titration data were fitted using the
charge-distribution multi-site surface complexation (CD-MUSIC) model,
taking competitive effects for the organic ligand into consideration.
The adsorption efficiency at acid–neutral pH decreased as the Sb(III)
concentration increased. The CD-MUSIC adsorption model indicates that
this was solely caused by strong competition from tartrate complexation
with adsorption constants up to three orders of magnitude (logK units)
higher than the iron oxyhydroxide adsorption constants without taking
this competition into account. The study provides consistent CD-MUSIC
surface complexation stability constants, allowing the new database to
be used to model reliably adsorption of toxic oxyanions in anoxic
aqueous environments, in particular also to model yet difficult to
understand competition between Sb(III) and As(III).

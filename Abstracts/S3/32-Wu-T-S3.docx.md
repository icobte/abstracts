<p style=text-align:justify>Low molecular weight phenolic acids (LMWPAs) are active components of
natural organic matter (NOM), whose redox reactions may exert
substantial influence on the speciation and mobility of trace metals in
soils. The mechanism of the interactions between NOM and antimony (Sb)
was previously unraveled under sunlight, while remained poorly
understood in the absence of light. In our study, the combination of wet
chemistry, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy
and density functional theory (DFT) based calculations were applied to
explore the mechanism of Sb(III) oxidation induced by various LMWPAs and
their effect on Sb(III) adsorption on goethite in the dark. The results
indicated that Sb(III) was rapidly oxidized to Sb(V) in the presence of
LMWPAs in neutral and alkaline conditions. The reactive oxygen species
(hydrogen peroxide) and quinone species (the semiquinone radical and
oxidized forms of LMWPAs) were the main contributors to the oxidation.
According to DFT based calculations, the bond dissociation enthalpy
(BDE) of the phenolic hydroxyl groups is well correlated with the
Sb(III) oxidation rate constant, which is in line with its pro-oxidant
property towards Sb(III) through the production of semiquinone radical.
The significant inhibition of Sb adsorption on goethite as the pH
increased was observed. Except for the competitive adsorption by LMWPAs,
the inhibition also resulted from the extensive Sb(III) oxidation in the
suspension and the lower Sb(V) sorption capacity of goethite at higher
pH. Besides, the edge-sharing inner-sphere complexes were formed between
Sb and goethite regardless of the presence of LMWPAs. The findings of
this study provided new insights into the role of LMWPAs in Sb(III)
oxidation and their profound effect on Sb immobilization by iron
minerals.

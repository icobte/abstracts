<p style=text-align:justify>The Macleay Catchment in southeastern Australia is home to one of the
largest known antimony (Sb) environmental dispersion plumes in the
world. Historic mining practices in the fluvially energetic upper
catchment has resulted in several thousand tonnes of Sb and As entering
the river system. This plume was discovered during baseline geochemical
sampling of the catchment 20 years ago, initiating a long term,
concerted research effort to understand all aspects of the environmental
fate and behaviour of Sb in the catchment. This included comparisons
with arsenic (As) throughout the investigations. Sediment Sb
concentrations ranged from several thousand mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in the high energy
upper reaches of the catchment, with values of tens of mg kg<sup>-1</sup> 300 km
downstream on the coastal floodplain. Arsenic distribution and relation
to flood events partially diverged from this pattern in the lower
catchment. Both elements showed strong associations with flood patterns
in the coastal floodplain via variogram analysis and calculation of
sediment deposition locations, but dating of sediments suggested As had
a secondary source in the floodplain. Values in river water followed
similar distribution patterns with values hundreds to thousands of times
greater than relevant human and environmental guideline values in the
upper catchment. These values vary strongly with flow regime and season.
Uptake into a range of vegetables and pasture species was low for both
metalloids, with bioconcentration factors ranging from 0 to 0.14.
Bioconcentration factors were consistently higher for As than Sb.
Bioaccessibility in selected soils was typically &lt;3% for Sb, and
slightly higher for As (3.7-6.1%). This patterning was reflected in food
web analyses, in which biodimunition of both metalloids was evident
between trophic levels, but to a greater extent for Sb than As. Arsenic
association with oxyhydroxide phases appears stronger throughout the
catchment, with similar associations playing an increasingly important
role for Sb in the coastal floodplain. Overall, from the same primary
source and on the same time scale, both metalloids have dispersed
hundreds of kilometres in approximately 150 years, with Sb consistently
displaying slower rates of dissolution and re-association with sediments
and soil phases, uptake, trophic transfer and bioavailability throughout
the catchment, compared with As.

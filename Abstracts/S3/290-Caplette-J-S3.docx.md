<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is a naturally occurring element, ranging from 0.3 – 8.4
mg kg<sup>-1</sup> in soils. The US-EPA and EU consider Sb a priority pollutant
of interest, potentially carcinogenic, and volatile stibines are known
genotoxins. Sb contaminated sites, such as mining and smelting and
shooting range sites are potential point sources of volatile Sb into the
environment.

<p style=text-align:justify>Volatile Sb, stibine (SbH<sub>3</sub>), monomethylstibine (MMSb), dimethylstibine
(DMSb), and trimethylstibine (TMSb), can be produced at ambient
temperatures under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and represent an
understudied portion of the biogeochemical cycle of Sb. Few studies have
investigated volatile Sb production in natural media. The production and
formation of volatile Sb in the soil environment is poorly understood
due to the lack of an easy-to-use method for field and lab
quantification.
<p style=text-align:justify>We validated a method for trapping hydrides of Sb (SbH<sub>3</sub> and TMSb)
using activated carbon sorbent material (ACSM). Volatile species of
antimony were synthesized by hydride generation (HG) using standard
solutions made from Sb(III) and trimethylantimony and trapped on ACSM.
Our digestion method is validated for total Sb and recoveries of
digested traps for HG of SbH<sub>3</sub> were 89.58 ± 6.75 % (n = 3) and TMSb
were 92.34 ± 3.94 % (n = 4). This method was used to capture total
volatile Sb emanating from manure-amended (5%) flooded shooting range
soils (Laupen, Switzerland) during an incubation period of 36 days. Our
results show volatile Sb is produced from contaminated shooting range
soils.


<p style=text-align:justify>We observed the *in-situ* production of volatile Sb from two rice paddy
fields in the vicinity of the worlds largest Sb deposit (Xikuangshan
mine, Lengshuijiang, China) using our newly validated trapping method
for total volatile Sb. Our results show that volatile Sb is produced at
low (&lt; 80 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Sb) and high (&lt; 400 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Sb) Sb
contaminated sites in rice paddy fields. Up to 160 ng of Sb was trapped
on the ACSM traps after t = 4 days at the high Sb site. These results
equate up to 390.65 mg ha<sup>-1</sup> y<sup>-1</sup> of volatile Sb being produced from
high Sb paddy fields. The relationship of Sb- volatilization with other
parameters (Sb and multielement concentrations in porewaters and soils,
DOC, anions (e.g., NO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup>, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), pH and redox
potential) will be discussed.

<p style=text-align:justify>We developed an easy and field-deployable method to capture volatile Sb
produced from incubation and field experiments. Our results are the
first to indicate volatile Sb is produced from flooded contaminated
shooting range soils and paddy field sites. As these sites represent
large point sources of Sb and have favorable conditions for bio-
methylation and -volatilization processes, they could be large
contributors of toxic stibines to the environment and influence the
biogeochemical cycling of Sb.

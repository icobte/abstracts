<p style="text-align:justify"><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong> Bioaccumulation of arsenic in rice grain from paddy soils
and contaminatedirrigation water poses a significant health risk to
humans. Inorganic arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen and
chronic exposure of this can cause fatal damage to kidney, brain, heart,
bladder and lungs of millions of people who rely on rice as a staple
food. Therefore, assessing the bioavailability of arsenic from rice is
crucial for understanding human exposure and to reduce the risk of
arsenic-related diseases. In this study, an in vivo assay using swine
was used to measure the bioavailability of arsenic from cooked rice of
twelve genotypes grown in arsenic-contaminated field sites in
Bangladesh. The average arsenic concentrations in each rice genotypes
ranged from 108 ± 4 µg/kg to 580 ± 6 µg/kg. The speciation results
indicate that inorganic arsenic contents varied from 73 to 99% depending
on the varieties. In swine assay, different swine groups were
administered with different arsenic species orally, by intravenous i.e.
injection and fed cooked rice and finally blood arsenic levels were
analyzed by ICP-MS (Agilent technologies) immediately after collection
and arsenic bioavailability from rice was calculated by pharmacokinetic
analysis. This study demonstrates that rice genotypic characters
influenced arsenic bioavailability in rice grain grown in
arsenic-contaminated areas and the bioavailability varied between 25%
and 94%. Results indicate that arsenic in salt tolerant rice genotypes
Binadhan-10 (25%) as well as brown rice genotypes Kheali Boro (35%) and
Local Boro (40%) has lower bioavailability compared to other rice
genotypes. Most commonly cultivated and consumed variety (BRRI dhan28)
has arsenic bioavailability of 70%, which pose significant risk to
consumers. Calculation of maximum tolerable daily intake based on
bioavailable portion from rice was higher than those calculated based on
inorganic and organic arsenic concentration. Thus, arsenic
bioavailability from rice is cultivar dependent and can vary due to
chemical form of arsenic. So, both genotypic characters and speciation
plays an important role in arsenic bioavailability from rice.

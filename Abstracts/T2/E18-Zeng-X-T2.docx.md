<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) and chlorinated solvents such as tetrachloroethene (PCE)
and trichloroethene (TCE) are widespread groundwater contaminants due
to natural processes and/or anthropogenic activities. Common
bioremediation strategies involved in the removal of chlorinated
 solvents often establish suitable redox conditions that facilitate As
 dissolution and mobilization, but the effects of arsenic speciation on
 microbial dechlorination activity remain largely unexplored. In this
 study, we tested the activity of several dechlorinating pure cultures
 at the presence of varying concentrations of Arsenite (As (III)) and
 Arsenate (As (V)). As (III) exhibited more toxic effects than As (V)
 on the tested dechlorinating bacteria, and the presence of either As
 species significantly inhibited microbial dechlorination activity and
 resulted in slower rates and undesirable dechlorination end points. As
 (V) (5 μM and 50 μM) was quickly reduced to As(III) within 24 hours in
 a PCE-dechlorinating microcosm inoculated with aquifer solids. PCE-to
 <i>cis</i>-1,2-dichloroethene (<i>c</i>DCE) dechlorination was not inhibited,
 but the further detoxification of <i>c</i>DCE to ethene was slow and
 incomplete. In the microcosm amended with an initial 50 μM As (V), PCE
 dechlorination was completely stopped at the stage of <i>c</i>DCE and no
 vinyl chloride or ethene was detected. 16S rRNA high-throughput
 sequencing results revealed that the abundance of <i>Dehalococcoides
 mccartyi</i> was decreased by 19.3% and 71.1% when exposed to 5 μM and 50
 μM As(V), respectively, which is consistent with the observed loss in
 <i>c</i>DCE dechlorination activity. These results suggest that As
 con-contamination has a negative impact on the bioremediation of
 chlorinated solvents and the arsenic biogeochemical processes need to
 be taken into consideration during site restoration practice.

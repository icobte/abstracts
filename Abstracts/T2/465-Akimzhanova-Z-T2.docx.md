<p style=text-align:justify>Children can be exposed to potentially toxic elements present in
children’s toys and jewelry through several pathways, with whole
ingestion of contaminated articles being the most severe scenario. There
is some proof that the problem of contaminated toys and jewelry is
recently becoming a more serious issue in developing countries. This may
be because effective legislative efforts in developed countries may have
caused manufacturers of these items focusing on the markets with less
strict legislation and enforcement. However, scientific research on the
presence and bioavailability of potentially toxic elements in toys and
children’s jewelry region has not yet been conducted in most of the
developing countries including the ones in the Central Asian region. The
Central Asian market, also being a good representative of some other
Asian markets, has the majority of its low-cost consumer goods exported
from neighboring manufacturer countries such as the People’s Republic of
China and the Russian Federation. The present ongoing study aims to
investigate the problem of contaminated toys and children’s jewelry in
Kazakhstan (the largest country in Central Asia) to determine whether
there is a serious threat to children’s health resulting from potential
exposure to contaminated toys and jewelry. We will first present total
concentrations (TCs) of selected heavy metals (As, Cd, and Pb) in toys
and children’s jewelry bought on Kazakhstani market as well as some
second-hand jewelry, and then discuss the compliance of these items to
local as well as to international regulatory limits. We will also
conduct bioaccessibility tests (physiologically based <i>in-vitro</i> tests
simulating human exposure) on selected items and then perform a
preliminary risk characterization to identify chemical health risks in
the case of children’s potential exposure to these items. We will
discuss the findings for different categories of children’s items such
as metallic toys & jewelry and toys with paint or coating. We will
provide a statistical investigation of a possible relationship between
total metal concentrations and item properties such as color, price, and
shop category in order to identify specific properties linked to a
higher potential risk. The results will help us to characterize the risk
coming from potential exposure to these items and will form a basis for
the upcoming stages of the present project, namely the application of
modified <i>in-vitro</i> bioaccessibility tests for better estimation of
elemental bioavailability for both short- and long-term exposure, and a
thorough assessment of chemical risk via an implementation of advanced
deterministic and probabilistic tools.

<p style=text-align:justify><sup>*</sup>This presentation is intended to be the second part of the work to be
presented by Prof. Guney’s team on contamination in children’s consumer
goods and its potential adverse health outcomes. In this second part,
the researcher Ms. Akimzhanova will present the initial findings of
their laboratory research on the subject.

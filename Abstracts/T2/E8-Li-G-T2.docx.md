<p style=text-align:justify>Selenium is an essential trace element for many living organisms.
However, it is still not clear about the biogeochemical cycle of
selenium in high soil selenium content area. In this study, an extremely
high selenium tolerant bacteria, <i>Lelliottia amnigena</i> YTB01 were
isolated in Enshi, China, with the minimum IC100 of Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> 35 g/L,
more than previous studies have reported. The <i>Lelliottia amnigena</i>
YTB01 strain genome was sequenced using a PacBio RS II platform and
Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform (BGI, Shenzhen, China). The genome
sequencing identified that <i>Lelliottia amnigena</i> YTB01 is 4,941,692 bp
and has a G+C content of 54.43%, including 4,605 coding genes and 141
ncRNA. Comparison to the genome of <i>Lelliottia amnigena</i> ZB04,
selenocysteine translation elongation factor is specific in YTB01, which
play an important role in regulating selenocysteine biosynthesis.
Furtherly, the KEGG database annotation revealed important metabolic
pathways about selenocysteine synthesis, methyltransferases, DNA repair
(detoxification related), and also showed metabolism of selenium is
coupled with that of nitrogen and sulfur in <i>Lelliottia amnigena</i> YTB01.
Our finding revealed the key mechanisms of selenium metabolism and
detoxification in high selenium tolerant bacteria.

<p style=text-align:justify>Clay minerals, bacteria and humic substances produce mineral-organic
composites in soils and associated environments. The mechanisms of the
binding and competitive adsorption of heavy metals on
bacteria-associated clay mineral complexes have been poorly understood.
Batch sorption, ITC, EXAFS and µ-XRF were applied to investigate the
binding characteristics of Cd and its competition with Pb on
montmorillonite (Mont)-humic acid(HA)-bacteria composites. Additive
sorption and non-additive Cd(II) sorption are observed for the binary
Mont-bacteria and ternary Mont-HA-bacteria composite, respectively. In
the ternary composite, the coexistence of HA and bacteria inhibits Cd
adsorption, suggesting a “blocking effect” between humic acid and
bacterial cells. Large positive entropies, and linear combination
fitting of the EXAFS spectra for Cd adsorbed onto Mont-bacteria and
Mont-HA-bacteria composites, demonstrate that Cd is mostly bound to
bacterial surface functional groups by forming inner-sphere complexes.
The decreased coordination of C atoms around Cd and the reduced
adsorption enthalpies and entropies for the binary mixtures suggested
the transformation of bidentate Cd-carboxyl complexes into monodentate
ones. Stronger competition was observed on clay mineral than on
bacteria–clay composite due to more non-specific sites for heavy metal
adsorption on clay mineral. Both competing heavy metals tended to react
with bacterial fractions in the composite, which was verified by the
higher correlation of Cd (and Pb) with Zn (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.41) elemental
distribution than with Si (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.10). The competitive adsorption
exhibited a lower entropy change (ΔS) at the metal-sorbent interfaces
compared with single-metal adsorption. The understanding on the binding
mechanism of Cd at the bacteria–mineral interfaces from a molecular and
thermodynamic view would have an environmental significance for
predicting the chemical behavior of heavy metals in complex
mineral–organic systems.

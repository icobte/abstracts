<p style=text-align:justify>Nanocrystalline iowaite, a Mg/Fe-based layered double hydroxide (LDH)
intercalated with chloride, was synthesized to evaluate its performance
for arsenic removal from water and to investigate the contributing
dearsenication mechanisms. It is characterized by fast arsenic sorption
rates and has a much higher arsenic uptake capacity than other LDHs that
are commonly used for water dearsenication. The surface adsorption of
the solution arsenic onto the iowaite samples and the anion exchange of
the arsenic in solution with chloride, which is originally in the
iowaite interlayers, are the primary mechanisms for the uptake of
arsenic by iowaite. In addition to the Coulombic attraction between
arsenate/arsenite and positively charged layers of iowaite, the
inner-sphere complexation of arsenic with Fe (instead of Mg) in the
iowaite layers is responsible for the formation of more stable and
stronger arsenic bonds, as indicated by both XPS and EXAFS analyses.
Specifically, bidentate-binuclear and monodentate-mononuclear As-Fe
complexes were detected in the arsenate removal experiments, whereas
bidentate-mononuclear, bidentate-binuclear, and monodentate-mononuclear
As-Fe complexes were present for the arsenite-treated iowaite samples.
This study indicates that Nano-iowaite is a promising material for the
treatment of both industrial wastewaters with arsenic concentrations
over several hundreds of mg/L and contaminated natural waters with a
comparatively lower range of arsenic concentrations (typically from
several hundreds of Âµg/L to several mg/L). For industrial-scale
applications, Nano-iowaite must be synthesized as microspheres with a
macro porous structure or as a homogeneous mixture with other chemically
stable materials, such as quartz sand, so that the material has
sufficient diffusion pathways for arsenic-bearing waters. In terms of
water dearsenication, one limit of Nano-iowaite is that the final
solution is usually alkaline (pH 10 - 11). However, this may be
advantageous when Nano-iowaite is used to treat acidic arsenic-rich
waters from, for example, acid geothermal discharge or acid mine
drainage. By carefully designing the treatment conditions, the final
solution pH could be within the neutral range, and arsenic could be
efficiently removed from water. One problem possibly occurring during
the treatment of acid waters by Nano-iowaite is that it may be not as
stable as in alkaline solutions. A systematic test on the stability of
Nano-iowaite at wider ranges of pH and arsenic concentration needs to be
performed before it will be put into practice in acid water treatment.

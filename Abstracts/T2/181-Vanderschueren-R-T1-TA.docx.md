<p style="text-align:justify">The European Commission Regulation proposed new threshold limits for Cd
in cacao-derived products, which will be enforced on January 1, 2019.
Because Cd in chocolate originates from the cacao beans, the industry
has set a concentration requirement of 0.60 mg Cd kg<sup>-1</sup> dry weight for
cacao beans. It is anticipated that this new requirement will have a
large impact on the cacao market in South and Central America where
cacao bean Cd concentrations are relatively high in comparison to cacao
from other geographical origins (e.g. Africa). Indeed, recent survey
studies indicated that 45 % of the sampled cacao beans in Ecuador
contained concentrations of Cd higher than 0.60 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. The aim of
this study was to identify the Cd distribution within cacao bean tissues
and the potential redistribution of Cd during fermentation. This
knowledge may shed light on possible modifications in the extensive
post-harvest process of cacao to control the Cd concentration in the
final product. Currently only limited and often contradictory
information is available regarding the localization of Cd within the
different cacao bean tissues and the influences of post-harvest
practices such as fermentation on Cd in cacao have not been studied to
date. The distribution of Cd between and within the different tissues of
the cacao bean (the nib or cotyledons, the seed coat or testa and the
radicle), as well as the influence of fermentation on this distribution,
were studied in the two main varieties grown in Ecuador: CCN-51 and
Nacional. Cacao bean samples before and after fermentation were
collected from a full scale fermentation cascade (200 kg) and a lab
scale fermentation set-up (5 kg). Cacao beans for lab scale fermentation
were sourced from a limited number of neighbouring trees to minimize the
variation in elemental composition of the non-processed cacao beans. The
elemental concentrations in the different tissues of unfermented and
fermented cacao beans were analysed through acid digestion followed by
inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis, and the
distribution of elements within the cacao bean was visualized using
laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS). Strong differences were observed
between the elemental compositions of the different tissues. In
unfermented cacao beans, cadmium concentrations were up to 70 % higher
in the testa (Nacional 0.66 mg Cd kg<sup>-1</sup> and CCN51 3.1 mg Cd kg<sup>-1</sup>)
compared to the nib (Nacional 0.39 mg Cd kg<sup>-1</sup> and CCN-51 1.8 mg Cd
kg<sup>-1</sup>). During fermentation, the concentrations of most elements
increased significantly in the testa of the cacao beans. For example,
during full-scale fermentation of CCN-51 cacao, the Cd concentration in
the testa increased from 0.60 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 1.3 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> while the Cd
concentration of the nibs significantly (p&lt;0.05) decreased from 0.49
mg kg<sup>-1</sup> to 0.38 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>. Imaging of cacao bean cross sections by
LA-ICP-MS revealed that the elements were heterogeneously distributed
within the nib and testa. Particularly, a centre zone within the nib
exhibited elevated concentrations of Cd and Cu but this zone was not
visible for Ca, K, Ni, P or Zn. At the conference, both the ICP-MS data
from the full scale fermentation and the LA-ICP-MS images from the lab
scale fermentation will be further shown.

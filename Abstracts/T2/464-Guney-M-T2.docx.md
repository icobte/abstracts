<p style=text-align:justify>The problem of metal contamination in toys and children’s jewelry caught
attention especially after the late 2000s due to several incidents
causing serious adverse health effects for children (including death)
resulting in numerous recalls of consumer goods. Although the attention
from the public, media, legislators, and scientists has led to some
improvements in the area, there still remains much to do. The present
talk aims (1) to briefly discuss the current status of legislations on
the subject, and then (2) to discuss in detail the recent advances and
updates in scientific research in the field. Regarding the legislations,
some minor but significant changes have taken place both in the EU and
the North American regulations within the last decade. Although the
testing approaches differ between individual countries, a general
tendency to adopt the ISO standards for testing children’s consumer
goods could be observed. At the present moment, the problem of toys and
children’s jewelry contamination seems to be moving from developed to
developing countries possibly due to the fact that improved regulations
and enforcement in developed countries lead manufacturers of these items
to look for new markets with weaker regulations and/or enforcement.
Several scientific studies performed within the last decade indicate
that the problem of toys and children’s jewelry contamination is still
present in different parts of the world; and, that the total
concentrations of toxic elements in metallic toys and children’s jewelry
is higher compared to other categories of children’s items. However, it
does not mean that other categories of children’s items are safe.
Bioaccessibility assessment tools remain promising and thus have become
more and more popular for assessing the safety of consumer goods.
Generally, the correlation between total and bioaccessible
concentrations observed by researchers has been weak or non-existent,
therefore, it may be suggested using bioaccessibility values instead of
total metal content for risk characterization as well as for regulatory
purposes. For bioaccessibility measurements, two main types of tests
available are <i>in-vivo</i> and <i>in-vitro</i> tools. <i>In-vitro</i> tests bring
several advantages over <i>in-vivo</i> such as their speed, having easier
setup, costing much less, and avoiding ethical considerations linked to
animal and/or human testing. Existing research areas and challenges in
the field include Ag nanoparticles in consumer goods, contamination in
vintage and second-hand articles, metallic speciation and its analytical
investigation, and the question of reliability of popular rapid
screening methods (e.g. via XRF) over classical analytical techniques
(e.g. total digestion followed by ICP/AAS).

<p style=text-align:justify><sup>*</sup>This presentation is intended to be the first part of the work to be
presented by Prof. Guney’s team on contamination in children’s consumer
goods and its potential adverse health outcomes. As a leading field
expert, with this first part, Prof. Guney would like to introduce the
audience a general view of the current situation in the field.

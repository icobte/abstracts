<p style=text-align:justify>The natural enrichment of arsenic(As) in the shallow groundwater of
Jianghan Plain, central Yangtze River Basin, has been reported. Many
studies have showed the processes related to arsenate reduction, iron
reduction can be involved in As release. However, the biogeochemical
process of sulfate reduction in the high As aquifers is not clearly
understood yet. According to the field groundwater investigation in
Jianghan Plain, the high As(2550 μg/L) and low Fe(II)(1.5 mg/L)
concentration were observed in shallow groundwater. However, previous
studies indicated the As concentration showed positive correlation with
iron concentration, which is related to the reductive dissolution of
As-bearing iron oxides. Therefore, the microbially mediated sulfate
reduction, as one key link in the redox sequence, may be equally
important for the As mobilization in the groundwater, but this
hypothesis remains to be tested. The purposes of this study were to 1)
identify the effects of microbially mediated sulfate reduction process
on the As mobilization and transformation; 2) discriminate the
predominant process responsible for As mobility in high As aquifers with
hydrogeochemical characteristics of high As and low Fe(II). We used the
sediment samples collected from the monitoring well(YLW03) with high As
and low Fe(II) in shallow aquifer at the depth of 20.75 m to design the
75-day incubation experiments under anaerobic condition. The results
indicated that the intense sulfate reduction could indirectly promote
As/Fe(II) release from sediments, which increased to 255.70 μg/L/3.53
mg/L, 285.00 μg/L/5.99 mg/L respectively in the microcosms with acetate
amended and no amendment along with the functional gene(<i>dsrB</i>) copies
increasing to 1.11×10<sup>5</sup>/6.34×10<sup>5</sup> obviously. The sulfate reduction
could also promote arsenate reduction along with the increase of <i>arrA</i>
copies. In addition, the microbially mediated sulfate reduction also
contributed to form thio-As (H<sub>2</sub>AsS<sub>4</sub><sup>-</sup>), which could promote As
release further. Initially, along with the relative abundance of
sulfate-reducing bacteria(SRB) including <i>Desulfomicrobium</i> increasing
to 26.87%/30.58%, As released via the formation of sulfide, which could
reduce the amorphous iron-oxides indirecty. Although the Fe-sulfide
minerals formed simultaneously, they could not consistently inhibit the
mobilization of arsenic. After 14 days of incubation, the relative
abundance of iron-reducing bacteria(FeRB) including <i>Geobacter</i>
increasing to maximum, 10.53%/16.70%, which could contributed to the
poorly crystallized Fe-sulfide minerals and amorphous iron-oxides
translating into pyrite and crystallized iron-oxides via iron reduction.
Although a fraction of As was immobilized transiently, the As released
into the liquid phase again then with the Fe(II) is scavenged finally.
At the end of incubation, methanogens became predominant, which
indicated the evolution of microbial community. According to those
results, sulfate reduction play an important role on As mobilization and
transformation in weakly alkaline groundwater. The sulfate reduction in
<i>in situ</i> environment requires long-time investigation to better
understand the sulfide-based immobilization strategies.

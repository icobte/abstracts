<p style=text-align:justify>Gallium (Ga), indium (In) and thallium (Tl) are regarded as the emerging
contamination elements (ECEs) due to the development of the high-tech
industries. The potential risk of Ga, In and Tl to human health and
environment initiates us to screen soil microorganisms that are tolerant
to Ga, In or Tl for future application, including bioremediation. In
this study, soil samples collected from Taoyuan (PC and SK2 series) and
Yilan (CI series) were used to isolate microorganisms tolerant to Ga, In
or Tl. Bacteria tolerant to Ga, In and Tl in each soil sample were
enriched in basal salt medium (BSM) supplemented with two different
concentrations of Ga, In or Tl by transferring 1/10 volume to fresh
medium (also supplemented with the same concentration of the same
element) every ten days. As results,we obtained 44 candidate bacterial
strains based on their colony morphology and the amount on nutrient agar
after enrichment for 30 days. Among those strains, 23, 14, and 29
isolates can tolerate 200mg L<sup>-1</sup> Ga, In and Tl, respectively.
Additionally, five, four and twelve strains can tolerate only Ga, In and
Tl, respectively. Seven isolates can tolerate both Ga and Tl, two
isolates can tolerate both In and Tl, but none can tolerate both Ga and
In. Interestingly, eight isolates possess ability to tolerate all three
elements. Identification and characterization of these strains are
undergoing. Further investigation on the resistant mechanisms of each
candidate strain shall reveal how they can survive in the presence of
high concentration of ECEs and then candidates for future utilization
can be identified.

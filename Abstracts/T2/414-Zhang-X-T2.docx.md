<p style=text-align:justify>Dachang and Chehe are towns in a polluted mining area in southern China.
There is concern that pollution in these towns could affect the health
of the residents, especially children. To investigate this, hair samples
were collected from 56 children 5â€“13 years old. The samples were
analyzed for seven metals and the results compared with national and
international reference values. As, Cd, Pb, and Zn concentrations in the
exposed group hair samples were elevated. The sources of the metals
could be the polluted mining environment, the high natural geochemical
background concentrations, or a combination of both. The As and Pb
concentrations were higher in hair samples from younger children than
older children, implying that children less than 10 years old may be
more at risk. Elevated As, Cd, Pb, and Zn concentrations in the body
cause the concentrations of the essential elements Cu and Mg to
decrease.

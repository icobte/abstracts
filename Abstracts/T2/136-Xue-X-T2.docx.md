<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic is the most ubiquitous environmental toxin and enters our
environment in many ways, including weathering of rocks, mining,
volcanic activities, herbicides, wood preservatives, feed additives and
so on. Arsenate (As(V)) is the predominant species in the aerobic soils
and be ingested and accumulated by non-target soil organisms via
ingestion and dermal contact. Soil fauna is an important component of
soil ecosystem, and its gut bacteria plays a crucial role in enhancing
the host metabolism, health and immunity. Some studies have focused on
the survival and reproduction of soil animals exposed to arsenic
contamination. However, comprehensive studies of the interactions
between arsenic species and the gut bacterial flora of soil animals have
not been undertaken and relationships between arsenic species and ABGs
in the soil fauna gut are not well understood. In this study, five
important soil organisms involved in organic matter decomposition and
nutrient turnover including the macrofauna (two earthworms) and three
mesofauna (isopoda, enchytraeid and collembolan) were treated with
arsenic. High-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) with 80 primer sets
(79 arsenic biotransformation genes (ABGs), and the bacterial 16S rRNA
gene) was used to investigate the distribution of ABGs in different soil
fauna. The gut microbial community was evaluated by using 16S rRNA gene
amplification and high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that
arsenic can be accumulated by all five soil animal body tissues. The
profiles of ABGs in the gut of different animal species were various,
though genes involved in arsenic reduction and efflux were predominant
in all soil fauna gut. Gut bacterial community of soil fauna were
significantly influenced by arsenic and animal ecological species. In
addition, perturbation of gut microbiota can exert an impact on the
abundance of ABGs. Our study characterizes the first time the
distribution of ABGs in the gut of different soil animals and help
understand the role of gut microbiota in the arsenic biotransformation.

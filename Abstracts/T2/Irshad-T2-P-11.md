<p style=text-align:justify>To date no information is available on impact of goethite biochar on Cd
phytoavailability in Cd contaminated paddy soil. The main objective of current
study was to investigate the effect of amending Cd
contaminated soil with Biochar (BC) and Goethite coated Biochar (GB) at different rates on
phytoavailability of Cd in rice plant. Goethite coated biochar can combine the
benefits of biochar. The application of BC and GB reduced pore water Cd in the
rhizosphere soil throughout the rice growth. GB amendments greatly enhance the
Fe plaque formation on rice root, thus causing a decreased Cd accumulation in
rice plant parts. GB amendments significantly reduced Cd concentration in rice
roots and shoots. Sequential extraction results showed that BC and GB can
enhance the transfer of exchangeable Cd to non exchangeable fractions thus
decreasing the Cd mobility in paddy soils. GB increased the biomass of rice
roots and shoots by increasing the chlorophyll content and gas exchange
attributes. BC and GB application diminishes the oxidative stress in rice plant
caused by Cd toxicity. The findings of the present study demonstrate that
amending the soil with1.5% GB can be a potential remediation method to reduce
accumulation of Cd in rice plants.

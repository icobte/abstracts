<p style=text-align:justify>Rapid industrialization has lead to thermal
power plants and non-ferrous metal smelters producing large amounts of
heavy metal-containing, air-borne particulate matter in some areas of
China. Heavy metal pollutants in the atmosphere cause soil pollution
through depositional processes and pose a potential threat to human
health. Jiyuan City in Henan Province, China produces about 900,000
tonnes of lead annually. Heavy metal contamination of soil and elevated
blood lead levels (BLLs) of local children in Jiyuan have been reported.
In order to investigate the depositional fluxes and time variation of
heavy dust in the atmosphere around the lead smelting pollution area,
atmospheric dust samples were collected for 12 consecutive months near a
large lead smelter in Jiyuan City (YG), near an abandoned lead smelter
faraway from the lead smelter (JLG), and from a place about 23 km from
the smelter as the control (DZ). The average deposition fluxes of Pb,
Cd, Cu, Zn and As at YG were 45.0, 1.62, 4.36, 17.52 and 1.61
kg·km<sup>-2</sup>·30d<sup>-1</sup>, those of JLG were 19.2, 0.382, 1.30, 6.64, 0.789
kg·km<sup>-2</sup>·30d<sup>-1</sup>, and those of DZ were 11.4, 0.116, 0.633, 2.43 and
0.252 kg·km<sup>-2</sup>·30d<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. Obvious variations in temporal
depositional fluxes were observed for samples from YG, with lower
deposition fluxes occurring from May to July and greater depositional
fluxes occurring from January to February. These variations may have
been due to changes in three factors: 1) rainfall; 2) vegetation; and 3)
coal combustion for heating. Winter has less rainfall and ground
vegetation and more coal combustion than in summer, thus resulting in
greater heavy metal deposition than in summer. Results suggest that lead
smelting in Jiyuan resulted in obvious enhancement in heavy metal
deposition, with this enhancement predominantly due to fresh deposition
from the smelter and to a lesser degree the resuspension of polluted
soil particles. The greater depositional flux of JLG compared to the
control indicates that soil heavy metals and other environmental
components still contribute to air quality degradation even after
smelting activity has ceased.

<p style=text-align:justify>Microbial arsenic (As) transformation is important in As biogeochemical
cycles in the environment. More and more bacteria capable of As
transformation have been reported. In this study, a new As-resistant
bacterial strain <i>Leclercia adecarboxylata</i> As3-1 was isolated and its
associated mechanisms in As resistance and detoxification were evaluated
based on genome sequencing and gene annotations. After subjecting strain
As3-1 to media containing arsenate (AsV), AsV reduction occurred and an
AsV-enhanced bacterial growth was observed. In contrast, strain As3-1
lacked arsenite (AsIII) oxidation ability and displayed lower AsIII
resistance than AsV, probably due to its higher AsIII accumulation.
Polymerase chain reaction and phylogenic analysis showed that strain
As3-1 harbored a typical AsV reductase gene (<i>arsC</i>) on the plasmids.
Genome sequencing and gene annotations identified four operons
<i>phoUpstBACS</i>, <i>arsHRBC</i>, <i>arsCRDABC</i> and <i>ttrRSBCA</i>, with additional 8
genes outside the operons that might have involved in As resistance and
detoxification in strain As3-1. Among which, 5 <i>arsC</i> genes were found,
explaining why strain As-1 tolerated high AsV concentrations. Besides
ArsC, TtrB, TtrC and TtrA proteins could also be involved in AsV
reduction and consequent energy acquisition for bacterial growth. Our
data provided a new example of diverse As-regulating systems and
AsV-enhanced growth without ArrA in bacteria, which helps to better
understand the role of As in selecting microbial systems that can
transform and utilize As.

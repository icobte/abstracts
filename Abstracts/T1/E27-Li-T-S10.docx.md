<p style=text-align:justify>Abscisic acid (ABA) is a key phytohormone underlying plant resistance to
toxic metals. However, regulatory effects of ABA on apoplastic transport
in roots and consequences for uptake of toxic metals are poorly
understood. Here, we demonstrate how ABA regulates development of
apoplastic barriers in roots of two ecotypes of <i>Sedum alfredii</i> and
assess effects on cadmium (Cd) uptake. Under Cd treatment, increased
endogenous ABA level was detected in roots of non-hyperaccumulating
ecotype (NHE) due to up-regulated expressions of ABA biosynthesis genes
(<i>SaABA2</i> and <i>SaNCED</i>) but no change was observed in hyperaccumulating
ecotype (HE). Simultaneously, endodermal Casparian strips (CSs) and
suberin lamellae (SL) were deposited closer to root tips of NHE compared
with HE. Interestingly, the vessel-to-CS overlap was identified as an
ABA-driven anatomical trait modified in response to actual conditions.
Results of correlation analyses and exogenous applications of
ABA/Abamine indicate that ABA regulates development of both types of
apoplastic barriers through promoting activities of phenylalanine ammonialyase,
peroxidase and expressions of suberin-related genes (<i>SaCYP86A1</i>,
<i>SaGPAT5</i>, <i>SaKCS20</i>). Using SIET and PTS tracer confirmed that
ABA-promoted deposition of CSs and SL significantly reduced Cd entrance
into root stele. Therefore, maintenance of low ABA levels in HE
suppressed development of apoplastic barrier and maximized Cd uptake via
apoplastic pathway.

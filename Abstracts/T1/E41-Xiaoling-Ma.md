<p style=text-align:justify>Single-particle ICP-MS (SP-ICP-MS) is a qualitative and quantitative ICP-MS
instrument and associated detection method for low-concentration single
particles containing specific elements. Single-particle targets can be either
nanoparticles or PM2.5/PM10, or synthetic ultrafine particles and clathrates, or
the life-saving scientific research frontier cells, algae, viruses and other
living small particle targets. Compared to traditional elemental methods,
SP-ICP-MS technology is fast and efficient and provides more information: it can
measure particle size distribution, number of particles, concentration of
elements inside the particles, and concentration of elements dissolved outside
the particles. Moreover, it is able to distinguish specific particles containing
different elements. The SP-ICP-MS principle is based on measuring the signal
strength and signal width produced by a single particle. The suspended single
particles must be effectively diluted, with a certain interval between the
particles to ensure that only one single particle arrives in the plasma of the
ICP-MS at a time for high-speed cracking, then atomized and ionized, each
particle produces a pulse signal in ICP-MS, and the width and height of the
pulse signal represent the concentration of elements in the particle. The
continuous signal represents the concentration of the dissolved element or
solvent background element.  
When SP-ICP-MS is combined with a customized single-cell injection interface
system and the latest data analysis software system, it can be used for
single-particle analysis of algae, cells, etc. In this case, the technique is
called single-cell ICP-MS. To ensure the reliability of the assay data, the
algae or cells must be intact and bioactive before entering the plasma of the
ICP-MS. Algae or cell granules can be up to 100 microns in diameter and can
easily break or lose their vitality during sample transport, so the single cell
ICP-MS injection system is tailored. In addition, since multiple nanoparticles
may exist in algae or cells, the number of nanoparticles in the cell must be
counted independently or in terms of the number of cells, and a specific setting
is required in software.  
The main content of this report is from the research work of PerkinElmer and its
partners, and introduces the application of PerkinElmer SP-ICP-MS single
particle and single cell analysis in environmental analysis.

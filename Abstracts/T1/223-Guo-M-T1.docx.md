<p style=text-align:justify>Ionic rare earth element (REE) deposits are an important strategic
resource in China, mainly located in Jiangxi, Guangdong and other
provinces in the south of China. Their exploitation by heap leaching has
generated important environmental damages, such as water contamination,
erosion and landslides. The mining processes has been shown to change
the REEs fractionation and distribution in bare tailings. By separated
the different size fractions and using the SEM-EDX to observe the
different particles, we found that there are two main type of
REE-bearing phase in representative particles and fine fractions (2-20
µm, 20-50 µm, 50-200 µm), 1) Ce-bearing phase; 2) mischmetal-bearing
phase with P coexistence. Ce-bearing phase in particles could be as
oxide or associated with iron/manganese oxide (hydroxide) and some
mischmetal-bearing phase in tailings are RE phosphates. Considering we
didn’t find a phase contain HREEs and LREEs at the same time, there
might be exist “LRE-form” and “HRE-form” phosphates.

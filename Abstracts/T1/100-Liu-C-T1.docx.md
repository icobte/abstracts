<p style=text-align:justify>The identification and quantification of different soil organic
phosphorus (P) compounds is crucial for a better understanding of soil P
dynamics. Phytic acid (PA) accounts for 50-60% of the total organic
phosphorus in soils, thus it is especially important to accurately
determine its content using lower cost techniques. Therefore, the aim of
the study was to compare two commonly used characterization methods
<sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopy and enzymatic hydrolysis
assay. The same anion exchange resin water, 0.5 M NaHCO3, 0.1 M NaOH and
0.1 M HCl extracts of tropical wetland topsoils
was analyzed by two methods. The results showed that the phytate content
determined by <sup>31</sup>P NMR spectroscopy was higher than that determined by
enzymatic hydrolysis assay. This may be attributed to that the
extractant of the continuous extraction method also extracts organic
matter from soils. Specifically, fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA)
can be extracted by strong extractants HCl and NaOH. For the enzymatic
hydrolysis method, the effect of soil humus on phytase activity in
continuous extract solutions and pros and cons with respect to ionic
strength, cultivation time and PA:HA/FA mass ratio were examined. The
results showed that extractable soil organic matter inhibits phytase
activity, and even at low PA:HA/FA mass ratios, the activity of phytase
was reduced by 40-50% compared to the control. Both organic matter and
phytase were negatively charged, and the electrostatic repulsion between
them affects organic matter polymerization. The hydrophobic action of
humus increases with the increase of mass ratio, leading to the blocked
electrostatic repulsion between organic matter and phytase, and the
formation of polymer affects the active sites on phytase surface. The
objective of this study was to measure the inhibition of phytase
activity in extract solution and to attempt to establish a link with the
quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter.

<p style=text-align:justify>Sands are never considered a suitable host material for radioactive
waste because of their high permeabilities and low sorption potentials
implying fast transport of radionuclides (RN) such as radiocaesium
(<sup>137</sup>Cs). Belgium considers poorly indurated clays as one of the
options for geological disposal due to their low permeabilities and high
sorption potentials. The Neogene sands could become part of the natural
barrier in the Belgian radioactive waste disposal concept if a location
in poorly indurated Boom or Ypresian Clays is chosen. The sands are
characterized by glauconite contents varying from 20-80 wt%. Glauconite
is a clay mineral that is aggregated by Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, forming
green particles with average grain size of 250 µm. The objective of this
study is to determine the <sup>137</sup>Cs sorption potentials and sorption
kinetics of the Neogene glauconite sands. Glauconite
((K,Na)(Fe<sup>3+</sup>Fe<sup>2+</sup>,Al,Mg)<sub>2</sub>(Si,Al)<sub>4</sub>O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>) is described as an
iron (Fe) - potassium (K) phyllosilicate, comparable to an Fe-rich
illite with K the main interlayer cation. Due to weathering, the mineral
can evolve to a smectite-like structure with lower K content and a rim
of oxides. Leaching the interlayer cations opens the edges of the
layers, creating specific sorption sites for K<sup>+</sup>, caesium (Cs<sup>+</sup>) or
ammonium (NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>). The <sup>137</sup>Cs sorption on glauconite sands was
studied in a batch sorption test. The experiment was set up in a
background solution of 100 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.5 mM KCl with a solid liquid
ratio of 1 g to 30 ml. Initial <sup>137</sup>Cs activity in the solution was 1.5
kBq ml<sup>-1</sup>. The evolution of the activity in solution was measured at
different time intervals up to three months after initial spiking. Due
to the strong competition with K<sup>+</sup>, <sup>137</sup>Cs sorption is expressed as
the radiocesium interception potential (RIP) or the distribution
coefficient at a certain K<sup>+</sup> concentration (K<sub>D</sub>.m<sub>K</sub>). A diverse set
of glauconite sand samples was selected containing various weathering
grades and glauconite contents. To evaluate the effect of the grain size
on sorption kinetics, a set of samples was milled to an average 2 µm
size. The K<sub>D</sub>.m<sub>K</sub> values of ranged between 850 and 4900 mmol kg<sup>-1</sup> at
0.5 mM KCl after 14 days of equilibration for glauconite sands, similar
to <sup>137</sup>Cs sorption potentials in the Boom Clay. For glauconite
fractions, the sorption potentials range from 3500 to 5500 mmol kg<sup>-1</sup>,
comparable to illite references (Illite du Puy) with K<sub>D</sub>.m<sub>K</sub> of 6000 –
7000 mmol kg<sup>-1</sup>. The clay sized glauconite has larger sorption
potentials that the unmilled grains. However, no significant differences
in K<sub>D</sub>.m<sub>K</sub> were detected between large (&gt;500 µm) and small (125-32
µm) glauconite pellets. The variation in K<sub>D</sub>.m<sub>K</sub> values among the
different Neogene formations are limited, though there is a
compositional diversity and a large difference in glauconite content.
The <sup>137</sup>Cs sorption beyond &gt;3 months exceeded that of the 14 days
point, this effect was more pronounced for the pellets than for milled
grains. Taken together, this study revealed that the <sup>137</sup>Cs sorption
potential of glauconite sands are similar to that of clay deposits when
tested in batch sorption.

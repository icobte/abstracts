<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic is a ubiquitous metalloid in the biosphere and notorious for its
toxic properties. The universal toxicity of arsenic is depicted by the
presence of resistance genes in the genomes of most living things spread
across the three domains of life. Moreover, the expression of arsenic
resistance genes in primitive prokaryotes near the base of the tree of
life and in more recently evolved complex eukaryotes, suggest arsenic
toxicity ancient and that it continues to play a crucial role in the
organisation of the modern biosphere. Here, it is demonstrated that the
concentration and redox behaviour of arsenic in seawater has varied
dramatically through Earth history, controlled by climate, weathering
fluxes from the continent and atmospheric oxygen content. The data show
that it was not until 2450 million years ago that arsenate and arsenic
sulfides rose to global prominence in seawater, coincident with the
first permanent rise of oxygen in the atmosphere. It is proposed that it
was at this time that the modern arsenic cycle was first established
globally, triggering the onset of severe arsenate toxicity and
competition with phosphate for uptake into cells.

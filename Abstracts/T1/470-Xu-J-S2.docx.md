<p style=text-align:justify>A novel calcium-based magnetic biochar (Ca-MBC), made by pyrolyzing a
mixture of rice straw, iron oxide (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>) and calcium carbonate
(CaCO<sub>3</sub>), was developed for the remediation of co-pollution of arsenic
and cadmium. Characteristics of the material revealed that Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and
CaCO<sub>3</sub> were impregnated on the surface of the biochar. Batch
experiments confirmed that the Ca-MBC had a high adsorption capacity for
arsenic and cadmium in aqueous systems with maximum adsorption
capacities of 6.34 and 10.07 mg g<sup>-1</sup>, respectively, and that the
adsorption of both metals were pH-dependent from 2 to 12 with an optimal
pH of pH 5. The mechanism of co-adsorption of Cd(II) and As(III) were
both antagonistic and synergistic. A 160-day soil incubation was
conducted to further investigate the remediation efficiency of heavy
metals in soil. Following biochar application at the rates: biochar (1%,
2%, 3%) and Ca-MBC (1%, 2%, 3%), soil pH was increased and the
bioavailability of cadmium was significantly decreased. The
bioavailability of arsenic decreased, compared with the control, as the
addition of Ca-MBC increased from 1% to 3% while the biochar treatments
significantly increased arsenic bioavailability. These new results
provide valuable information for the application of Ca-MBC as a
potential material in the treatment of water or soil contaminated with
As(III) and Cd(II).

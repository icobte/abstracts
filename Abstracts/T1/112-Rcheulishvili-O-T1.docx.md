<strong>Abstract</strong>

<p style=text-align:justify>The gram positive aerobic bacteria <i>Arthrobacter globiformis</i> 151B is a
promising candidate for bioremediation of Cr(VI) and other metals ions because
it exhibits resistance against high concentrations of Cr(VI) and other metallic
ions. This bacterial species could reduce highly toxic and carcinogenic Cr(VI)
into Cr(III). In this study, we investigated tolerance and accumulation of
Cr(VI) and Zn(II) on protein level by proteomic approach. <i>Arthrobacter
    globiformis</i> 151B was grown at 3 following conditions: 1. with Cr (VI); 2. with
Zn(II); 3. without Cr(VI) and Zn(II). Bacterial cells were harvested in a time
dependent fashion (36, 60 and 120h after the starting of cultivation) and
changes in proteome expression was analyzed using two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
coupled with bioinformatics to identify proteins. Significant changes in protein
expression included both up- and downregulation of different groups of proteins.
Most remarkable changes were associated with metal-binding proteins and proteins
involved in active transport. Parallel experiments with Atomic Absorption
Spectroscopy revealed that reduced chromium appears mostly soluble and mainly
associated with organics: especially with bacterial proteins. Our results
    signify that A. <i>globiformis</i> 151 B is naturally equipped at the proteomic level
correspondingly with the relevant genes, to survive extreme toxic conditions,
thus has great potential for bioremediation.

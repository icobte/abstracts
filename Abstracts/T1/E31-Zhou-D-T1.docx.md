<p style=text-align:justify>Solid organic matter (OM) is the most abundant soil organic matter and
widely distributed. It controls the cycling of carbon and nutrients.
Here we show that solid OM reduces Ag ions to metallic silver
nanoparticles (AgNPs) under natural solar irradiation. The reduction
kinetics include a nuclei formation rate constant of 2.49×10<sup>−3</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>
and surface autocatalytic reduction rate constant at 4.47×10<sup>-2</sup> mM<sup>−1</sup>
h<sup>−1</sup>. We further demonstrate through electron spin resonance
measurements that superoxide radicals, produced from quinone-like groups
within solid OM under irradiation, are a driving force in AgNPs
formation. Our estimates indicate that solid OM contributes to about
11–31 % of AgNPs occurred naturally in soils. This provides a fresh
insight into the sources of AgNPs in terrestrial environment and
facilitates an unbiased assessment of fate and impacts of engineered
AgNPs. The reduction role of solid OM is likely widespread within
surface environment and can be expected to significantly influence the
biogeochemical cycling of Ag and other contaminants that are reactive
towards quinone-like groups.

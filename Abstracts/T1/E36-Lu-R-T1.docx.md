<p style=text-align:justify>Lead smelting may lead to increased levels of heavy metals and human
health risk. We investigated lead smelting effect on particulate matter
heavy metal accumulation in the urban area of Jiyuan City, China. Twenty
eight windowsill dust samples were collected from seven sampling areas
in urban Jiyuan; five windowsill dust samples were collected near the
Yuguang lead smelting facility to the northwest of urban Jiyuan; three
control windowsill dust samples were collected from the DWL village, not
affected by lead smelting. Soil samples were also collected where the
windowsill dust samples were collected. Sample analysis indicated that:
i) for dust samples from the Jiyuan urban area, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn mean
dust (10-45 μm) concentrations were 2540±455, 67.5±14.1, 306±11.4 and
2937±2492 mg/kg, respectively, while those of the &gt;45 μm portion were
1079±430, 52.4±18.9, 203±59 and 2421±1853 mg/kg, respectively. Jiyuan
dust Pb and Cd concentrations were 11 to 18% of samples collected near
the Yuguang, while they were 2.68 to 5.55 times greater than DWL area
concentrations; ii) the maximum Zn concentration was 22500 mg/kg,
alarmingly found in a sample collected from the People’s Hospital; iii)
the mean Jiyuan soil Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations were 270±94,
7.95±4.48, 51.6±12.0 and 270±111 mg/kg, respectively; and iv) linear
correlation between the dust and soil samples indicated that a stronger
correlation existed between Pb and Cd concentrations in the 10-45 μm
versus the &gt;45 μm portion of dusts and soil. Overall results suggest
that lead smelting activities can result in elevated particulate dust
Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn concentrations in nearby environments, with greater
metal concentrations existing in the 10-45 μm portion versus the &gt;45
μm portion. Metal bioaccessibility in the dusts should be determined to
assess environmental and human health risk.

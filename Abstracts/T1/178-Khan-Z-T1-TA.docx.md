<p style="text-align:justify">Rapid industrial development and urbanization contribute a lot to
wastewater discharge. The wastewater enters into natural aquatic
ecosystems from industrial activities and considers as one of the main
sources of water pollution. Discharge of effluents loaded with heavy
metals into the surrounding environment has become a key issue regarding
human health risk, environment, and food chain contamination. Nickel
causes fatigue, cancer, headache, heart problems, skin diseases (Nickel
Itch) and respiratory disorders. Nickel compounds such as Nickel Sulfide
and Nickel oxides in industrial environment, if inhaled have an
association with an increased risk of lung cancer. Therefore the removal
of Nickel from effluents before discharge is necessary. Removal of
Nickel by low-cost biosorbents is an efficient method. This study was
aimed to investigate the efficiency of activated carbon and <i>Pinus
roxburgii</i> saw dust for the removal of Nickel from industrial effluents
using commercial Activated Carbon and raw <i>P. roxburgii</i> saw dust. Batch
and column adsorption experiments were conducted for the removal of
Nickel. The study conducted indicates that removal of Nickel greatly
dependent on pH, contact time, Nickel concentration and adsorbent dose.
Maximum removal occurred at pH 9, contact time of 600 min and adsorbent
dose of 1 g/100 mL. The highest removal was 99.62% and 92.39% (pH
based), 99.76% and 99.9% (dose based), 99.80% and 100% (agitation time),
92% and 72.40% (Ni Conc. based) for <i>P. roxburgii</i> saw dust and
activated Carbon, respectively. Similarly, the Ni removal in column
adsorption was 99.77% and 99.99% (bed height based), 99.80% and 99.99%
(Concentration based) 99.98% and 99.81% (flow rate based) during column
studies for Nickel using <i>P. Roxburgii</i> saw dust and activated carbon,
respectively. Results were compared with Freundlich isotherm model which
showed “r<sup>2</sup>” values of 0.9424 (Activated carbon) and 0.979 <i>(P.
Roxburgii</i> Saw Dust). While Langmuir isotherm model values were 0.9285
(Activated carbon) and 0.9999 <i>(P. Roxburgii</i> Saw Dust), the
experimental results were fitted to both the models. But the results
were in close agreement with Langmuir isotherm model.

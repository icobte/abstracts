<p style=text-align:justify>High background value of heavy metals has being a confused problem for
the environmental protection departments in the process of soil
environmental quality management. Therefore, a typical high cadmium
background region has been selected as a research area. Human exposure
through soil, homegrown products, drinking water, dust will be analyzed
and calculated, which will be intergated with the body burden
indicator(urine cadmium content) and health indicators(NAG enzyme,
β2-microglobulin, retinal binding protein )，human health risk in high
soil cadmium region then was assessed scientifically. The results showed
that the mean of male urine cadmium content is 1.46 μg/gCr，and female
urine cadmium content is 2.09 μg/gCr，which showed a higher level than
American (0.32-0.40 μg/L)、Canadian (0.24-0.39 μg/L)、Korean (male 0.66
μg/L、female 0.73 μg/L)、Japanese (1.3 μg/gCr). The female has a higher
level than the male(p&lt;0.01). Chi-square test and linear card test
showed that the abnormal incidence of urinary β2-MG, urinary NAG and
urinary RBP increased with the increase of urinary Cd level, and its
sensitivity rank was urinary β2-MG&gt;urine NAG&gt;urine RBP. When the
urinary Cd level was 2&lt;UCd≤5μg/gCr, the average level of urinary
β2-MG abnormal rate was 54.5%, the average urinary NAG abnormal rate was
17.4%, and the average urinary RBP abnormal rate was 12.9%. When the
urinary Cd level was at UC&gt; 5μg/gCr, urinary β2-MG abnormal rate
averaged 72.7%, urinary NAG abnormal rate averaged 31.8%, urinary RBP
abnormal rate averaged 18.2%, indicating that environmental Cd exposure
can lead to increased Cd burdern, and with the increase of cadmium
burden, the abnormal renal function is more obvious. The index of urine
β2-MG as the environmental risk assessment of environmental Cd exposure
is the most sensitive than urinary NAG and urinary RBP, and it can
reflect the damage of renal function caused by Cd.

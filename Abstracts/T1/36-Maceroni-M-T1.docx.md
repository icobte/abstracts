<p style=text-align:justify>While the application range of SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles (SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs) is
broadening, many of the current and new uses can increase their
accumulation in the environment. First predictions for engineered
SiO<sub>2</sub>-NP concentrations in environmental surface water are 0.12 µg/L, and
the mean concentration in soil is estimated to be 0.43 µg/L. Therefore,
it is crucial to gain more information about the degradation of SiO2-NPs
in the environment, which is currently scarce. Here, we present the
results of a method development that was used to quantify the
dissolution rate of SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs in aqueous media. Silica was quantified
using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
and a colorimetric assay. After initial tests of a variety of classic
dialysis membrane systems, we adopted a membrane- free system. This
allows direct measurements of the unaltered dissolution rate. To
validate this setup, we quantified the dissolution SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs at pH 11
over 72 h in parallel with a membrane-free and a classical membrane
setup. The high pH 11 was chosen because of the known fast
base-catalyzed hydrolytic degradation of SiO<sub>2</sub> in this pH range. Using an
initial concentration of 300 mg SiO<sub>2</sub>/L, complete dissolution was
observed within the first 50 hours in the membrane-free setup. A
pseudo-first order kinetics model d (t) = dmax (1-e-kt) fitted to the
data, where d is the percentage of dissolved Si and k the dissolution
rate constant. The model allowed estimating a half-life of about 10.2
hours for SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs in Milli-Q water at pH 11. The particle dissolution
was confirmed by TEM micrographs. We currently use this system to
evaluate particle dissolution at environmentally relevant pHs. This
study shows that membrane-free dissolution systems are a versatile tool
to produce data for the fate and behaviour of SiO<sub>2</sub>-NPs in aqueous media,
which is important for the regulation of this nanomaterial.

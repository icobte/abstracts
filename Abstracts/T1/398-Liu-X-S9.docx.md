<p style="text-align:justify">Coupling sources, exposure and health risk assessment of heavy metals in
agriculture soils is critical for mitigation strategies. In this study,
an intergraded approach to link these three modules (source, exposure
and health risk) was developed, taking a former e-waste recycling region
in China as a case study. Results found that concentrations of Cd
(0.03-9.20 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and Cu (17.77-1122.87 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) in agricultural
soils were above the threshold of safe levels. Both natural and
anthrophonic sources contributed to these metal accumulations. Parent
materials and pesticide, fertilize application (F1), industrial
discharge (F2) and traffic emission (F3) account for 46.6, 22.2, and
31.2%, respectively, of the total metal accumulation. For the exposure,
the contributions of these three sources have been changed to 28.1,
19.0, and 52.9%, respectively. Despite the industrial discharge
contributes the least, it results in the most to the total cancer risks
(43.5%). It suggested that more focus on the reduction of industrial
discharge is crucial for human health, especially for these e-waste
recycling regions where suffering from industrial discharge despite it
may bring income.

<p style=text-align:justify>Jarosite is an iron-hydroxysulfate mineral commonly found in acid mine
drainage (AMD). For its strong adsorption and co-precipitation of heavy
metals, jarosite is considered a potent scavenger for the contaminant in
AMD contaminated-environment. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) play an
important role in the reductive dissolution of jarosite; however, the
mechanism involved is yet to be elucidated. In this study, an indigenous
SRB community enriched from Dabaoshan mine area was employed, and a
series of batch experiments were performed to explore the mechanism for
jarosite reduction by SRB. During which, different cultures, with and
without dissolved sulfate; physical separation jarosite from the
bacteria in culture by dialysis bag or not, were considered. Results
indicated that the reduction of jarosite by SRB was via an indirect
mechanism. In systems with
dissolved sulfate, lactate
was incompletely oxidized to acetate coupled with the reduction of
SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> to S<sup>2-</sup>, which subsequently reduce the
Fe<sup>3+</sup> bound in jarosite chemically, forming secondary minerals
including vivianite, mackinawite and pyrite. In systems without
dissolved sulfate, jarosite dissolution occurred prior to reduction, and
similar secondary minerals formed as well. The extracellular polymeric substance secreted
from SRB was demonstrated to be capable of facilitating the release of
sulfate from the jarosite mineral to the solution. Structural sulfate in
the solid phase may not be
available for SRB respiration. Direct contact between SRB and jarosite
is not necessary for mineral reduction to occur, though; wrapping
jarosite into dialysis bag suppressed the reduction to a certain extend.
Therefore, the mechanism of jarosite reduction by SRB is proposed as
three key steps: (1) the microbial reduction of dissolved SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> to
S<sup>2-</sup> by SRB; (2) the chemical reduction of jarosite by S<sup>2-</sup>; and (3)
the formation of secondary precipitation of mackinawite, pyrite or
vivianite.

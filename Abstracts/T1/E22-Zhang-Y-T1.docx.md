<p style=text-align:justify>In order to elucidate the distribution of heavy metals in soil, crop and
human body in Pb smelting impacted areas, paired soil and wheat grain
samples (<i>n</i>=40), and samples of scalp hairs of local residents (<i>n</i>=42)
were collected from villages of Qingduo(QD), Guofu(GF) and
Beishe(BS), in Jiyuan, China. The distances between these three villages
and a local large lead smelter were 1, 3 and 6 km, respectively. The
samples were analyzed for the concentrations of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn. For all the four
metals, the concentrations of soil ranked QD &gt; GF &gt; BS.
}For samples from QD, GF and BS, the mean
concentrations of Cd were 4.34, 2.11 and 0.839 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. The concentrations of heavy metal of the soil
and wheat grain collected from QD
were significantly higher than those from GF and BS (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05).
Significant linear correlation was found between whole wheat grain flour
and soil for} Cd, Pb and
Cu concentrations (<i>p</i>&lt; 0.01), however, the
concentration of Pb in wheat bran was not significantly correlated with
soil Pb concentration (<i>p</i>=0.705), indicating the importance of
absorption of Pb via the aerial part of wheat on the accumulation of Pb
in wheat bran. Significant positive linear correlation was found between Pb and Cd in the
whole wheat grain flour for all the wheat samples (<i>p</i>&lt;0.05).
Compared with the National Food Quality Standard (GB 2762-2017), 100%
and 95% of all the grains samples had Cd and Pb concentrations
higher than the respective maximum permissible
concentrations (MPCs), respectively, indicating the high risk of Cd and
Pb to local residents through food chain. The mean concentrations of Cd,
Cu, Pb and Zn in wheat bran were 7.54, 2.66, 7.17 and 2.60 times of
those of the whole wheat grain flour, respectively, indicating the more
concentrated distribution of Cd and Pb in wheat bran than Cu and Zn. The
mean concentration of Cd of scalp hair samples from QD, GF and BS were
3.31, 0.778 and 0.382 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively; those of
Pb were 132, 18.9 and 20.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively; those of Cu were 10.4,
8.79 and 8.75 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>,
respectively; those of Zn were 147, 128 and 134
mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. However, only the concentrations of Cd and Cu
in scalp hair from QD
were significantly higher than those from GF and BS (<i>p</i>&lt;
0.05). Higher concentrations of all these four metals were found in
hairs of male than those of females, with the differences of Cd and Pb
significant at 0.05 levels, indicating higher risk of Cd and Pb
accumulation in male residents, this may very likely be the results of
more frequent exposure of male residents to heavy metal-containing
particles in their career. Negative correlation was found between Zn
concentration in hair and the age of residents (<i>p</i>&lt; 0. 01),
confirming the loss of Zn in human body as ageing. The results of this
work indicate the obvious concentrated distribution of heavy metals in
the wheat bran, and the substantial contribution of atmospheric
deposition on the accumulation of Pb in wheat grains; the Cd and Cu
accumulation in human body of local residents are enhanced by the
pollution from the smelter. However, because the smelting does not
resulted in obvious accumulation of Cu in soil and wheat grains, the
accumulation of Cu in the scalp hair may be a side effect of the
interaction between different metals in human body.

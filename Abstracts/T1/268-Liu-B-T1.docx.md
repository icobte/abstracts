<p style=text-align:justify>Heavy metal (HM) pollution coupled with soil
acidification has posed an increasingly severe threat to agricultural
sustainability of tropical region in the world. However, minimal
research has been conducted on the remediation of HM contaminated soils
in this region. In this study, a vermicopomst (VC) produced from
vermicomposting cattle manure in a tropical rubber plantation was
applied to remediating a tropical acidic soil in Hainan, China. The
effectiveness of VC in reducing available HM in soils was evaluated by
incubation experiments with spiked Cd, Cr and Ni or Cd contaminated
field soil. The dynamic changes of soil physical, chemical and
biological properties after VC amendment were determined to explore the
mechanisms of HM immobilization. The results showed that VC amendment
significantly reduced 0.01M CaCl<sub>2</sub> extractable
amounts of Cd, Ni and Cr in the HM-spiked soils. CaCl<sub>2</sub> extractable Cd
was reduced by 49% when VC was amended to Cd contaminated cassava
planting soil. Thermodynamic studies showed that VC had a high
adsorption capacity for Cd, Ni and Cr, with the maximum adsorption
(obtained from the Langmuir model) of 33.45, 26.17, and 20.88 mg/g,
respectively. The reduction in CaCl<sub>2</sub> extractable HM after VC amendment
was consistent with the order of maximum adsorption for Cd, Ni, and Cr
on VC. Vermicompost amendment increased soil pH by 0.7 to 1.5 units,
which is positively related with VC rate, but negatively with the
decrease in extractable HM. These results indicates that adsorption of
HM onto VC and an increase in soil pH after VC amendment are likely
responsible for the decreased availability of Cd, Ni, and Cr in the
contaminated soil. In addition, the addition of stable organic
substances and subsequent formation of water-stable aggregates may be
also beneficial for immobilizing HM and improving tropical soil quality.

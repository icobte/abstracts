<p style=text-align:justify>Biotransformation of metals and metalloids by microorganisms is very
applicable for heavy metal pollution bioremediation in the environment.
Microbial transformations of Sb that promote precipitation and
immobilization in situ, therefore, are promising strategies for
remediation of Sb contamination. However, the knowledge of microbial Sb
mechanism is still limited. The present study isolated three strains of
Sb resistant bacterium from Sb contaminated soils, which were designated
as B1, B2 and B3. With phylogenetic identification, B1 strains was of
<i>Ochrobactrum</i>.sp, B2 and B3 were of <i>Bacillus</i>.sp. Among these three
strains, B1and B2 showed antimonite super-resistant abilityï¼Œwith both
of their MICs for antimonite being &gt; 20 mM. However, the MIC of B3
for antimonite was &lt;1 mM. Furthermore, this study found that strain
B1 could perform the antimonite detoxification through production of
Sb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> precipitation in antimonite solution. However, the antimonite
detoxification of strain B2 was not implied in the present study. To
date, the MIC of B1 for antimonite in this study was the highest among
all the previous studied Sb resistant bacterium, and the precipitation
of Sb was another important detoxification mechanism for Sb resistant
bacterium.

<p style=text-align:justify>Thallium (Tl) is a highly toxic trace element that has been applied in
industrial activities. Due to intentional or unintentional discharges of
wastewaters from the industries, Tl can be found in agriculture fields,
aquatic environments, or even in the drinking water systems. As a
result, Tl may enter the food-chain and threaten human health because of
its high toxicity. Tl(I) and Tl(III) are two major oxidation states of
Tl in the aqueous environments. The oxidation of Tl(I) to Tl(III)
followed by precipitating Tl(III) to Tl(OH)<sub>3</sub> via pH adjustment is
considered as an efficient strategy for the remediation of Tl
contaminant. Therefore, we aimed to apply the Fenton-like reaction with
the amendment of zero-valent aluminium (ZVAI) to trigger the Tl(I)
oxidation. The results showed that 0.1 mM Tl(I) could be oxidized in the
ZVAl/O<sub>2</sub> system within 360 min at pH 1.0 and 2.0. Upon Tl(I) oxidation,
the solution pH was adjusted to pH 6 to precipitate Tl simultaneously
with Al(III). The Tl-Al(III) co-precipitates were then examined using
the Tl L<sub>3</sub>-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) technique.
The results of liner combination fitting (LCF) proved Tl(I) oxidation
and confirmed that Tl(III) was the only Tl species in the
co-precipitates. Chemical analyses will be conducted to evaluate the
stoichiometric reactions of Tl and ZVAl and the removal efficiency of Tl
through the oxidation-precipitation processes.

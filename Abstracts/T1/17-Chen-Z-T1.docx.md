<p style=text-align:justify>The elements’ concentration and speciation may change dramatically along
the interfaces of difference environmental phases. However, techniques
able to track these changing element profiles both in space and over
time with appropriate resolution are rare. Here, we report a new
technique, the Integrated Porewater Injection sampler (IPI sampler),
which is designed for soil pore water sampling with minimum disturbance
to saturated soil environment. IPI sampler employs a single hollow fiber
membrane tube to passively sample porewater surrounding the tube. When
working, it can be integrated into the sample introduction system, thus
the sample preparation procedure is dramatically simplified. In this
study, IPI samplers are coupled to ICP-MS at data-only mode. The limits
of detection of IPIS-ICP-MS for Ni, As, Cd, Sb and Pb are 0.12, 0.67,
0.027, 0.029 and 0.074 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. We assembled an IPI
profiler using 3D printing to combine 25 IPI tubes in a one-dimensional
array. The sampler array is able to analyze element profiles at high
spatial resolution (~2mm) every &gt;3 hours. When deployed in
arsenic-contaminated paddy soils, it depicted the distributions and
dynamics of multiple elements at anoxic-oxic transition. The results
show IPI samlper is a powerful and robust technique in monitoring
dynamics of element profile (&gt;3 hours) in soil porewater at high
spatial resolution (mm level). The method will greatly facilitate
studies of elements behaviors in sediments of wetland, rivers, lakes and
oceans.

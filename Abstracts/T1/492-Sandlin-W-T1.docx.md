<p style=text-align:justify>The efficacy of passive treatment systems for remediation of acid rock
drainage (ARD) can be limited by the seasonal flux of discharge volume
and metal concentrations that may not have been considered during
treatment design. Drainage and metal variability can lead to surface
passivation, precipitation/clogging, and flow bypass, thereby reducing
the efficacy and life of a treatment system. Passive treatment systems
are often implemented in sites that are difficult to access, where a low
maintenance option is preferred and cost effective. Such sites tend to
be in upper watersheds that experience intense periods of precipitation
and(or) snowmelt. Current passive treatment systems commonly are
designed and constructed to an average or limited range of flow and
concentration ranges assessed from a small sampling of data; and such
systems are difficult and expensive to alter following construction. In
cases of highly variable ARD conditions, complimentary treatment systems
may assist in reducing metal content and acidity to lessen the variable
range of hydrochemical conditions for downstream primary treatment
systems. For this study, the treatment efficacy of Fe removal from
acidic solutions was compared for synthetic and natural silicate
substrates—bare silica glass fiber, functionalized silica glass fiber,
and zeolite
[(Na,K,Ca)<sub>2-3</sub>Al<sub>3</sub>(Al,Si)<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>13</sub>O<sub>36</sub>·12H<sub>2</sub>O]. Each substrate was immersed in acidic (pH 3)
solutions containing aqueous Fe(II) from the dissolution of
Fe(II)SO<sub>4</sub>·7H<sub>2</sub>O to simulate acidic, metal laden rock drainage. For
static batch sorption testing substrates were placed in nylon strainers,
suspended in acidic Fe solutions, and mixed using a shaker table while
periodically monitoring equilibrium Fe(II) concentrations. Results of
the batch sorption experiments indicate a sorption efficacy order of
zeolite &gt; functionalized silica fiber &gt; bare silica fiber.
Following batch sorption experiments, Fe(II) sorption efficacy of the
substrates were evaluated under dynamic flow conditions through the use
of a peristaltic pump to input acidic Fe(II) solution through permeable
samples of the substrates, contained in 5-cm diameter PVC pipe. Zeolite
consistently removed greater quantities of Fe(II) from solution than
other substrates and was selected for development of a new passive and
modular ARD treatment system. This new treatment system design consists
of a series of interconnected PVC pipes and removable, zeolite-filled
cartridges that can be assembled in the field. The goal of the new
system is as a complimentary system for installation upstream of a
primary treatment system to reduce the impact of variation in ARD
conditions. The modular design allows for the easy expansion of the
system through addition or refreshing of treatment cartridges to ensure
sufficient contact time for effective treatment under possible
variations in flow volume and metal concentrations.

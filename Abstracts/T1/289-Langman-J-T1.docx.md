<p style=text-align:justify>The formation and transport of biogeogenic metal nanoparticles in
mining-impacted environments is a developing concern because of their
potential for greater distribution compared to larger particles. Legacy
mine waste and metal-contaminated environments can produce soluble
metal(loid) nanoparticles whose stability and transportability is
determined by particle composition and environmental conditions. The
Coeur d’Alene River Basin of northern Idaho, USA, is impacted by legacy
mine waste—estimated 56 million tonnes of waste rock containing 800,000
tonnes of Pb and 650,000 tonnes of Zn were discharged into the Coeur
d'Alene River and its tributaries during mining of argentiferous
galena-sphalerite deposits. This legacy waste-disposal practice produced
substantial contamination of floodplain sediments throughout the basin.
For this study, monthly water samples and sediment cores were collected
along the shoreline of a metal-contaminated lateral lake of the Coeur
d’Alene River. Porewater was centrifugally extracted from an upper and
lower layer of the sediment cores to evaluate the formation and
stability of metal nanoparticles during seasonal changes from the spring
snowmelt to the return of freezing temperatures in the late fall.
Substantial concentrations of Fe, Pb, Mn, and Zn were present in 450-nm
filtered porewater during each month, but concentrations decreased
following spring runoff. Nanophase metals with an average diameter of
200 nm were present in the porewater of the upper and lower sediments
throughout the year. Nanoparticles in the lower sediment porewater were
consistently more stable (more negative ζ potential) than nanoparticles
present in the porewater of the upper sediments. These sediment
porewater differences correspond to changes in sediment S speciation as
determined by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the residual
sediments collected after centrifugation. The transport of these
porewater metal nanoparticles was detected in the lake because of a
change in the hydraulic gradient during a spring-to-summer transition
that allowed the nanoparticles to move into the overlying water column
of the lake. The presence of metal-carbonate and metal-sulfide minerals
and seasonal redox conditions in the sediments of the lateral lake allow
for production of stable and transportable metal(loid) nanoparticles
throughout the annual hydrobiochemical cycle of this metal-contaminated
environment in this northerly climate. This metal mobility because of
nanoparticle formation creates an additional transport mechanism outside
of free ion or sediment-bound metal transport.

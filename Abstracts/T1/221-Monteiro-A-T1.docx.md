<p style=text-align:justify>Available Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies have shown that feed
production significantly contributes to the environmental footprint of
edible animal products and is therefore an important element to take
into account when considering mitigation options. For this reason, the
Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) of animal feed
was approved by the EU commission in 2018. However, for feed additives
such as trace minerals, the models of their production process are still
being improved. As minerals are well known as the greatest contributors
to ecotoxicological impacts, the feed industry’s commitment to generate
data on feed additives will be important in the near future. The
objective of this study was thus to develop a high-quality dataset for
the potentiated zinc oxide source named HiZox® (Animine, France) in
compliance with PEFCR requirements. Secondly, we compared our results
with those obtained for other zinc sources: zinc sulfate and standard
zinc oxide. The PEF study was based on the method as described in the
PEFCR Feed for food-producing animals, and the experimental unit was 1
kg of zinc used in animal nutrition. The system boundaries were from
cradle-to-plant, and the environmental indicators included all PEF
impact categories, as well as the toxicity ones. The modelling was
performed in the SimaPro version 8.5 and the latest PEF datasets and the
EF method were used. The results showed an impact on freshwater
ecotoxicity of 12 CTUe per kg of zinc supplied in the diet. For resource
use, mineral and metals, the impact was 1.45E<sup>-03</sup> kg Sb-eq. For other
categories such as climate change and acidification (terrestrial and
freshwater), the impact was 4.32 kg of CO<sub>2</sub>-eq. and 0.10 mol H<sup>+</sup>-eq.,
respectively. For freshwater and terrestrial eutrophication, the impact
was 1.84E<sup>-04</sup> kg P-eq. and 7.52E<sup>-02</sup> mol N-eq., respectively. When we
compared the results obtained for the three zinc sources, zinc sulfate
presented the highest impacts for freshwater ecotoxicity (+89% on
average) in comparison with zinc oxide sources (HiZox® and standard zinc
oxide). This result could be due to the additional treatment of
zinc-containing material with sulfuric acid in its production. However,
after considering the animal production system and manure disposal in
the boundaries of the LCA study, the results could change drastically
mainly on toxicity-related categories, which strongly depend on metal
speciation. As perspective, the speciation of zinc in animal wastes
could be accounted in the LCA, providing a better assessment on the
toxicity impact of HiZox® in the receiving environment.

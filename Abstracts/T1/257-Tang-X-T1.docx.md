<p style=text-align:justify>Periphyton, composed of diatoms, green algae, bacteria, protozoa,
metazoans, epiphytes, and detritus, is widely distributed in paddy soil.
It has been studied that the periphyton could significantly affect the
behavior of heavy metals in water environment. However, the interactions
between the periphyton and arsenic in paddy soil have been reported
rarely. In this study, model paddy ecosystems with periphyton or not
were built to explore the effects of periphyton on the bioavailability
and transformation of arsenic in paddy soil. Further, the accumulation
of arsenic in each part of rice were analyzed. Results showed that the
periphyton on the surface of paddy soil could significantly increase the
pH and decrease the Eh in tillering and heading stage in soil, but
significantly decrease the pH and increase Eh in maturing stage in soil.
The arsenic content in the periphyton fluctuated from 137.9 to 272.4 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>, resulting in a significant and substantial decrease in arsenic
concentration in pore water of topsoil. Fourier transform-infrared
(FT-IR) analysis confirm that the polysaccharides, hydroxyl (-OH), and
amide (N-H) were responsible for arsenic binding in periphyton. In the
maturing stage, the periphyton could reduce the formation of iron plaque
in rice root and the content of arsenic in the iron plaque, but has no
significant effect on the accumulation of arsenic in root and shoot of
rice from tillering stage to maturing stage. The results in the present
study suggest that the periphyton mainly affects the bioavailability and
transformation of arsenic in topsoil.

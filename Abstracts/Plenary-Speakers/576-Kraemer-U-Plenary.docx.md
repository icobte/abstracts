<p style="text-align:justify">In order to fulfil their requirements of exclusively inorganic
nutrients, plants must interact tightly with their adjacent soil while
handling the challenges arising in this differently composed sphere. In
order to understand the genetic basis of plant-soil interactions in an
ecological and evolutionary context, we focus on the species
<i>Arabidopsis halleri</i>, within which exceptionally diverse adaptations to
local soil composition are known. Among the closest relatives of the
model species <i>A. thaliana</i>, <i>A. halleri</i> is a zinc (Zn) and cadmium
(Cd) hyperaccumulator, meaning that single individuals contained more
than 10,000 µg g<sup>-1</sup> Zn or more than 100 µg g<sup>-1</sup> Cd in leaf dry biomass
at their natural sites of growth in the field. Populations of <i>A.
halleri</i> are naturally found on calamine metalliferous soils containing
toxic levels of Zn, Cd and lead (Pb), but they are more widespread on
pristine non-metalliferous soils. Hyperaccumulation of Cd was observed
in a subset of populations on both types of soil, thus indicating that
the enrichment of the non-essential metal Cd in leaves can be enormously
efficient in <i>A. halleri</i>. We expect these diverse phenotypic
characteristics to be of interest for the future improvement of
phytoremediation and phytomining applications.

<p style="text-align:justify">We combine fieldwork with genetic and genomic as well as molecular
biology approaches in order to understand how diverse adaptations to
local soils function and arise in <i>A. halleri</i>, focusing here on soil Cd
levels. Cd is a comparably rare soft metal that generally lacks a
nutritional function and has very high toxicity potential in biological
organisms. Progressively enriched with successive trophic levels,
elevated environmental Cd levels are an important human health concern.
Similar to other cells, plant roots take up Cd<sup>2+</sup> cations inadvertently
through transmembrane transport proteins, for example of divalent
nutrient cations Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, and they universally possess
a molecular machinery capable of conferring low-level basal Cd
tolerance. Elevated Cd tolerance of <i>A. halleri</i> accessions originating
from geogenically or anthropogenically Cd-enriched environments indicate
that Cd can be the source of substantial selective pressure in natural
environments. We will discuss first candidate sequence variants found in
populations on extremely Cd-contaminated soil through genome-wide
association studies in <i>A. halleri</i>. These are beginning to provide
information on the targets of Cd toxicity in natural plant populations.
Finally, comparative transcriptomics of <i>A. halleri</i> populations from
contrasting environments detail plants’ needs for nutrient balancing in
Cd-rich environments. In summary, we have taken first steps towards
understanding how opposing directions of selection in differing
environments have led to a large extent of within-species phenotypic
variation in Cd handling in <i>A. halleri</i>.

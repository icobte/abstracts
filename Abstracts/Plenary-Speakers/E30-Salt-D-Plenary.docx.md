<p style="text-align:justify">Both Casparian strips and suberin lamellae, two extracellular
hydrophobic barriers located in the wall of endodermal cells of the
root, play key roles in restricting the movement of solutes and water
into the vascular system and also their back flow out. The Casparian
strip is a belt-like structure formed of lignin that surrounds
endodermal cells, running parallel to the root surface. It is tightly
adhered to the plasma membrane and bridges the extracellular space
between adjacent cells to form a tight junction between them. On the
other hand, suberin forms a waxy coatings around endodermal cells that
limits transport across the plasma membrane. Cross-talk between the
Casparian strip and suberin exists, with suberin being deposited in
response to disruption of Casparian strips. Our understanding of the
molecular machinary that builds Casparian strips, and the signalling
mechanisms that mediate cross-talk between these strips and suberin
deposition is still in its infancy. However, recent molecular genetic
and cell biological work is starting to unravel some of these mysteries.

<p style="text-align:justify">A ubiquitous contaminant of soils and sediments, arsenic arguably poses
the greatest threat to human health of any naturally occurring compound.
Nowhere is the threat more apparent than in the groundwater systems of
South and Southeast Asia. Derived from sulfide minerals within rock
outcrops and coal seams, arsenic is transferred to iron(III) oxides
(inclusive of oxyhydroxides and hydroxides) upon weathering of the
Himalayan rock strata. Transported down the large river systems during
the annual monsoonal storms, the arsenic hosting iron oxide particles
are deposited across the vast floodplains of the low-lying regions. With
continued burial, the arsenic-bearing particles progressively reside
deeper within the sediments; once the height of the water table exceeds
the particle position, anaerobic metabolic processes lead to the
reductive dissolution of the arsenic (and iron). Arsenic, upon
conversion to arsenite, is then free to move with the advecting water,
resulting in wide-spread contamination of groundwater. The rate of
arsenic release, however, varies depending largely upon the organic
carbon content and pathway of decomposition. In combination with
heterogeneous groundwater flow paths, arsenic concentrations can be
highly variable across even short distances of the aquifer. Herein, the
specific combination of hydrologic states and resulting biogeochemical
processes responsible for arsenic liberation and distribution in
groundwater are described.

<p style="text-align:justify">The groundwater threat of arsenic is clear, and mitigation or adaptation
strategies have been underway for many years. The threat posed to food
supplies, and specific rice, are, by contrast, still being revealed. We
illustrate that the combined effects of increasing temperature
(resulting from global warming) couple with arsenic have devastating
impacts on both rice yield and grain quality. Our findings show a nearly
40% reduction in yield with a 5 Â°C increase in temperature for the major
rice growing regions of the world. Further, the concentration of
inorganic arsenic within the rice grain doubles with the temperature
change. As a result of changes in plant physiology and soil
biogeochemical processes, varying soil arsenic concentrations and
elevated temperature, along with carbon dioxide, lead to a complex shift
in arsenic cycling within the rhizosphere. In combination, the impacts
of soil arsenic and climate change will lead to a devastation in food
production.

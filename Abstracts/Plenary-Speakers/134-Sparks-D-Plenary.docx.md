<p style="text-align:justify">Major environmental challenges, due to climate change, are having a
profound impact on humankind. Rising seas and temperatures are causing
increasing flooding and melting of ice and permafrost soils. The impact
of these processes on biogeochemical cycling of trace elements in soils
and water is not well understood. For example, how do rising seas, that
cause inundation of soils with saline water, followed by retrenchment,
and salinization of groundwater affect cycling of redox active elements
such as arsenic (As) and chromium (Cr), as well as other trace elements.
Under changing climatic conditions, how will sequestration of C by oxide
minerals be impacted, and resultant mobility of trace elements? This
presentation will explore these questions, and others, over a range of
spatial and temporal scales.

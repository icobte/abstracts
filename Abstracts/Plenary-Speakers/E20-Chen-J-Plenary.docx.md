<p style="text-align:justify">This is a 50 years old story telling about the studies on selenium
deficiency and Keshan Disease in China, an endemic heart disease with
high case-fatality, as an example of translational research. Extensive
cross-sectional epidemiological studies showed that low selenium
concentrations in cereal grains and low selenium status of local
residents were associated with the occurrence of Keshan disease. Several
large population-based intervention trials using oral administration of
sodium selenite tablets showed significant reduction of Keshan disease
incidence. Based on the above evidence, it was concluded that selenium
deficiency is the major cause of Keshan disease, although other
etiological factors could not be ruled out. The implications of the
findings include: provided critical scientific evidence for selenium
being an essential trace element for humans; as scientific basis for
identifying minimum requirement and RDA/RNI for selenium; and as solid
reference for the formulation of effective preventive measures for
Keshan disease in China.

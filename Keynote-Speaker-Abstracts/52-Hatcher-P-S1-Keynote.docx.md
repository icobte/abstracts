<p style=text-align:justify>Solid-state <sup>13</sup>C NMR spectra have been used extensively to examine the
transformation of plant materials in soils as they undergo humification.
Unfortunately, the spectra are viewed as non-quantitative if the cross
polarization magic angle spinning methods are used. Employing direct
polarization with magic angle spinning has been viewed as overcoming
this problem but requires exceedingly and often prohibitively long
acquisition time to obtain spectra with adequate signals. A recently
introduced technique called multi cross polarization allows for
quantitative spectra at short acquisition times has become an important
new method for analysis of whole soils directly. However, this approach
cannot mitigate the influence that Fe<sup>3+</sup> has on the signals. Fe is
ubiquitous in soils, especially in mineral soils and horizons, and binds
readily to highly hydroxylated and carboxylated humic materials. The
hypothesis we put forward is that Fe<sup>3+</sup> interferes with NMR signals and
influences trends observed during humification. Our studies show that
the humic materials produced from humification of plant biomass become
partly “NMR invisible” due mainly to their strong association with
Fe<sup>3+</sup>. Meanwhile the unaltered plant biomass, low in Fe, retains its
NMR signature and dominates the spectrum. This effect provides biased
characterization of soil organic matter, especially when it is separated
into different density fractions where the mineral- and Fe-rich
fractions typically show deviant behaviour and when it is compared with
data from a multitude of non-NMR characterization methods. When soil and
peat samples are treated to remove Fe<sup>3+</sup> prior to NMR analysis the
spectra obtained are more in line with other spectral characterizations.
It is noteworthy that for samples with almost no Fe content, similar NMR
spectra were obtained with and without the Fe removal treatment. The
disproportionate effects of Fe<sup>3+</sup> to aromatic and aliphatic components,
respectively, has contributed to a misleading understanding of soil
organic matter formation processes which needs to be re-evaluated. For
example, a recent suggestion that soil organic matter forms from
microbial and root exudates protected from degradation by mineral
associations is simply wrong because the data used to support this new
hypothesis comes mainly from NMR studies that fail to recognize the
influence of Fe.

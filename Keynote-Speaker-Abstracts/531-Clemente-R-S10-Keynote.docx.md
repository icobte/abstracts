<p style=text-align:justify>Phytoremediation of trace elements contaminated soils has faced numerous
challenges since this technology appeared as a promising option for the
reduction of soil toxicity and its associated environmental risks. The
conditioning of the soils to allow plant survival and adequate growth,
the selection of the most appropriate plant species for each particular
site and final aim (stabilization/extraction) and the management of the
biomass generated can be considered the three main issues to be
addressed for the implementation of phytoremediation. These concerns
become specially challenging when semi-arid conditions apply, as is the
case in the Region of Murcia (SE Spain). The creation of a vegetation
cover in these soils can be quite a difficult task; common impaired soil
properties and low fertility in contaminated areas are often exacerbated
in (semi)arid regions, which makes the restoration of these sites
particularly complex.

<p style=text-align:justify>Different organic and inorganic waste materials have been used for the
amelioration and conditioning of soils in phytoremediation processes.
There is a general interest in the use of waste materials (manures,
agri-food byproducts, municipal solid waste, etc.) with this aim, as
this is a sustainable way for the recycling and re-utilization of these
residues. The selection of the most adequate amendments for the
improvement of the soil conditions is crucial for the correct
development of the plants. However, changes in the properties and
chemical composition of the soil normally result in changes in the
solubility, mobility, speciation and bioavailability of some trace
elements, which may condition the success of the restoration process.
Decreased solubility/availability of the metals can be a preferred side
effect of the use of soil amendments when the goal is the immobilization
of the contaminants in the soil. The opposite effect (i.e. mobilization
or increased availability) can lead to limitations in the use of
specific materials in the presence of certain elements (e.g., As, Cd, Mn
or Zn), or to the need of using combinations of amendments to improve
the efficiency of the process.

<p style=text-align:justify>Regarding plants, the use of native or locally adapted species offers
the potential to overcome the restrictions provoked by (semi)arid
climate for their adequate growth. This, together with their tolerance
to the presence of trace elements in the soil, makes this type of plants
of special interest for the phytomanagement of trace elements
contaminated sites. Obtaining economic and ecological profits from this
biomass has received wide attention, and there is a general consensus
that this would turn the use of these technologies into reality, now
that their options for success and viability have been extensively
proved.

<p style=text-align:justify>Transformation of the plant biomass obtained in phytostabilization in a
source of renewable energy or in a stabilized material that can be
stored, transported and used as soil conditioner are the proposed ways
to make these processes cost-effective and of net interest in real
remediation approaches. This can be achieved through thermal conversion
for energy production, through anaerobic digestion for the production of
biogas or through the composting of the biomass.

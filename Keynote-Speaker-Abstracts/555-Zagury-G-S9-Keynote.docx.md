<p style="text-align:justify">Despite the broad literature available on soil contamination by
chromated copper arsenate (CCA), limited information is available on
health risks following exposure to CCA-contaminated soils. Previous
research focused on soil ingestion as the main exposure pathway but
other exposure pathways (i.e. inhalation) should be considered to assess
human health risks. It is well known that particulate matter (PM) can be
generated following wind erosion or anthropogenic activity near
contaminated soils. In the present study, ten field-collected chromated
copper arsenate (CCA)-contaminated soils and associated particulate
matter (PM) were characterized for their total metal content (As, Cr,
Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and physicochemical properties. Copper, Ni,
Pb and Zn fractionation and inhalation bioaccessibility of all metals
were assessed in PM<sub>20</sub> samples and in certified reference soil BGS 102.
In Gamble’s solution, low bioaccessibility was observed for all metals.
A strong correlation (r=0.92, p &lt; 0.005) between the soluble and
exchangeable fraction (F1) and bioaccessibility was observed for Cu.
Inhalation bioaccessibility in artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF) were
higher for Cu (avg. 78.5 ± 4.2%), Mn (avg. 56.8 ± 12.1%), Zn (avg. 54.8
± 24.5%) and As (avg. 45.4 ± 18.8%). Strong to moderate correlations
between inhalation bioaccessibility in ALF and the mobile (i.e. F1+F2)
metal fraction were observed for all tested metals (i.e. Cu (r = 0.95, p
&lt; 0.005), Ni (r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.05), Pb (r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.005) and
Zn (r = 0.98, p &lt; 0.005)). The oxidative potential (OP) of PM was
also assessed using an ascorbate (AA) depletion assay (OP<sub>AA</sub>). Mobile
Cu fractions were deemed to be the main factor influencing OP<sub>AA</sub> (F1 (r
= 0.99, p &lt; 0.005), F2 (r = 0.97, p &lt; 0.005)) in PM samples. A
strong correlation (r = 0.94, p &lt; 0.005, n=10) was also observed
between Cu bioaccessibility in GS and OP<sub>AA</sub>. This being said, obtained
results are not sufficient to conclude on an association between <i>in
vivo</i> PM-induced oxidative stress and Cu inhalation bioaccessibility.
The use of an <i>in vitro</i> cellular OP assay could help verify this
assumption.

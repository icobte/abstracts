<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic is a ubiquitous trace element and adversely affects soil biota
and human health. Microorganisms regulate the bioavailability and energy
metabolism process of arsenic in the soil ecosystem. Previous studies
indicated that the gut microbiome of soil fauna living in a key
transient anoxic micro-zone makes a significant contribution to the
metabolism and biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen in the host.
Gut microbiome is the extended genotype of the host. So far, the effect
of soil contamination on gut bacterial community and arsenic related
genes (we term this as the “gut feeling”) of soil fauna remains poorly
understood. To investigate the “gut feeling” of soil fauna to arsenic
contamination, we choose the earthworms and nematode as the model
organisms. Gut microbial community and arsenic biotransformation genes
(ABGs) were characterized by using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA and
high-throughput quantitative PCR, respectively. High Performance Liquid
Chromatography-Inductively coupled plasma -mass spectrometry was used to
analyze arsenic species. Using four earthworm species (the epigeic
<i>Eisenia Andrei</i>, anecic <i>Amynthas hupeiensis</i>, <i>Metaphire californica</i> and <i>M. vulgaris</i>) from soils with low
arsenic concentration, we found that both of low arsenic and ecological
niches caused shifts in the abundance of ABGs and the community
structure of gut microbiota. A microcosm experiment, conducted using the
model species <i>E. fetida</i> treated with different arsenic concentrations,
demonstrated that arsenic contamination exerted a significant inhibition
on the growth and survival of animals. ABGs involved in arsenic redox
and efflux were predominant, and those involved in arsenic methylation
and demethylation were very low. Moreover, exposure to arsenate (As(V))
led to a substantial alteration of gut microbial community which was
dominated by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria at the
phylum level. To further determine the influence of microbiota on
physiology of soil animals exposed to arsenic, the nematode
<i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> was fed with As(V) and three <i>Escherichia coli</i>
strains, <i>E. coli</i> AW3110 (Δ<i>arsRBC</i>), <i>E.
coli</i> BL 21</i>,</i> or <i>E. coli</i> BL 21 containing <i>arsM</i>. The results showed
that As(V) was not transformed in the gut of <i>C. elegans</i> fed on <i>E.
coli</i> AW3110 (Δ<i>arsRBC</i>), part of As(V) was reduced in the gut
containing <i>E. coli</i> BL 21, and methylated arsenic species was found in
the gut with <i>E. coli</i> BL 21 containing <i>arsM</i>. In addition, As(III) in
the gut decreased the broodsize of <i>C. elegans</i>, and methylated arsenic
in the gut of <i>C. elegans</i> alleviated the adverse impact of As(III) on
the broodsize. Vitellogenin, the precursor of egg yolk phosphoproteins,
was induced by increased As(III) concentration in the <i>C. elegans</i>,
suggesting that As(III) performed a critical impact on the reproduction
of <i>C. elegans</i>. In summary, our study reveals that the earthworm is a
reservoir of microbes with the capability of reducing As(V) and
extruding As(III) with little methylation of arsenic, and arsenic
transformation by gut microbiota in turn impacted the health of their
hosts. The “gut feeling” is carried out and regulated by its microbiota.

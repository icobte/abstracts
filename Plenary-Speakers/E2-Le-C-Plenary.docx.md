<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic is a trace element found in the earth’s crust at an average
concentration of ∼5 μg/g, which is ranked about 54<sup>th</sup> in relative
abundance. Arsenic is a component of 245 minerals, associated most
frequently with other metals, such as copper, gold, lead, and zinc, in
sulfidic ores. Many arsenic species undergo (bio)transformation, and the
toxicities of the various arsenic species vary by several orders of
magnitude. Our first objective is to determine arsenic speciation, and
we focus on the method of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
separation and simultaneous detection with both inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and electrospray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). This methodology enables identification and
quantitation of individual arsenic species present in various
environmental media.

<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic is one of the most important environmental agents causing
chronic human disease. A wide variety of adverse health effects,
including bladder, lung, and skin cancers, and many non-cancerous
effects, have been attributed to chronic exposure to arsenic. The
mechanisms of arsenic toxicity are complicated and not fully understood.
The trivalent arsenic species have high affinity with free sulfhydryl
groups in proteins. Arsenic binding to a specific site of the protein
could alter the conformation and function of the protein as well as its
recruitment of and interaction with other functional proteins. We
summarize various aspects of arsenic binding to proteins, demonstrate
analytical techniques for the characterization of arsenic binding, and
discuss the chemical basis, biological implications, and consequences of
arsenic binding to proteins.

<p style="text-align:justify">The fate and bioavailability of trace elements in the environment are
strongly influenced by their chemical speciation and interactions with
mineral(oid) particles in soils and aquatic systems. The most chemically
reactive minerals and mineraloids in the environment are in the
colloidal to nanoparticle size range, resulting in large specific
surface areas and high densities of reactive surface sites. Chemical
processes involving mineral particles include, for example,
sorption/desorption, (co)precipitation/dissolution, and electron
transfer (redox) reactions. A combination of analytical, microscopic,
and theoretical advances has led to significant progress in our
understanding of mineral surface reactions, mineral phase
transformations, incorporation of trace elements into crystal
structures, mineral − microbe and natural organic matter − mineral
interactions, and the influence of such processes on trace element
cycling. This lecture will provide an overview of the role of
mineral(oid) particles in trace element speciation and cycling in the
environment, illustrated by selected research results. Special focus
will be given to our current research on redox-driven mineral
transformations and their implications for trace element behaviour in
soils and sediments.

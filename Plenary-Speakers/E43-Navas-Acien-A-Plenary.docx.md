<p style="text-align:justify">Increasing evidence supports the role of metals/metalloids including
arsenic, cadmium, and lead as cardiovascular risk factors. Exposure to
cadmium and lead increased rapidly in most countries following the
1940s. Their half-lives, moreover, are extremely long, as they
accumulate in bone tissue for lead and in soft tissues for cadmium.
Aging populations today have thus accumulated more lead and cadmium in
the body than at any other time in history. Arsenic is found mostly in
groundwater and food, in particular rice affecting general populations
worldwide. Several systematic reviews have evaluated studies
investigating the association between lead and cadmium with incident
cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease and stroke). Bone and
blood lead, urine and blood cadmium, and water and urine arsenic are
consistently associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and/or
incidence in multiple studies after adjustment for traditional risk
factors. Observational studies are limited by confounding and selection
bias. We also considered evidence from a double blind randomized
clinical trial (Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT)) comparing the
effects of edetate disodium, a chelating agent that excretes both lead
and cadmium, to placebo in post-myocardial infarction participants
(N=1708). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality,
myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and angina
hospitalization. Participants receiving edetate disodium-based infusions
showed a reduction in the primary composite endpoint by 18% (hazard
ratio 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99, p = 0.035; number needed to treat (NNT)
to prevent 1 event over 5 years of follow-up was18). TACT2, an ongoing
NIH trial is replication trial and will also evaluate the possibility
that lead and cadmium mediate the cardiovascular benefit of edetate
disodium in post-myocardial infarction patients. The well-established
effect of metals on oxidative stress is a possible mechanisms for
metal-related cardiovascular disease. In conclusion, metals and
metalloids are possible cardiovascular risk factors. Public health and
clinical interventions are urgently needed for the prevention and
control of metal-related cardiovascular disease in general populations
around the world.

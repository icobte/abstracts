<p style="text-align:justify">Mercury (Hg) is a global pollutant, and methylmercury (MeHg) toxin is
produced predominantly by a small group of anaerobic microorganisms
possessing two key genes (<i>hgcA</i> and <i>hgcB</i>) necessary for converting
inorganic Hg to methylmercury, which bioaccumulates and biomagnifies at
high levels in the food web. However, net methylmercury production in
the environment also depends on a reverse process, namely demethylation,
catalyzed by both chemical-photochemical and biological reactions. This
presentation will provide a perspective of our current understanding of
the biochemical mechanisms of Hg methylation by microorganisms, coupled
biotic and abiotic interactions and environmental factors controlling Hg
and methylmercury transformations in natural ecosystems. I will also
discuss future research needs at further elucidating these fundamental
processes and pathways governing Hg and methylmercury transformation and
behavior, thereby facilitating targeted strategies to minimize the
adverse impacts of methylmercury in the natural environment.

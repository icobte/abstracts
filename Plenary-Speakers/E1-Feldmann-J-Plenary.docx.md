<p style="text-align:justify">The plenary lecture will highlight biogeochemistry from the prospective
of an environmental analytical chemists. It will give an introduction
that the molecular form of an element is important to understand and
describe processes involving trace elements in the environment. Aspects
of non-targeted analysis including de-novo identification and
quantification without molecular standards will be covered in contrast
for larger sample throughput analysis.

<p style="text-align:justify">Using mass balance approaches it be illustrated that often not only one
analytical technique is necessary to determine all elemental species
from one element but rather a whole range of complimentary
instrumentations. In this truly metallomics approach it is often
necessary to consider also the formation of particulate element species.
Not only is the proportion of the elemental species but rather the size
of these particles important for any prediction how the elements would
behave in the environment.

<p style="text-align:justify">Using a series of case studies it will highlight the use of a range of
analytical methods, from HPLC-ICPMS simultaneously coupled to ESI-MS,
ICP-TOF-MS, AF4-UV-MALS-ICPMS and imaging techniques such as LA-ICPMS,
XRF and techniques for stoichiometric determination of particles such as
single particle ICP-TOF-MS.

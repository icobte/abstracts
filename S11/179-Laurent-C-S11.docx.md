<p style=text-align:justify>Amendments with organic residues (OR) are a major source of copper (Cu)
contamination in agricultural soils. The chronic soil contamination with
Cu raises the problem of potential toxic effects of Cu on soil organisms
and then the long-term sustainability of OR recycling in agriculture.
Contrary to heavy soil contaminations, Cu availability in soil and
bioavailability to soil organisms remain poorly documented in the
context of long-term OR recycling where soil contamination is moderate.
The ecotoxicity of Cu depends both on its availability in soil and its
bioavailability for soil organisms. In the case of long-term OR
applications, Cu availability will be driven by the level of
contamination and by temporal evolution of key soil physical-chemical
properties such as pH and organic matter content. In the meantime Cu
ecotoxicity will depend on the bio-influence of soil organisms on the
soil volume they explore i.e. the rhizosphere for plants and the
drilosphere for earthworms.

<p style=text-align:justify>The aim of this study was to assess the effect of long-term OR
applications on Cu availability in soil and Cu bioavailability to plants
and earthworms. A hundred soil samples were selected from four decadal
field trials (chronosequences) receiving either no fertilization,
mineral fertilization, or organic fertilization and then exhibiting
contrasted soil properties. In addition to soil properties we determined
Cu availability in each soil sample following (i) a kinetic approach
based on the diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) and (ii) an
equilibrium approach based on the measurements of total Cu concentration
and Cu<sup>2+</sup> activity in soil solution. The drivers of Cu speciation in
soil solution were assessed by modelling using the windermere humic
aqueous model (WHAM). On the hundred soil samples a sub-selection of
thirty soil samples were then exposed to plants (<i>Festuca
arrundinaceae</i>) and earthworms (<i>Dichogaster saliens</i>) in biotests.
Copper availability in the rhizosphere and drilosphere was measured as
detailed above and Cu bioavailability was determined by measuring Cu
uptake flux in plants and earthworms.

<p style=text-align:justify>The soil chronosequence analyses revealed a temporal increase of pH and
dissolved organic matter (DOM) that led to an increase in Cu total
concentration and a decrease of Cu<sup>2+</sup> in soil solution, while
DGT-available Cu was not significantly altered. The action of soil
organisms, as compared to bulk soil, led to pH further increased while
DOM decreased in the rhizosphere and the drilosphere. These evolutions
of pH and DOM in the rhizosphere and the drilosphere led to a decrease
in total Cu concentration and Cu<sup>2+</sup> in soil solution compared to the
bulk soil. Copper uptake flux in plants and earthworms revealed that Cu
bioavailability to earthworms and plants were not significantly
different under long-term organic or mineral or no fertilization.

<p style=text-align:justify>All these results were consistent with the hypothesis that long-term
applications of OR, while inducing a chronical soil Cu contamination,
still have a protective effect towards Cu ecotoxicity in soil by
decreasing Cu availability in soil under physical-chemical and
biological control.

<p style=text-align:justify>Selenium is an essential trace element in life, which plays fundamental
roles on human health such as involving in anti-cancer and
anti-oxidation defense systems. The reduction of Se(VI) and Se(IV) in
microorganisms is a key process in the biogeochemical cycle, but little
is known about the molecular mechanisms of toxic Se(VI)/Se(IV) reduction
to low or nontoxic Se(0) nanoparticles (SeNPs) under aerobic conditions.
In this study, four strains of aerobic bacteria were used as the
research materials by using morphological, molecular biology, in vitro
enzymology and so on. The main results are as follows. (i) Se(VI)
reduction was catalyzed by multiple enzymes of the sulfate reducing
pathway in <i>Comamonas testosteroni</i> S44. The Se(VI) was pumped by
sulfate transporter into the cytoplasm, where Se(VI) was reduced to
Se(IV) and then to Se(0). Trace selenium was converted into organic
selenium Se(-II). (ii) It was elucidated that multiple pathways are
present for dissimilated reduction of Se(IV) in bacteria, encompassing
glutathione reduction pathway in <i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i> TS44 and
<i>Streptomyces</i> sp. ES2-5, a novel selenite reductase SerT in periplasm
of <i>C. testosteroni</i> S44, glutathione reductase GorA in strain TS44 and
a novel Cr(VI)/Se(IV) reductase CsrF in <i>Alishewanella</i> sp.WH16-1. In
conclusion, these results reveal that Se(VI)/Se(IV) are reduced both for
assimilation at trace level and detoxification under higher
concentrations in bacteria. It is also revealed that diverse mechanisms
of Se(IV) detoxification are present in bacteria, even in a strain,
including generally glutathione involved mechanism and specially enzyme
catalyzed mechanism, and different Se(IV) reductases in various
bacteria. Consequently, it is a great challenge to study biological
processes of selenium in environment by using marker genes. However, it
implies that more mechanisms of Se(IV) reduction need to be elucidated
in future.

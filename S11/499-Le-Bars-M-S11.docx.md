<p style=text-align:justify>Zinc (Zn) is the most abundant trace element in organic waste (OW).
Therefore, it is relevant to assess the environmental risk of OW
agricultural recycling regarding soil contamination by Zn. Zn speciation
in OW is a key parameter to evaluate its fate in environment and
toxicity to living organisms. We have previously shown that Zn
speciation changes radically according to the treatment applied to OW
(anaerobic digestion and composting). Nanosized zinc sulphide (nano-ZnS)
is the main Zn species in OW after anaerobic digestion, i.e. in
digestates. Whereas Zn speciation is dominated by amorphous Zn phosphate
and Zn sorbed to ferrihydrite in composts. We also showed that Zn
speciation in OW drive Zn availability in an OW-amended soil.

<p style=text-align:justify>As anaerobic digestion and composting are gaining interest in many
countries, it is crucial to:

-   assess the fate of Zn following organic waste application on soil,
    with a particular emphasis on nano-ZnS

-   determine the biogeochemical drivers that control this fate.

<p style=text-align:justify>A mechanistic approach was developed at the microcosm scale. First, we
sampled OW on a full-scale plant at four different steps of the
treatment. A clayey soil was incubated with the four OW samples having
contrasted Zn speciation (0 to 100% nano-ZnS). In a second experiment,
nano-ZnS enriched with <sup>68</sup>Zn were synthesized to discriminate Zn
released by nano-<sup>68</sup>ZnS dissolution from natural Zn in soil. Two soils
with contrasted characteristics were incubated with the nano-<sup>68</sup>ZnS:
the previous clayey soil and a sandy soil. In both experiments, Zn
availability patterns was assessed in situ and over one to three months
with the technique of the diffusive gradient in thin film (DGT).

<p style=text-align:justify>The results showed that: (i) Zn availability in the amended soil was
positively correlated with the percentage of nano-ZnS in OW, (ii) Zn
availability is controlled by soil characteristics, as significant
differences were detected for the sandy soil and the clayey soil.

<p style=text-align:justify>Therefore, Zn speciation in OW and soil characteristics must be
considered when assessing the environmental impact of agricultural
recycling regarding Zn contamination.

<p style=text-align:justify>Electronic products such as semi-conductor, computer, and mobile phone
are major high-tech industry in Taiwan. Emerging contamination elements
(ECEs) are used in these industrial processes and become potential
contaminants in soils and waters through wastewater and solid waste
disposal. In ECEs, gallium (Ga) and thallium (Tl) are essential elements
in the raw materials for making these electronic products. However, Ga
and Tl have not been paid attention yet clearly in the agro-environment
and food chain. This study investigated 296 soil horizon samples of 84
profiles from Taiwanese rural lands with different parent materials to
measure total Ga and Tl in these soils for the purposes of establishing
baseline concentrations and exploring vertical distribution of ECEs in
the soils. The experimental results show that Ga and Tl ranged in
3.12-21.4 mg/kg and 0.08-1.88 mg/kg, respectively. The mean of Ga was
7.50 mg/kg and that of Tl was 0.19 mg/kg. Ga and Tl show irregular trend
with soil depth in all profiles, and thus there was no significantly
difference in the mean values of Ga and Tl between horizons. According
to linear correlation between ECEs and soil properties, Ga significantly
and positively correlated with Tl (r=0.38, p&lt;0.01). In addition, Ga
and Tl significantly and positively correlated with free Fe oxide and
clay but negatively correlated with pH in the soils. These correlations
demonstrated that Ga and Tl co-existed and they were predominately fixed
in the clay and Fe oxide fractions in the soils. Hence, we need more
studies to evaluate their mobility and bioavailability for the
biogeochemical processes and human health assessment by using selective
extraction and bioassay in the future.

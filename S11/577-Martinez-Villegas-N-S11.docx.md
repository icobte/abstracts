<p style=text-align:justify>Irrigation of agricultural soils with arsenic
contaminated water causes arsenic soil enrichment. In the case of
permeable aerated soils, arsenic is known to accumulate on iron oxides,
causing therefore low leaching and availability. In semi-arid calcareous
environments, however, arsenic could be readily mobile and available due
to the relatively low content of iron oxides and the solubility of
calcite and gypsum. To investigate the leaching and availability of
arsenic in agricultural calcareous and gypsic soils with a history of
irrigation with arsenic-contaminated water from metallurgical
contamination, we collected samples of agricultural surface (0-30 cm)
and vertical (0-60 cm) soil to determine total arsenic concentration,
water soluble arsenic, and soil mineralogy. Surface soil samples were
collected from 0 to 30 cm, while vertical soil samples were collected
every 10 cm. We then determined the permeability of the soils by
measuring, <i>in-situ,</i> soil moisture using a soil moisture meter and soil
electrical resistivity using geophysical methods to further estimate
particle size distribution and hydraulic conductivity. Next, we
determined the availability of arsenic to maize (<i>Zea mays</i>), sunflower
(<i>Helianthus annuus</i> L.), and alfalfa (<i>Medicago sativa</i>) crops in
greenhouse experiments. We also determined bioconcentration and
translocation of arsenic within the different crops. We found arsenic
enrichment in agricultural soils up to 185 mg/kg, which is up to 5 times
higher than the background concentrations of 35 mg/kg and 8.5 times
higher than Mexican guideline for agricultural soils. Furthermore, we
found that arsenic leaches consistently along the soil profile ( 80
mgAs/kg, on average, from 0 to 60 cm) despite being only semipermeable
(from 0.002 cm/h to 1.23 cm/h). Arsenic leaching was attributed to a
high solubility of arsenic in water (10% of total arsenic, on average),
highlighting a risk for arsenic uptake which, in fact, caused high
toxicity (necrosis, reduced growth, chlorosis, or death) in sunflower,
alfalfa, and maize plants as well as high bioconcentration and
translocation. Results from study contribute to understanding leaching
and availability of arsenic in semipermeable, semi-arid environments
where knowledge is very limited.

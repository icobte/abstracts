<p style=text-align:justify>In order to explore the characteristics of heavy metal accumulation in
farmland soils in Yunnan Province. The contents of Pb、Cd、Cu and Zn in
24 counties in Yunnan Province were investigated by field survey
sampling, laboratory measurement and statistical analysis. The results
showed that the average total Pb、Cd、Cu and Zn contents of 239 soil
sampling points in this study respectively were 69.30 mg/kg、1.412
mg/kg、82.87 mg/kg and 189.11 mg/kg. And the average available contents
of Pb、Cd、Cu and Zn respectively were 23.81 mg/kg、0.572 mg/kg、3.69
mg/kg and 11.27 mg/kg. The available contents of Pb、Cd、Cu and Zn in
the soil respectively accounted for 34.35%、40.52%、4.45% and 5.96% of
the total amount. The soil organic matter content ranged from 4.22g/kg
to 76.97g/kg, the average content was 27.76g/kg. The soil pH range was
4.49~8.23, and the average value was 7.19. According to the “Soil
Environmental Quality, Soil Pollution Risk Control Standards for
Agricultural Lands”, the proportions of soil Pb、Cd、Cu and Zn exceeding
the risk screening value respectively were 9.21%、61.09%、19.25% and
15.06%. According to the correlation analysis, total Pb、Cd、Cu and Zn
in soil were significantly positive correlated with their effective
states, and the correlation coefficients respectively were
0.884<sup>**</sup>、0.832<sup>**</sup>、0.508<sup>**</sup> and 0.254<sup>**</sup>. There was a
significant negative correlation between soil total Pb, available Pb,
total Cd, available Zn and soil pH, and the correlation coefficients
were -0.174<sup>**</sup>、-0.163<sup>*</sup>、-0.204<sup>*</sup>、-0.163<sup>*</sup>. The soil total
Pb、Cd、Cu and Zn and its available state were a significant positive
correlation with soil organic matter. The correlation coefficients
respectively were
0.249<sup>**</sup>、0.212<sup>**</sup>、0.188<sup>**</sup>、0.157<sup>*</sup>、0.204<sup>**</sup>、0.214<sup>**</sup>、0.148<sup>*</sup>、0.234<sup>**</sup>.
It can be seen that soil Cd has a higher rate of exceeding the standard
and the heavy metal content of soil is closely related to soil pH and
organic matter.

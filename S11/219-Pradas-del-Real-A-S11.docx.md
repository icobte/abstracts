<p style=text-align:justify>Silver-NPs (AgNPs) are among the most prevalent metallic nanoparticles
in consumer products from which they are easily leached ending in the
sewage sludge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTP). In Europe, 60% of
sewage sludge is applied on agricultural soils as a fertilizer.

<p style=text-align:justify>The objective of the present study was to study the effect of AgNPs on
soil microbial community composition after sewage sludge application on
agricultural soils. To this end, an agricultural soil was amended with
sewage sludge containing sulfidized Ag-NPs at low and high dose (18 and
400 mg Ag kg-1 sludge, respectively), and with control sludge with no
addition of Ag-NPs (14 mg Ag kg-1 sludge). Resulting Ag content in the
amended soil were 1.8, 40 and 1.4 mg Ag kg-1 soil, respectively. The
amended soils were planted with two types of crop plants, a monocot
(wheat, <i>Triticum aestivum</i>) and a dicot (rape, <i>Brassica napus</i>). We
monitored microbial activities involved in C, N and P cycling in
unplanted soil and in the rhizosphere and we analysed the bacterial
community structure by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes in the unplanted
soil, rhizospheric soil and root compartment for the different sludge
treatments. Phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities decreased in both
low and high dose Ag treatments, these enzymes mediate in carbon and
nitrogen cycles in soils. On the other hand we saw that α-diversity was
only affected in bulk soils from high dose treatment. More differences
were found in β-diversity depending on treatment, plant species and the
compartment studied. Cannonical Redundance Analysis based on Weighted
Unifrac Distances showed that in the high dose treatment, Ag was the
major variable that shaped bacterial communities in all compartments
studied. However in the low dose treatment we found differences
depending on the plant species and the compartement. Root microbiota was
more affected than microbiota from the rhizosphere. The effect of Ag
treatments on the abundance of specific taxons will also be discussed.
Effects on microbial communities will be discussed in light of data on
Ag speciation and availability.

<p style=text-align:justify>Iron is the fourth most abundant element in Earthâ€™s crust as well as the
most prevalent redox-active metal in the biosphere. Microbially mediated
redox processes of Fe and N cycles by nitrate-reducing Fe(II) oxidizing
(NRFO) bacteria are extremely complicated. There are three different
types of NRFO bacteria according to the types of metabolism, autotrophs,
heterotrophs and mixotrophs. NRFO autotrophs do not require an organic
electron donor as a co-substrate but use CO<sub>2</sub> as a sole carbon source,
and nitrate reduction is coupled with the Fe(II) oxidation using Fe(II)
as a sole electron donor. NRFO heterotrophs need organic electron donors
to biologically reduce nitrate, but Fe(II) oxidation occurs by just
chemical processes with an intermediate of nitrate reduction (nitrite or
NO); hence, most NRFO heterotrophs are denitrifying bacteria. NRFO
mixotrophs can directly reduce nitrate in the presence of organic
electron donors via heterotrophic processes, and simultaneously, the
co-existing Fe(II) can also donate electrons to nitrate via autotrophic
processes. To understand the processes of NRFO well, model strains with
different types of metabolism were used to study the elementary
reactions and N/O isotope fractionation of nitrate and nitrite in
different conditions. Autotrophic NRFO enrichment culture KS,
heterotrophic NRFO bacteria <i>Pseudogulbenkiania sp. strain 2002</i> and
mixotrophic NRFO bacteria <i>Acidovorax</i> sp. strain BoFeN1 were used, and
a simple model was established to evaluate the relative contributions of
the involved chemical and biological reactions. The results showed no
nitrite was detected during the processes of NRFO mediated by culture
KS, and nitrate reduction and Fe(II) oxidation were mainly supported by
biological processes. For strain 2002, nitrate reduction was mediated by
biological process and Fe(II) oxidation was mediated by chemical
processes. For strain BoFeN1, the electrons used to reduce nitrate were
from both of Fe(II) and acetate, indicating that both biological and
chemical processes were involved in. The elementary reactions, N/O
isotopic fractionation and simple models would help understanding the
complicated processes of NRFO in the anoxic environments.

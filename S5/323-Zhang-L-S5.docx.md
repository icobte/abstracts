<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal for living organisms. Humans are exposed
to Cd mainly from the consumption of foods, among which vegetables are
an important dietary source. Brassicas are important vegetables, but can
also accumulate relatively high levels of Cd in the edible parts. It is
therefore important to understand the mechanisms controlling Cd
accumulation in Brassica vegetables. In a hydroponic experiment, we
found large variations in the Cd concentrations in the roots and shoots,
as well as the ratio of shoot to root Cd concentrations, among 64
cultivars of <i>Brassica rapa</i>. Because the P<sub>1B</sub>-type heavy metal ATPase
3 (HMA3) has been shown to play an important role in controlling the
root-to-shoot translocation of Cd in rice and <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i>, we
sequenced the <i>BrHMA3</i> genes in all cultivars and found nine different
alleles in the coding region, with five full-length alleles and four
truncated alleles. Cultivars with the truncated alleles had on average x
times higher Cd concentration in the shoots, and x times higher shoot to
root Cd concentration ratio, than those possessing the full-length
alleles. Heterologous expression of the nine <i>BrHMA3</i> alleles in yeast
showed Cd transport activities for the full-length alleles, but not for
the truncated alleles, suggesting that the two types of alleles
represent functional and weak or non-functional alleles, respectively.
These two types of alleles explained 87% of the variance in the
root-to-shoot Cd translocation among the 64 cultivars. We developed an
F2 segregation population from a cross between a low-Cd cultivar with a
functional allele and a high-Cd cultivar with a non-functional allele of
<i>BrHMA3</i>. The <i>BrHMA3</i> genotype explained 84.7% of the variance in the
shoot to root Cd concentration ratio among the F2 progeny.
Subcellular localization
of BrHMA3 showed that it is localized at the tonoplast. Expression of a
functional allele of <i>BrHMA3</i> in both <i>Arabidopsis thaliana</i> and rice
decreased the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd significantly. Taken
together, our results show that allelic variation in the coding region
of <i>BrHMA3</i> is a key determinant of Cd accumulation in the shoots of
<i>Brassica rapa</i>. Functional alleles of <i>BrHMA3</i> can be used to breed low
Cd cultivars.

<p style="text-align:justify">The homeostasis of micronutrients is of vital importance for all living
organisms. We recently described an emerging role for flavonoids in
metal homeostasis and tolerance in plants. Flavonoids are phenolic
compounds with antioxidant properties which play a pivotal role in human
health and diet, and are major actors during plant stress responses.
Ionomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data from <i>Arabidopsis</i> species
showing contrasting metal tolerance and accumulation highlight a new
role for flavonoids in the regulation of metal homeostasis and
adaptation to extreme metallic environments. A major role for flavonoids
during metal stresses was confirmed by using <i>A. thaliana</i> mutants
impaired in flavonoid biosynthesis and signal transduction. Moreover,
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance data also support flavonoids ability to form
a complex with metals. However, no information is available on the role
of flavonoids in the regulation of metal uptake, translocation and
accumulation in plants. Our research aims at filling this gap by
studying physiological, molecular and biochemical processes that plants
use to regulate micronutrient homeostasis. We believe that a better
understanding of flavonoids in the regulation of metal homeostasis can
contribute to the enhancement of sustainable agriculture, food security
and food quality, and to new tools in phytoremediation.

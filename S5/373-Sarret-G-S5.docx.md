<p style="text-align:justify">In several areas of the world including South America, relatively high
levels of As are found in freshwater and groundwater to a natural
enrichment of the substrate. In these areas, arsenic exposure occurs
mostly via drinking water, but As may also affect ecosystems and be
transferred through trophic chains. The purpose of this work was to
decipher the biogeochemical cycle of As in two lakes of the Andean
Altiplano with contrasted As levels: Lake Titicaca which has moderate
dissolved As level (about 10 µg L<sup>-1</sup>, close to the WHO drinking water
limit, and Lake Uru-Uru, which has elevated concentrations (about 80 µg
L<sup>-1</sup>) due to mining and smelting activities. The shore of both lakes
are colonized by aquatic plant, totoras (<i>Schoenoplectus californicus</i>),
which is used in the area as cattle fodder and in other areas in
constructed wetlands.

<p style="text-align:justify">As content in water, sediment, totora plants and periphyton (assemblage
of algae and bacteria growing on totora stems), As speciation and
localization in periphyton, and As speciation in water were determined.
Results showed very little As transfer in totora, and highly variable As
accumulation in periphyton. In one zone of Lake Titicaca, the highest
ever reported As bioaccumulation factor (up to 245,000) was evidenced,
with As present as As(V) only. In the non-accumulating periphyton found
in the other sites, As was present in the intracellular compartment as
As(III) and As(V) and in the extracellular matrix as As(V). Possible
mechanisms involved in As uptake and sequestration in the normal and in
the hyperaccumulating periphyton will be discussed.

<p style="text-align:justify">DNA analysis evidenced a few taxa possibly related to As
hyperaccumulation. Further screening on bacterial and algal isolates
would be necessary to identify the organism(s) responsible for As
hyperaccumulation.

<p style="text-align:justify">Impacts on the ecosystem and human health appeared limited, but the
discovery of As hyperaccumulation in periphyton from a water with
moderate As level opens promising perspectives for the treatment of As
contaminated water. Various technologies could take benefit of these
organisms, including constructed wetlands, rhizofiltration and
biofiltration systems.

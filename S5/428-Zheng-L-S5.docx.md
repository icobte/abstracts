<p style="text-align:justify">New developing tissues such as the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and the
axillary meristems with low transpiration require high zinc (Zn) levels
for their active growth, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the
preferential distribution of Zn to these tissues are poorly understood.
We showed here that, OsZIP4, a member of the ZIP (ZRT, IRT-like
protein), showed high expression in the basal node, tiller bud and shoot
SAM at the vegetative stage, but higher expression was also found in the
node I at the reproductive stage of rice (Oryza sativa). Immunostaining
revealed that the OsZIP4 was localized at the phloem parenchyma cells
and phloem transfer cells of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in
both basal and upper nodes. Knockout of <i>OsZIP4</i> resulted in significant
decrease in development of the tiller buds, but increase in Zn levels
were observed in the shoot basal region at tillering stage. Not only
less Zn levels in the young panicles at panicle initiation (PT) stage
but also in the flag leaf blade and in brown rice during the
reproductive growth stage in the knockout lines as compared with the
wild-type rice. A short-term experiment with the <sup>67</sup>Zn stable isotope
showed that more Zn was accumulated in the nodes, whereas less Zn in the
newly developed meristem tissues, indicating that OsZIP4 is essential
for transport and distribute Zn out of nodes to the developing tissues.
In short, OsZIP4 located in the node is responsible for unloading Zn
from the phloem of enlarged vascular bundles, which is playing an
important role in preferential distribution of zinc to the developing
tissues in rice, which is critical for their development in rice.

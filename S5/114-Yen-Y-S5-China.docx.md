<p style="text-align:justify">It is still a risk to plant crops in the croplands with a low
concentration of cadmium because of the high accumulation capacity of
some leafy vegetables. In this study, water spinach was planted in four
main soil series (Wa, Eh, Tk, and Yu) in Taiwan that were artificially
spiked with Cd. The soil available content of phosphorous was raised to
10 to 15 mg/kg and the accumulation and chemical form of Cd were
analyzed. Experiment results showed that the phosphorous addition in Wa
and Eh could promote the growth of water spinach. The accumulation and
upward translocation of Cd also increased in the treatment of phosphorus
compared to the control. The addition of phosphorus increased the
percentage Cd in F<sub>HAc</sub> which revealed that the mobility and toxicity of
Cd were reduced in the treatment of phosphorus.

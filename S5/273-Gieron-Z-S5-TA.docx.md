<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Arabidopsis arenosa</i> is the plant species closely related to widely
known model plant <i>A. thaliana</i> and the model hyperaccumulator of Cd and
Zn <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i>. <i>A. arenosa</i> occurs naturally both in diploid
and tetraploid form, in contrast to <i>A. halleri</i> in which only diploid
forms were found. The presence of diploid and tetraploid forms in <i>A.
arenosa</i> may cause that selected populations of this species are capable
of growing on heavy metal (HM) contaminated sites. Therefore, <i>A.
arenosa</i> may be considered as very interesting research object of the
mechanisms of HM accumulation and tolerance in plants. The aim of this
study was to characterized the ecophysiology of several populations of
<i>A. arenosa</i> from Central Europe. Sites with metallicolous (M) and
non-metallicolous (NM) populations of <i>A. arenosa</i> were selected in
Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Populations in Slovakia and Hungary were
selected on the basis of literature. Polish populations were selected on
the basis of a preliminary research. The ploidy of each population were
also taken into account. From each site 10 individual plants with soil
samples were collected. Then plant and soil samples were acid digested
in a microwave-assisted wet digestion system ETHOS1 (Milestone, Italy)
and metal concentration was measured using flame atomic absorption
spectrophotometer iCE 3500 FAAS (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA).
Chlorophyll, anthocyanin and flavonol content were measured <i>in situ</i> on
selected plants before their collection using Dualex Scientific+
(Force-A, France) sensor. The average annual temperature and
precipitation values for the period 1982 to 2012 were determined using
<a herf:http://www.climate-data.org)>www.climate-data.org</a>. The maximum value
of chlorophyll content was observed in plants from Vernar (NM). The
lowest value was recorded for metallicolous population from Bukowno (M).
Moreover, a comparatively high chlorophyll content in the M population
in Piekary Śląskie was also observed. The highest content of flavonols
and anthocyanins were measured for populations from Miasteczko Śląskie
(M) and Piekary Śląskie (M), which was positively correlated with the HM
contamination of soil. The lowest content of both flavonols and
anthocyanins were observed for populations from Szopienice (M) and
Tematin (NM). The PCA analyses showed that populations grouped into five
clusters: diploid populations inhabited warm sites (Hungary);
tertraploid populations characterized by the low content of flavonols
and anthocyanins; tetraploid M populations from Upper Silesia;
tetraploid populations from nonmetalicollous but contaminated with HM
sites; NM mountain populations from Slovakia. On the basis of the
results of PCA analyses it is tempting to suggest that the climatic
factors as well as ploidy level may determine the physiological status
of plants. The increase of anthocyanin content seems to be the HM stress
marker <i>in situ</i>. The increased content of flavonols may be related with
a harsh environment. At the present state of investigations the changes
in chlorophyll content seems to be not specific.

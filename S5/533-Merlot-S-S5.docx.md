<p style="text-align:justify">Despite the wide diversity observed in metal hyperaccumulator plants in
terms of species distribution and the nature of accumulated metals, most
of the molecular studies on this complex trait focus on the
hyperaccumulation of zinc and cadmium in hyperaccumulator species of the
Brassicaceae family including <i>Arabidopsis halleri</i> and <i>Noccaea
caerulescens.</i> We believe that it is now essential to obtain a broader
picture of metal hyperaccumulation in plants using recent developments
in elemental analysis and sequencing technologies.

<p style="text-align:justify">To identify new hyperaccumulator species, we initiated a screen of plant
specimens at the Herbarium of the French National Museum of Natural
History using X-ray fluorescence. Our analyses focusing on regions that
have been poorly investigated so far, including Central/South America
and Madagascar, revealed putative new hyperaccumulator of zinc and
manganese. In particular, we identified 22 species from Proteaceae,
Phyllanthaceae and Salicaceae families containing more than 10,000 ppm
manganese in leaves, thus significantly expending the number of known
manganese hyperaccumulators.

<p style="text-align:justify">To identify molecular mechanisms involved in metal hyperaccumulation in
plants, we are also developing comparative RNA-Seq based strategies to
identify genes whose expression is linked to the metal hyperaccumulation
trait in several plant families. Differential gene expression analyses
using pairs of hyperaccumulator and closely related non-accumulator
species from diverse plant families coupled to annotation of Cluster of
Orthologous Groups revealed mechanisms involved in nickel
hyperaccumulation shared by different species. These analyses revealed
that the high expression of Ferroportin/IREG transporters in leaves is a
highly convergent mechanisms involved in nickel tolerance and
hyperaccumulation. Accordingly, functional studies using transgenic <i>N.
caerulescens</i> support that the NcIREG2 transporter located on the
vacuole is implicated in nickel accumulation.

<p style="text-align:justify">A better knowledge of these peculiar species and the underlying
mechanisms will become instrumental to develop phytoextraction
technologies to limit the impact of development on the environment and
recycle valuable metals.

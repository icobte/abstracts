<p style="text-align:justify">Symbiotic nitrogen fixation (SNF) is one of the main natural pathways
for nitrogen entry in the biosphere and a likely alternative to the
overuse of polluting and expensive synthetic fertilizers. The best
characterized SNF is the one carried out between legumes and a group of
soil bacteria known as rhizobia. Through a complex process these
bacteria colonize plant cells of newly developed plant organs, the
nodules. There, rhizobia are surrounded by a plant-derived membrane in
an organelle-like structure called symbiosome, where rhizobia
differentiates into a specialized nitrogen fixing form called bacteroid.
This process requires an intense nutrient trafficking between the
symbionts, especially of transition metals (copper (Cu), iron (Fe),
manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc (Zn)) to satisfy the synthesis
of both plant and bacterial metalloenzymes. However, in spite of the
importance that metals have on SNF, it remains largely unknown how these
micronutrients are delivered to the nodule and to the symbiosome.

<p style="text-align:justify">Using synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to study Fe
distribution in the nodules of model legume <i>Medicago truncatula,</i> a
heterogeneous pattern in different developmental zones of the nodule was
observed. At the apical zone, Fe has a spotty, extracellular
distribution. In the infection zone, we observed a progressive
internalization of the metal in the infected cells, and finally their
accumulation in the bacteroids within the nitrogen-fixation zone.
Expanding on these results using μXRF and μXANES (X-ray Absorption Near
Edge Structure) on frozen hydrated samples, we have observed that the
local coordination environment of Fe and Fe oxidation state change
longitudinally too. In the apical regions Fe<sup>3+</sup> is the most abundant
species, while Fe<sup>2+</sup> is more prevalent in the fixation zone. Searching
for a more detailed Fe localization we have performed nanoXRF analysis,
and nanotomography to assess morphological changes. In future studies we
plan to use these techniques to investigate other essential elements for
root nodulation such as Cu, Zn and Mo.

<p style="text-align:justify">Altogether, these snapshots helped us to propose a model of Fe transport
in the nodule, which in the long term would support the selection of
better symbiotic partners for a sustainable agriculture, as well as
design organ-specific fortification programs mimicking mechanisms
developed in the nodule.

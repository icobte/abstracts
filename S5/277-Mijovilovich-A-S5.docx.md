<p style="text-align:justify">Many trace metal and metalloids elements are essential for life, but
excessive accumulation in food crops can have adverse health effects.
Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms of uptake and
accumulation. Knowledge of the metal distribution and metal binding to
understand the trace metal trafficking and storage, can be obtained
using X-ray fluorescence techniques. Synchrotron X-rays in tomography
and microspectroscopy provide such information on shock frozen tissues
with spatial resolution of some hundreds of nanometers to the micrometer
range. However, only very small sections of leaves and roots can be
studied. Without additional information, it remains unknown whether the
obtained results are representative of the entire leaf or only a feature
of a certain region. Due to the high counting time needed for a good
signal to noise ratio, only duplicates, and sometimes triplicates can be
studied.

<p style="text-align:justify">Using a benchtop X-ray fluorescence machine 2D raster scans of an entire
leaf or bigger sections of a root can be obtained. Furthermore, a
custom-designed measuring chamber allows for measurements of intact
leaves and roots. The combination of the two approaches (synchrotron and
benchtop) allows to quantify the variation within the same leaf, and
among a bigger set of replicates. In this study tomograms were collected
at DESY P06 using the Maia detector. The large solid angle of Maia
allows faster data collection with a relatively low dose, which
diminishes the risk of beam damage. Raster scans of the fluorescence of
whole leaves and roots sections were collected in a customized Bruker M4
TORNADO machine equipped with two large area XFLASH SSD detectors.

<p style="text-align:justify">We show two case studies. The non-accumulator <i>Noccaea ochroleucum</i> 
exposed to Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus (TYMV) was studied to understand
how the pathogen infection changes the metal distribution in these
plants. Both µXRF tomograms and XANES were measured on control and
virus-infected leaves. The XANES spectra were compared with model
solutions bearing all ligations possible for Zn speciation. XANES
revealed a different pattern for the accumulation of Zn for the virus
infected plant. In the second case we studied element distribution along
the root tips of soybean under Zn deficient and Zn excess conditions.
The roots were measured <i>in vivo</i> both with and without desorption of
elements in the apoplast.

<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium (Cd) contamination in a paddy environment can cause
phytotoxicity and elevated Cd accumulation in rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>).
Here, we explore Cd toxicity and the mechanism of Cd detoxification in
rice. We isolated a cadmium (Cd)-tolerant mutant of rice, named <i>cdt1</i>,
from an EMS-mutagenized population of an Indica rice cultivar widely
grown in China. At 2 µM Cd, the elongation of the primary roots was
inhibited by 79% in the mutant, compared with 96% in wild type. There
was no significant difference in Cd uptake between the mutant and wild
type. Using genomic resequencing and complementation, <i>OsSHM4</i> was
identified as the causal gene for the mutant phenotype, which encodes a
putative serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHM). The OsSHM4 protein was
localized to the nucleus and <i>OsSHM4</i> gene was expressed in all roots
and shoots. OsSHM4 mutation resulted in higher sulphur and selenium
accumulation in the shoots and rice grain. Under field conditions, the
brown rice of the mutant contained 83 – 92% higher Se concentration than
wild type. Transcriptomic analysis showed a significantly higher
transcript level of the high-affinity sulphate transporter gene
<i>OsSULTR1;1</i> in the mutant roots. Thiol compounds including cysteine,
glutathione and phytochelatins were significantly increased in both
roots and shoots of <i>cdt1</i>. Growth and grain biomass were not affected.
These results indicate that the nuclear localised OsSHM4 plays an
important role in regulating sulphur homeostasis. Its mutation results
in increased Cd tolerance and enrichment of selenium in the rice grain.

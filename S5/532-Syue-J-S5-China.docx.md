<p style="text-align:justify">Gallium (Ga), indium (In) and thallium (Tl) are considered the emerging
contamination elements (ECEs) because of the development of the
high-tech industries such as electronics industry and semiconductor
industry. The potential risk of Ga, In and Tl are nonessential heavy
metal that will pose environmental and biological threats. Four days
later after treatment, the shoot length of control and thallium
treatment are 13.4 cm and 7.2 cm respectively; the root length of
control and gallium treatment are 6.7 cm and 8.3 cm respectively. The
results show that there has inhibition to shoot length of rice in
thallium treatment but has promotion to root length of rice in gallium
treatment. Hence we supposed that may have an relation between ECEs
absorption and auxin distribution. The GUS staining result shows that
there has no difference on GUS staining distribution between Ga
treatment and control, however, there nearly has no GUS staining on rice
root of thallium treatment but on the tip of lateral root.

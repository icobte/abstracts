<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Pteris vittata</i>, the first arsenic hyper-accumulator identified, has
very strong ability to absorb the arsenic, so it is widely used in phytoremediation of
arsenic contaminated soil. In addition to enhanced uptake, <i>Pteris
vittata</i> also exhibit efficient arsenic translocation from roots to
fronds. Arsenate reductase PvACR2 has been identified which played an
important role in arsenate reduction process. However, the molecular
mechanism of arsenate reduction and key arsenate reductase enzyme in
fronds of <i>Pteris vittata</i> is still unclear.

<p style="text-align:justify">Currently, we cloned two HAC (High Arsenic Content) homologous genes,
PvHAC1 and PvHAC2, in <i>Pteris vittata.</i> PvHAC1 and PvHAC2 were
predominantly expressed in fronds. PvHAC1 transcripts were strongly
induced response to AsV exposure, no significant altered under AsIII
treatment. Furthermore, we heterologous expressed PvHAC1 in <i>âˆ†arsC</i> E.
coli mutant, which lacking the endogenous arsenate reductase. Under
different concentrations of arsenate stress, heterologous expressing of
PvHAC1 could complement the growth of mutants and significantly enhance
the tolerance of the transformants to arsenate. The concentration of
arsenite in the medium was also significantly higher than that of the
control. Though prokaryotic expression system, the purified HAC1 protein
has been shown to have arsenic reductase activity. PvHAC1-eGFP was
localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm.

<p style="text-align:justify">In summary, PvHAC1 is an AsV reductase that is critical for AsV
detoxification in <i>Pteris vittata</i> fronds. The functional identification
of PvHAC1 provided an insight into enhancing plant arsenic tolerance and
decreasing arsenic accumulation by genetic engineering in future.

<p style=text-align:justify>The gram positive aerobic bacteria <i>Arthrobacter globiformis</i> 151B is a
promising candidate for bioremediation of Cr(VI) and other metals ions
because it exhibits resistance against high concentrations of Cr(VI) and
other metallic ions. This bacterial species could reduce highly toxic
and carcinogenic Cr(VI) into Cr(III). In this study, we investigated
tolerance and accumulation of Cr(VI) and Zn(II) on protein level by
proteomic approach. <i>Arthrobacter globiformis</i> 151B was grown at 3
following conditions: 1. with Cr (VI); 2. with Zn(II); 3. without Cr(VI)
and Zn(II). Bacterial cells were harvested in a time dependent fashion
(36, 60 and 120h after the starting of cultivation) and changes in
proteome expression was analyzed using two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry
(LC-MS/MS) coupled with bioinformatics to identify proteins. Significant
changes in protein expression included both up- and downregulation of
different groups of proteins. Most remarkable changes were associated
with metal-binding proteins and proteins involved in active transport.
Parallel experiments with Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy revealed that
reduced chromium appears mostly soluble and mainly associated with
organics: especially with bacterial proteins. Our results signify that
A. <i>globiformis</i> 151 B is naturally equipped at the proteomic level
correspondingly with the relevant genes, to survive extreme toxic
conditions, thus has great potential for bioremediation.

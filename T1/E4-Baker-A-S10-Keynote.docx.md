<p style=text-align:justify>Serpentine (ultramafic) outcrops in Europe cover &gt; 10,000 km<sup>2</sup> and
have a low fertility and low productivity, making them unattractive for
traditional agriculture. These areas are generally slowly being
abandoned by local farmers, affected by strong rural exodus and
landscapes undergo a process of closure. However, ultramafic landscapes
have the potential to provide multiple ecosystem services that can
contribute to Europe’s goals towards ensuring food security, production
of renewable raw materials and renewable energy. Agromining aims at
cultivating metal hyperaccumulator plants that are able to accumulate
nickel and other strategic elements from metal-enriched soils and
transport them to the shoots (&gt; 1%), which can then be harvested as a
bio-ore. Such metal-rich biomass can be used to recover highly valuable
metals such as nickel, and also to produce energy (heat, electricity)
and hence the circular economy. Nickel agromining can thus offer an
eco-efficient alternative to classical pyro- or hydrometallurgical
processes without disturbing the soil cover and the geology from soils
and rocks that would be considered as low-grade ores or sterile material
unsuitable for conventional mining methods. Phytomining agro-ecosystems
can lead to better soil resource efficiency and can offer a fully
integrated, new agromining agriculture that could cover thousands of km2
in Europe, benefit local communities with a sustainable rural
development and provide a wide array of ecosystem services which will
need to be optimized under a life cycle assessment methodology: (1)
Production of bio-sourced metal products; (2) Production of energy
biomass; (3) Restoration of soil fertility for conventional agriculture
(Ni stress); (4) Limiting Ni intake by local populations and farmers;
(5) Use and conservation of local biodiversity (plant and soil fauna and
microflora) as cultivated ecosystems; (6) Storage of carbon in
cultivated soils and (7) Enhancement of pollination activity at
landscape level. In SE Asia, there are also vast areas of ultramafic
(lateritic) soils where agromining can be applied. These include both
forested and cleared areas uneconomic for traditional mineral
exploitation, as in Malaysia, Indonesia and New Caledonia. Work is
currently underway in Sabah to restore some value to land abandoned
after failed oil palm crops. Agromining can also be integrated into the
planning of progressive mineral exploration and post-mining restoration
for new mineral concessions. Nickel agromining may therefore be helpful
in changing the economical balance in historically-disadvantaged
ultramafic regions of the world.

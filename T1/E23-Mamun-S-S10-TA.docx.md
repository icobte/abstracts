<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd), a non essential trace element, is found in elevated
concentrations in soils due to Cd containing phosphate fertilizer
application and industrial waste discharge. In Bangladesh, the daily
intake of Cd exceeds the guideline values as the market rice and
vegetables were reported containing high concentration of Cd. We aimed
to find out the concentration of Cd in soils of Bangladesh and the
effect of different rates of compost, phosphate fertilizer and their
combinations on the transfer of Cd from soil to kalmi (<i>Ipomoea
aquatica</i>) and red amaranthus (<i>Amaranthus cruentus</i>) and the growth of
the plants in pot trial. We selected 330 locations from 3 disdtricts of
Bangladesh and collected top soil (0-15.0) cm and sub soil (15.0-30.0
cm) samples from each point. The soil Cd concentrations ranged from 0.97
mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg in top soil (0-15 cm) and 0.96 mg/kg to 3.6 mg/kg in
sub soil (15-30 cm). We used soils in the pot trial that had Cd
concentration of 1.2 ppm which were collected from an agricultural land.
In pot trial, the treatments were control, compost 1 t/ha, compost 5
t/ha, compost 10 t/ha, TSP 40 kg/ha, TSP 60 kg/ha, TSP 80 kg/ha, compost
1t/ha + TSP 40 kg/ha, compost 5t/ha + TSP 40 kg/ha, compost 10t/ha + TSP
40 kg/ha, compost 1t/ha + TSP 60 kg/ha, compost 5t/ha + TSP 60 kg/ha,
compost 10t/ha + TSP 60 kg/ha, compost 1t/ha + TSP 80 kg/ha, compost
5t/ha + TSP 80 kg/ha and compost 10t/ha + TSP 80 kg/ha. After bringing
the soils from 0-30 cm depth, the soils were mixed throughly, put in to
4 kg plastic pots, treatments (d.w.) were added (w/w), mixed properly
and 500 ml water/pot was added daily for 15 days. Then the seeds of
kalmi (<i>Ipomoea aquatica</i>) and red amaranthus (<i>Amaranthus cruentus</i>)
were sown. After germination the plants were kept in a net house
following a randomised block design and allowed to grow for four (4)
weeks. There were 3 replications for each treatment. After harvesting
the plants, the fresh weight was recorded. Then the plants were dried (
dry weight was recorded), ground and analysed. The highest Cd
concentration in kalmi (<i>Ipomoea aquatica</i>) (1.8 mg/kg d.w.) and red
amaranthus (<i>Amaranthus cruentus</i>) (2.1 mg/kg d.w.) was observed when
the plants were grown in compost 10 t/ha treated soils. Compost 10 t/ha
wheather alone or with fertilizer treatments increased the Cd
concentration in plants (up to 30%) compared to control while the 1 and
5 ton compost/ha either reduced or not affected the Cd concentration in
plants. The 10 t/ha compost application also reduced the pH of soils.
Compost 10 t/ha application reduced the growth of plants wheras the
other compost treatments alone or with fertilizers either increased the
growth of plants or did not change the growth. Lime with compost higher
than 10 ton/ha together with reduced phosphate fertilizer rates could be
tried to reduce the input of Cd containing TSP in agricultural soils
while maintaining the growth of plants.

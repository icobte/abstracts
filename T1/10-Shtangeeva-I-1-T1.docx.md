<p style=text-align:justify>Native populations of plants include different plant species that differ
at physiological, biochemical, and genetic levels. We may assume that
these specific features partially result from quantitative distributions
of different macro- and trace elements in the plants. During recent
years an impressive progress has been made in the understanding of the
processes of uptake and pathways of various chemical elements in plants.
It was shown that different genotypes may differ in the demands for
mineral element supply and capacity of the element uptake, transport and
involvement in the plant metabolism. Differences in the plant mineral
nutrition have been recognized by both agronomists and molecular
biologists. It has been assumed that each plant species has developed a
specific element composition, and concentrations of different elements
in a plant reflect first of all plant nutrient requirements rather than
concentrations of the nutrients in soil. Different plants growing in the
same place often have different concentrations of trace and
macro-elements. It is important to remember that under ordinary
conditions, each plant part may have its own characteristic
concentrations of elements. Therefore, comparisons of element
concentrations in plants may not be referred to the plant as a whole but
should refer to the same plant parts (e.g. roots, or leaves, or seeds).
Lastly, we may assume that not only concentration of one or another
element in a particular plant part of any two plant species growing in
the same environment may differ significantly but relations between
elements in the plants may also be different. In the present work we
compare different plant species grown both in a field and in greenhouse.
The basic idea is that not only concentrations of organic compounds but
also concentrations of macro- and trace elements in the plant species,
and probably relationships between elements in different parts of the
plants, may be different. The aim is to assess and to try to explain the
differences and similarities in the ability of the plants to uptake and
translocate different elements. We also studied relationships between
various elements in different parts of the plant species, stressing the
importance of not only organic but also mineral components as an
additional indicator of the plant classification.

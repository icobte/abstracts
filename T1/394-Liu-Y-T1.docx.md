<p style=text-align:justify>Hydroquinone (H<sub>2</sub>Q) and chromium (Cr) are commonly used in
semiconductor manufacturing processes, tanning, paint, etc., and they
are the major environmental pollutants in industrial wastewaters.
Hydroquinone was also found as the intermediate product in
phenol-containing wastewaters. Chromium(VI) is a toxic and carcinogenic
substance with high mobility, and it will cause mutagenic effects to
organisms. Therefore, Cr(VI) reduction by organic compounds is one of
the major pathways to alleviate the toxicity and mobility of Cr(VI) in
the wastewaters. However, the oxidative products of organic compounds
receive less scientific attentions. In this study, H<sub>2</sub>Q was used as a
representative of the organic compound to determine the redox
interactions with Cr(VI) in the dark and the concomitant oxidative
products. Results showed that while 3.5 mg L<sup>-1</sup> Cr(VI) reacted with 20
mg L<sup>-1</sup> H<sub>2</sub>Q, 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ) was the only organic product. In
the high concentration system with 400-1600 mg L<sup>-1</sup> of H<sub>2</sub>Q and 105 mg
L<sup>-1</sup> of Cr(VI), spectroscopic analyses indicated that an oxidative
polymerization of organic molecules occurred accompanied with the
productions of Cr(III)-enriched organic polymers. The BQ was probably
the primary intermediate of H<sub>2</sub>Q that induced the subsequent oxidative
polymerization in the presence of Cr(VI). The linear combination fitting
(LCF) for Cr K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra
demonstrated that the organic polymers consisted of 78.0-90.4%
Cr(III)-humic-like polymers, suggesting that Cr(III) may act as a
linkage of the organic molecules during the polymerization processes of
H<sub>2</sub>Q.

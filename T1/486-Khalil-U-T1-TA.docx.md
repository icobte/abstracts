<p style="text-align:justify">Chromium (Cr) is considered as one of the 14 most toxic heavy
metal(loid)s worldwide. In this experiment, the potential of tea waste
was investigated in batch sorption experiments for the removal of Cr(VI)
from aqueous solutions under various experimental conditions. The
results depicted that the maximum Cr(VI) sorption was achieved at pH 5.2
which was 99.2%. The biosorbent dose of 0.6 g L⁻¹ and 2-h contact time
were sufficient to achieve successful removal of Cr(VI) from water.
Sorption isotherm data revealed that Langmuir isotherm model fitted well
with the experimental data which suggested that Cr(VI) sorption was
dominated by chemisorption process. Kinetic modeling was also applied on
kinetic experimental data and results described that pseudo-second-order
model has given the best fit to the kinetic data over the
pseudo-first-order model. The sorption process was significantly
impacted by the presence of co-occurring anions including sulfate,
phosphate, and nitrate; however, during the presence of sulfate,
sorption of Cr(VI) was highly reduced (about 64.70%) compared to other
anions. It could be concluded that tea waste is a low-cost and potential
biowaste to remove Cr(VI) from wastewater.

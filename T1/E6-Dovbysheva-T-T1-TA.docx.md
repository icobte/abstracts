<p style="text-align:justify">The catastrophe on Chernobyl nuclear-power station was the cause of
pollution of terrain of Belarus by technogenic radionuclides. The big
danger to alive organisms now represents Sr–90 and Cs-137 with a
half-life of 28.5 and 30 years accordingly. At present practically all
radionuclides are in the upper layer of the soil and are accessible to
plants on meadow land and an arable land owing to small speed of
migration of radionuclides in the depth of a profile of the soil. On the
majority of not processed of species of the soils sod-podzolic wetland
are of 80… 90 % radionuclides in a 5-centimetric layer. The erect
migration of cesium-137 and strontium - 90 on depth of an edaphic
profile on not processed land is proceeded with small speed. The layer
of the soil is deeper than 25 sm is characterized by a background level
of a radio-activity. On the arable soils the radionuclides are
distributed rather in regular intervals on all depth of a processed
layer (0 - 30 sm).

<p style="text-align:justify">The results of researches is shown, that the basic sorbents of
radionuclides are:

-   organic substances of soils (humic and phulvo -acids)

-   colloidal part of physical clay

<p style="text-align:justify">Absorbed radionuclides strongly kept by soil particles therefore their
migration from the superficial polluted layer of soil in deeper horizons
is extremely limited. Even in the conditions of washing of superficially
polluted soils by rains and waters from thawed snow within several years
there is no appreciable moving of radioactive pollution in a soil
profile. The great bulk (mass) of radionuclides on virgin soil and on
not processed soils remains in the upper layer of soil of 2-5 sm. As a
rule, horizontal migration of the radionuclides on the soil surface,
caused by soil blowing or carrying over of the polluted soil particles
by surface water stream is insignificant. The Migration of radionuclides
on a soil profile, their biological availability to plants is
appreciably defined by processes of their interaction with soil. To the
soil characteristics influencing behaviour of radionuclides in soil and
in system soil - a plant, concern:

>  Acidity,
>
>  Base exchange capacity,
>
>  compound of exchange cations,
>
>  content of a humus,
>
>  mineralogical compound.

<p style="text-align:justify">At the same time processes of local secondary pollution are observed on
account of horizontal migration of radionuclides owing to the wind and
water erosion of the soils.

<p style="text-align:justify">The content of radionuclides in the plants depends on variety of
factors. The fundamental are:

<p style="text-align:justify">1. The concentration and forms of a finding of radionuclides in a layer
of soil.

<p style="text-align:justify">2. Geochemical features of radionuclides and presence of relatives of
chemical elements

<p style="text-align:justify">3. Specific features of plants.

<p style="text-align:justify">As a result of studying of circulation of radionuclides in
nature-vegetative complexes it is possible to make the scheme of
distribution of radionuclides between biogeocenosis ingredients. Soil
solution destruction hot particles sorption a desorption.

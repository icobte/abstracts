<p style=text-align:justify>Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) landﬁlls contain a variety of toxic
xenobiotic compounds, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
Biochar (BC) derived from pyrolysis of biomass are increasingly being
recognized as a sorbent for organic contaminants. The objectives of this
study were to produce MSW BC form an organic fraction of solid waste and
evaluate its potential for remediation of VOCs from landfill leachate
while the reduction of MSW by utilizing as a sustainable option for
solid waste management. The MSW was transformed into MSW BC by on-site
pyrolyzer built at the Open dumpsite. The produced MSW BC was
characterized for proximate, ultimate, and elemental analysis. For
adsorption potential determination, batch sorption studies were
conducted for ethylbenzene, toluene under single and binary aqueous
media as a sorbate with MSW BC. Edge sorption was conducted for
different pH (3,5,7, and 9) levels and kinetics were conducted for 50
µg/L sorbate for different time (½ - 24 h) intervals. Batch equilibrium
isotherm studies conducted in different temperatures (25, 35, 45 °C) and
range of concentration (10 – 600 µg/L) while, concentration acquired
under the static headspace GCMS facility. The amounts of total sorbate
ware being doubled for binary setup. The nonlinear curve fittings
employed for isotherm and kinetics to obtain the mechanistic role of
sorbent sorbate interaction. According to the proximate and ultimate
results high temperature derived and lower polarity index [(O+N)/C]
(0.26) exhibited highly carbonized structure indicated and it can
influence the hydrophobicity and favorability of organic sorption.
Furthermore, elemental results of the MSW BC presented are very low and
tracer bioavailability of trace metals implies the sorbent suitability.
Removal of both sorbate was increased with the pH and maximum observed
at 9. Maximum adsorption capacities for ethylbenzene and toluene were in
the single sorbate system respectively 476, 486 µg/g express under room
temperature the maximum adsorption capacity of binary system was 514,
492 µg/g for the same sorbates. The entire systems depict the
favorability of adsorption while increasing temperature. However, binary
system demonstrate mutually exclusive sorption, and elevated
ethylbenzene maximum sorption in all temperatures could explain
hydrophobicity of sorbent favor and competitive for higher adsorption.
Best fitting of both Freundlich and Langmuir reveal simultaneous
influence of the chemisorptive and physisorptive behavior of sorbates
sorbent interaction. Thus kinetic fittings more narrate towards
chemisorption process in single and binary system. Thermodynamics
results imply low and explain the nature of the physical interaction of
all systems. This study suggests the potential of MSW BC for complex
matrix of VOCs adsorption from landfill leachate and biochar as a
sustainable option of simultaneous waste management and pollution
control.

<p style=text-align:justify>Jarosite [KFe<sub>3</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>6</sub>] occurs
commonly in the oxidised portions of sulphide ore deposits, fluvial
environments contaminated by acid rock or acid mine drainage (ARD, AMD),
wastes produced from the metallurgical extractive industry, acid
sulphate soils and clay seams and beds, and readily breaks down when
removed from its stability region by presumably converting to iron(III)
oxide or oxyhydroxide phases. When subjected to reducing conditions,
these conditions can trigger the Fe<sup>2+</sup>-induced transformation of
jarosite to more stable Fe(III) minerals, such as goethite with a rise
in pH . There are many reduced organic matters in the wild which are
able to reduce Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides to aqueous
Fe(II). Because of the influence of organic matter，original reactant or
the final product，in the system，the secondary Fe phases of
Fe<sup>2+</sup>-induced transformation of jarosite may be difference comparing to
adding aqueous Fe(II) directly. Also previous studies of the interaction
of reduced organic matters with iron oxide have largely focused on the
reactivity of the iron
oxide, with kinetic equations used to describe the reductive dissolution
process, there is little focuse on the transformation of minerals. Here
we investigate the transformation of jarosite in the presence of
cysteine to examine the impact of the naturally occurring reducing agent
on such an Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of jarosite. The
transformation of jarosite to possible secondary Fe(III) mineralization
products was identified using XRD, SEM, FTIR and TEM. Previous studies
showed that the Fe(II) adding directly has resulted in transformation of
jarosite to lepidocrocite and goethite via an intermediate green rust
(GR-SO4) phase , but only lepidocrocite was found in this study. Further
experiments indicated that this was possible due to the presence of
cysteine disturbed the rate and amount of Fe(II) transport to the oxide
surface, including formation of Ferrous-Cysteinate complexes and
adsorption of cysteine，inhibiting the formation of goethite. These
results have implications for further study of environmental mobility
and bioavailability of incorporated metal(loid)s.

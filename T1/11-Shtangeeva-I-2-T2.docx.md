<p style=text-align:justify>Bromine is the 44<sup>th</sup> most common element in the Earth's crust. Bromides
are commonly found in the environment along with sodium chloride, owing
to their similar physical and chemical properties, but in smaller
quantities. Bromine compounds were extensively produced and used for
various aims over a long time. Meanwhile, it was shown that Br compounds
are persistent in the environment, accumulate in the food chain and are
of toxicological concern. The application of Br-containing chemicals
resulted in increase of Br concentration in soil. Plants growing in the
soil demonstrated considerable increase of Br uptake. Bromine is a new
essential trace element for humans and animals. Although various plant
species are capable of accumulating high concentrations of Br, its role
in plants has not been identified yet. We can only state that Br is a
constituent of all plant tissues. However, there is no real evidence to
support the view that Br is concerned with any function in a plant.
Thus, the question why plants have evolved the accumulation mechanism
for Br as well as Br requirements of different plant
species and its toxicity should be considered.

<p style=text-align:justify>The aims of the research were (1) to assess the response of several
plant species to the increase of Br concentration in soil and (2) to
study the factors responsible for uptake and accumulation of Br in the
plants grown in the soil enriched with different bromides. The plants
were exposed to three bromides: KBr, NH<sub>4</sub>Br, and NdBr<sub>3</sub><sup>.</sup>6H<sub>2</sub>O. The
purpose was to estimate effects of both Br<strong><sup>-</sup></strong> (as anion) and other
components (cations) of the compounds on the plant development and
nutrition. The challenge was to test can the cations additionally
influence on the distribution of Br in the plants. The most negative
effect on the leaf biomass was observed as a result of growth of the
plants in soil spiked with NdBr<sub>3</sub><sup>.</sup>6H<sub>2</sub>O. One might suggest that this
was due to an increase of both Br and Nd concentrations in the plants.
However, when the plants were grown in the soil spiked with
NdBr<sub>3</sub><sup>.</sup>6H<sub>2</sub>O, only roots of all the plants accumulated high
concentrations of Nd. Thus, roots served as a natural barrier preventing
transfer of Nd to leaves. It may be assumed that the combined exposure
to Br and Nd was toxic for these plant species. The plants grown in the
soil spiked with bromides were capable of accumulating high
concentrations of The rate of Br accumulation, however, depended on the
plant species. The highest concentration of Br was found in oat, and the
least Br accumulation was observed in pea. The accumulation of Br also
depended on bromide compounds presented in soil. All the plants
accumulated more Br when they were grown in the KBr-spiked soil. Less Br
was found in the plants grown in the soil spiked with NH<sub>4</sub>Br. The
lowest Br concentrations were observed in the plants grown in the soil
spiked with NdBr<sub>3</sub><sup>.</sup>6H<sub>2</sub>O. Probably, the Nd bioaccumulation could
prevent partly the uptake of In response to the Br bioaccumulation
concentrations of several key elements required for the plant growth (K,
Na, Ca, Mg, Zn, and Cl) decreased.

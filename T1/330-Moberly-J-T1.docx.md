<p style=text-align:justify>Coeur d’Alene Lake (CDAL) is heavily contaminated with toxic metals,
such as As, Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, Pb, and Zn, from legacy mining practices.
Differences in mineral phase association and the role of diagenesis have
led to uncertainty regarding metal fate and transport, especially if
CDAL transitions from its mesotrophic status to a eutrophic state. While
Zn inhibition of phytoplankton is believed to reduce the probability of
an algae-induced eutrophic event, alterations in lakewater chemistry,
increased water temperature with climate change, or reduction in the
input of Zn from planned remediation could result in increased
bioproductivity. An increase in algae production may induce algal blooms
and the potential for additional metal release from contaminated
sediments to the water column. The primary objective of this study was
to assess the effect of anaerobic conditions (control) and addition of
algal biomass (treatment) in sediment porewater and dissolved metal flux
across the sediment-water interface (SWI). This experiment was conducted
as a benchtop examination of metal mobility using cores collected from
the CDAL lake bottom, which were incubated for eight weeks at 5ºC under
a N<sub>2</sub> atmosphere with an overlying water column. Selected control and
treatment cores were sacrificially sampled every two weeks for analysis
of metals, anions, pH, and ORP of porewater/overlying water and metal
concentrations of separated sediments. In control and treatment cores,
all metals (As, Cu, Cd, Fe, Mn, Zn), except Pb, were released into the
SWI and overlying water over the course of the experiment. Treatment
significantly increased the rate of release for As, Mn, Fe, and Cu
(p&lt;0.05), but not Zn and Cd. Although, there was a significant
interaction between treatment and time for As and Fe (p &lt;0.05). Flux
ratios (treatment/control) for As (10.4 ± 0.7), Cd (1.7 ± 0.2), Cu (1.8
± 0.3), Fe (252.0 ± 142.6), Mn (3.1 ± 0.2), Pb (4.1 ± 2.4), and Zn (0.7
± 0.7) demonstrate that treatment had a substantial impact on the
release and mobility of most metals. Metal concentrations in porewater
below 3 cm did not appear to be influenced by treatment as indicated by
a fluoride tracer that suggested limited permeability and diffusion of
metals from lower layers. Results of the study indicate that eutrophic
conditions would induce further metal mobility and decrease water
quality in CDAL, especially for redox active metals, such as As, Mn, and
Fe. Future remediation activities to decrease Zn input to CDAL will need
to consider the potential impact of increased phytoplankton production
on metal release from the sediments to minimize negative impacts
associated with possible eutrophication of CDAL.

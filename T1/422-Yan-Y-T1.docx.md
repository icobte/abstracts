<p style=text-align:justify>Largely used rare earth elements (REEs) have the possibility to emit
into the atmosphere and could be used as source tracers of both
long-range and point source emissions. However, as extensive materials
for optoelectronic industries, the environment effects of optoelectronic
production on the presence of REEs in dust have seldom been reported. In
this study, we investigated the provenance of REEs in dust samples
collected from different functional areas of a coastal city in Southeast
China, where there are many optoelectronic enterprises. Our results
showed that the concentrations of Eu, Tb, and Y were specifically
elevated in the dust samples near an optoelectronic company which uses
REEs for LED production. In addition, the chondrite-normalized REE
patterns, characteristic parameters of REEs and ternary La-V-Eu, La-V-Tb
and La-V-Y plots demonstrated that Eu, Tb, and Y used in the
optoelectronic production processes could not only be released to the
atmosphere but also increased their concentrations in the dusts
collected from the surrounding regions. Except for Eu, Tb, and Y,
sources of the other REEs were further identified by a combination of
<sup>143</sup>Nd/<sup>144</sup>Nd and LREE/HREE ratios. Our results not only provide more
information about the influence of optoelectronic applications on Eu,
Tb, and Y, but also corroborate the effects of both natural (local soil)
and anthropogenic effects on REEs in urban dust.

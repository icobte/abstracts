<p style="text-align:justify">Accidental ingestion of contaminated soil has been recognized as an
important pathway of human exposure to lead (Pb), especially for
children through hand-to-mouth activities. Intake of food following the
soil ingestion may affect the bioaccessibility of Pb in the
gastrointestinal tract. In this study, the effect of steamed bread and
spinach on the transformation and subsequent bioaccessibility of Pb in
two soils was determined by the physiologically based extraction test
(PBET).

<p style="text-align:justify">The bread increased the bioaccessibility of Pb in PbCO<sub>3</sub>-contaminated
soil in the intestinal phase, but the decreased bioaccessibility of Pb
was observed in the gastric phase after the steamed bread was added. The
decrease was attributed to the formation of Pb phosphate precipitates
However, in the soil contaminated with free Pb<sup>2+</sup> or sorbed Pb forms,
the steamed bread increased the Pb bioaccessibility in both gastric and
intestinal phases. This was probably due to the higher dissolved organic
carbon induced transformation of Fe/Mn oxides-sorbed Pb into soluble
Pb-organic complex. Addition of spinach into the two soils reduced the
Pb bioaccessibility in both gastic and intestinal phases. This was
probably due to the fiber-induced transformation of soluble Pb-organic
complex and free Pb<sup>2+</sup> into less soluble sorbed Pb.

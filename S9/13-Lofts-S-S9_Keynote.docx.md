<p style="text-align:justify">It is a well-attested fact that the uptake and toxicity of cationic
metals to organisms are dependent on the chemistry of the exposure
medium. Considerable research effort has been devoted to development of
modelling tools to understand, explain and predict these medium effects.
Predominant among the developed models is the Biotic Ligand Model (BLM),
which considers exposure to be directly related to metal bound to
specific uptake sites (biotic ligands) on the target organism, with
chemical speciation in the medium and competition for binding to the
biotic ligand(s) accounted for. Similarly to the BLM, WHAM-FTOX is based
around the concept of computing amounts of metal bound to the organism.
However, rather than computing amounts of metals bound to assumed
specific biotic ligands, WHAM-FTOX assumes that exposure to metals is
proportional to the amount of metal bound by all weak-acid coordination
sites on or in the organism, in equilibrium with the surrounding medium.
An overall toxic response for mixtures of cations (metals and protons)
is quantified as a toxicity function <i>F</i><sub>TOX</sub>, given by
<i>F</i><sub>TOX</sub> = ∑ <i>α</i><sub>i</sub> <i>ϴ</i><sub>i</sub>
where the exposure to each cation is given by <i>ϴ</i><sub>i</sub> (the fractional
occupancy of binding sites) and <i>α</i><sub>i</sub> is a toxicity coefficient
specific to each cation. Amounts of bound cations are computed using the
WHAM chemical speciation model, taking the amounts bound to humic acid
(HA) as proxies for amounts bound to organisms. This approach has the
advantage that constants for cation binding are already available,
rather than needing to be derived as with the BLM, and that mixture
effects are readily computed. Furthermore, the toxic effects of proton
binding can be included in the mixture exposure modelling.

<p style="text-align:justify">Initial applications of WHAM-FTOX focused on describing field community
effects in freshwaters impacted by acidification and metal contamination
in a number of locations including the UK and North America. Subsequent
work has focused on modelling accumulation and mixture effects in
laboratory toxicity tests. Most recently, the model has been used in a
meta-analysis of single metal–single species laboratory toxicity data
with the aim of providing a unifying picture of toxic effects through
time and across metals and organisms. Collectively, this body of work
demonstrates the utility of WHAM-FTOX as a unifying tool for
understanding and predicting the toxicity of cation mixtures from the
laboratory to the field, from single species to whole communities.
Prospects for the future include the use of the model to predict mixture
field effects based on calibration to laboratory data.

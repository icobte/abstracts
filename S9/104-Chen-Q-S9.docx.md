<p style="text-align:justify">Fluorine is micro-nutrient which is essential for human health, and the
excessive intake or deficiency causes health problems. High-fluorine
groundwater in coastal plains has been widely documented in China and
other countries, including the northern Shandong province of China. The
groundwater fluorine levels, its distribution, epidemiology and
health-related impacts in the coastal plains of the northern Shandong
province were widely investigated, but its enrichment mechanisms and
influencing factors are still unknown. Seawater intrusion, a common
geological process, greatly changes groundwater geo-chemical properties,
especially resulting in high pH, Na<sup>+</sup>, TDS, Cl<sup>-</sup> and low Ca<sup>2+</sup>.
Additionally, the groundwater fluorine is elevated under the conditions
of high pH, Na<sup>+</sup> and low Ca<sup>2+</sup>. But the process of seawater intrusion
has not been noticed when the enrichment mechanism is discussed. The
groundwater samples in typical fluorosis area of the northern Shandong
province were gained. The high-fluorine groundwater is characterized by
seawater intrusion, with high electrical conductivity (EC), total
dissolved solids (TDS), hardness, Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>.
The fluorine levels in groundwater was positive correlated with Ec, TDS,
Cl<sup>-</sup>, Br<sup>-</sup>, Li<sup>+</sup> and significantly with Na<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> and
sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). The lab simulation experiments of
fluorine leaching ability was performed. It is confirmed that fluorine
leaching-ability of sediments in the aquifers increases with the higher
ratios of seawater or brine water, higher levels of NaCl and NaHCO<sub>3</sub>,
and the lower levels of CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, seawater intrusion should be
the important dynamic of fluorosis, which is new insight into
groundwater fluorine enrichment in coastal plains.

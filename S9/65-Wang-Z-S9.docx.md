<p style="text-align:justify">Alga are widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems and play an important
role in arsenic (<i>As</i>) bioavailability and biogeochemical cycling. As
one of important freshwater algae, <i>Microcystis aeruginosa</i> is generally
tolerant to <i>As</i>(V) and exhibits a stronger <i>As</i> bioaccumulation
capacity compared to other freshwater algae. Many abiotic factors affect
the metabolic functions of alga contaminated by <i>As</i>, such as <i>As</i>
levels, hydrogen ion levels (pH), and key nutrient concentrations of
nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in culture media. To date, very limited
information is available on how and to what extent environmental factors
influence arsenic (<i>As</i>) biotransformation and release in freshwater
algae. To further understand environmental factors that impact <i>As</i>(V)
bioaccumulation, we investigated <i>As</i> bioavailability and
biotransformation in <i>M. aeruginosa</i>, aspects of its growth,
intracellular <i>As</i> accumulation in algae cells, and release after algae
death. Also, we examined the influences of three different DOP forms
(β-sodium glycerophosphate (βP), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and
D-Glucose-6-phosphate disodiumsalt (GP)) and inorganic P of phosphate
(IP) on <i>As</i>(V) toxicity, accumulation and biotransformation in
<i>Microcystis aeruginosa</i>. We found that N is critical for M. aeruginosa
<i>As</i>(V) biotransformation to occur, particularly with regard to
<i>As</i>(III) transformation. Also, <i>As</i> accumulation benefited from low P
levels when combined with high N concentrations. Phosphate was second to
<i>As</i>(V) as the primary factor to affect <i>As</i> accumulation. Additionally,
we found that the small amounts of <i>As</i> that accumulated under low
concentrations of <i>As</i> and high P were tightly stored in living algal
cells and were easily released after cell death. Meanwhile, arsenic accumulation in algal
cells were thus greatly enhanced under DOP conditions especially βP
since there was highest intracellular TP under βP treatment.
Furthermore, <i>As</i>(V) reduction and subsequent <i>As</i>(III) methylation was
greatly facilitated in <i>M. aeruginosa</i> by DOP, particularly GP, which
confirmed by its higher relative expression of two functional genes
including arsC and arsM. Furthermore, higher P distribution in MSF under
IP treatment could explain that the tested algae have lower toxic stress
compared to DOP treatments. Meanwhile, higher MSF distribution of <i>As</i>
in <i>M. aeruginosa</i> under DOP conditions can explain higher toxicity with
lower 96 EC50 values. Our results will be helpful for the understanding,
practical applications, and overall control of the key environmental
factors, particularly those associated with algal bioremediation for
<i>As</i>-polluted water. This study was jointly supported by the National
Nature Science Foundation of China (project nos. 41401552, 41271484 and

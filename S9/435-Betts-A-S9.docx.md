<p style="text-align:justify">Informed risk assessment of As-contaminated land is lacking because the
factors controlling Arsenic (As) relative bioavailability (RBA) from
oral ingestion of soil fines (&lt;250 Î¼m) are still unclear. For many
metals, chemical speciation is predictive of solubility and subsequent
bioavailability. However across a range of soil fines, As speciation
alone was not predictive of juvenile swine relative bioavailability
(RBA). All As was identified by As EXAFS as adsorbed onto Fe or Al-oxide
mineral surfaces but % As RBA ranged between 11-55%. Sequential
extraction of As indicated that the % As RBA was comparable to the % As
extracted from the ammonium oxalate in the dark extraction step, which
extracts amorphous Fe and Al-oxides. We hypothesized that Fe-oxide
abundance and solubility may be more influential to As RBA than As
speciation alone. Fe EXAFS and temperature-dependent Fe<sup>57</sup> Mossbauer
spectroscopy indicated higher iron oxide abundance and crystallinity
correlating with lower %As RBA. Soil Fe oxides are a major factor
controlling As bioavailability and further research should consider Fe
oxide information in risk assessment and remedial plans for
As-contaminated land.

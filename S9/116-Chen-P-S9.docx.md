<p style="text-align:justify">Emerging contaminants gallium (Ga) and indium (In) are commonly used in
semiconductor manufacturing and electro-optical industries. Recent
studies have shown that the concentrations of Ga and In in the
environment are elevated, which might increase our risk of exposure to
Ga and In through crop consumption, and further cause warmful effects to
human health. Due to the facts that rice is the staple food for over 90
% of the population in Asia area, and limited information is available
on the accumulation of Ga and In in rice grains to date, assessing the
potential effect of Ga and In on the plant growth and their accumulation
in rice grains is important. Pot experiments were conducted to
investigate the effects of Ga and In on the growth and the accumulation
of Ga/In in rice plants grown in various soils. Rice plants were grown
in three soils (Pc, TWz and Cf series soils) spiked with 30, 50, 100 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup> of Ga or In, respectively. In acidic
soils (Pc and TWz soils), the concentrations of Ga and In in pore water
were increased with increased concentration of Ga/In-spiked in soils,
and the aluminium (Al) concentration in Pc soils were higher than TWz
soils during the growth time, due to the higher amount of available Al
in Pc soils. In alkaline soil (Cf soil), the results of pore water
indicated the concentrations of Ga, In, and Al were decreased with
growth time in all treatments. In addition, it was also found that the
concentrations of Ga, In, and Al in pore water of Cf soils were lower
than in Pc and TWz soils for the same Ga/In-spiked treatments because of
the lower solubility of those elements in alkaline soils. Based on the
above results, it is predicted that the plant growth and Ga/In
accumulation in rice grains could be affected by the concentrations of
Ga, In and Al in pore water of three tested soils.

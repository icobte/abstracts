<p style="text-align:justify">Understanding metal interactions with aquatic organisms is a key step to
answer many questions about their nutritional importance, their
accumulation and their toxicity. The Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) is a tool
commonly used today to predict and quantify metal bioavailability for
aquatic organisms. According to this paradigm, metal uptake and toxicity
is determined by the binding of metal ions to key surface binding sites
(biotic ligands) that will lead to internalisation. The extent of metal
binding to biotic ligands depends on metal speciation (dissolved ligands
compete with biotic ligands for metal binding) and on the presence of
background cations such as calcium, magnesium and protons (cations and
metals compete for binding with the biotic ligands).In recent years,
metal mixtures have been investigated to identify antagonistic or
synergistic effects. These studies usually examine the impact of two or
more non-essential elements. However, little attention has been paid to
the role of essential trace elements on the toxicity of another element.
In this work, we examined if the use of low concentrations of essential
elements (Co, Mn, Zn and Fe) modified the response of a freshwater green
alga (<i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i>) to copper. To do so, we followed cell
growth over 72 h in exposure media where the essential element
concentrations were manipulated. Among these elements, iron proved to
have a strong impact on the cells’ response to copper. Dose-response
curves showed that free Cu<sup>2+</sup> concentrations required to inhibit
cellular growth by 50% (IC50) over 72 h decreased from 2 nM in regular
Fe medium ([Fe<sup>3+</sup>] = 10<sup>-17.6</sup> M) to 4 pM in low iron medium
([Fe<sup>3+</sup>] = 10<sup>-19.0</sup> M); a 500-fold increase in toxicity. These
results show clearly that iron plays a protective role against copper
toxicity to <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This assertion is consistent with the
results of Cu accumulation inside the algae during their exposures to
Cu<sup>2+</sup> under both low and regular iron conditions. From the accumulation
curves, it appeared that, at low Cu<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (pCu ~13.0 to
pCu 10.5), Cu accumulation inside <i>C. reinhardtii</i> increases under low
iron conditions but remain relatively stable under regular iron
conditions. In this range of [Cu<sup>2+</sup>], copper accumulation reached up
to ~150 amol·cell<sup>-1</sup> representing a 6-fold increase compared to that
observed in algal cells grown in the regular iron medium. This last
result confirms the plausible existence of protective effect of Fe<sup>3+</sup>
against Cu<sup>2+</sup> uptake in <i>C. reinhardtii</i>. This protective role could
partly be explained by the antagonistic effects between Fe<sup>3+</sup> and
Cu<sup>2+</sup> at the binding sites of metals on the cell surface (i.e. BLM) but
possibly also by a feedback mechanism linked to iron nutrition. We
hypothesise that at low iron conditions, the cells increase the number
and/or the affinity of iron transporters and that copper is internalised
via this uptake mechanism, resulting in higher copper uptake and
toxicity. In freshwaters, as opposed to marine waters, iron is always
abundant. The expected free iron concentrations in surface waters can
vary between 10<sup>-14</sup> to 10<sup>-20</sup> M, depending on pH (e.g. when pH
increases from 6 to 8). We conclude that copper toxicity in natural
waters can be modulated by iron geochemistry and that, in some
conditions, the BLM may need to be further developed to account for the
influence of iron.

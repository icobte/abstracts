<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic contamination within our food chains is becoming a global
concern, both from health and agronomic perspectives. Compared to other
cereals, rice can accumulate arsenic to 10-fold higher levels. The two
major species of arsenic found in rice plants are arsenite
(As (III)), an inorganic form of arsenic,
highly toxic to humans and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), an organic form
of arsenic, that is relatively non-toxic. The majority of studies have
focused primarily on the uptake and unloading of As (III) into the
grain, due to increasing health concerns as As(iii) is classified as a
class 1 carcinogen. This has resulted in the speciation of arsenic
within the plant, and the effects different arsenic species have on the
plant being commonly overlooked. Here we aim to improve our
understanding of how different arsenic species affect plant growth and
the role they play in inducing straighthead disease in rice. Utilizing
both hydroponic and field trials, we monitored the uptake and metabolism
of arsenic within rice plants. For hydroponic experiments, the rice
plants were grown in a nutrient solution and exposed to either DMA or As
(III) at varying concentrations. For the field trials, straw was
incorporated into the field during planting at 10tone/ha. Our studies
showed that elevated DMA concentrations within rice plants can result in
reduced plant health and development. This suggests that plants
metabolise DMA differentially to As (III). When investigating the
relationship between arsenic speciation and total arsenic accumulation
within rice grain, we have found that inorganic arsenic concentrations
follow a hyperbolic pattern and level out around 0.2 mg/kg. DMA,
however, DMA does not follow this pattern. DMA continues to accumulate
as total arsenic concentration increases and as a result, has the
potential to accumulate at much higher concentrations within the plant.
The uptake pathways and metabolism of DMA are mostly unknown. With
growing global concern of arsenic contamination in the environment, DMA
could pose a real concern for crop health and productivity.

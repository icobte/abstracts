<p style="text-align:justify">Rice is produced and consumed in many parts of the world and is the
dominant staple food for over half of the world’s population, especially
in South and Southeast Asian developing countries. Rice is a complex
matrix made up of components of significant nutritional importance.
However, it also contains toxic trace elements. Compared to other
cereals and terrestrial-based foods, rice grain accumulates heavy metals
such as cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) more efficiently. This is because
rice plants cultivated in flooded soils takes up heavy metals from
irrigated water more easily than other terrestrial crops. Food
consumption has been identified as the major pathway for human exposure
to potential toxic elements compared to other exposure ways such as
inhalation and dermal contact. Once consumed, heavy metals can
accumulated in the body and cause severe health effects in several
internal organs including liver and lung. In China, rice is one of the
main potentially toxic elements sources owing to the great amount of
consumption. Consequently, rice is a major source of potentially toxic
elements intake for much of the China’s population. As such, it has
attracted increasing attention due to exposuring to heavy metals during
rice consumption. In this study, paired soil and rice (n=30) samples
were collected when rice was ready for harvest during July to November
2018. The sampling sites were evenly distributed in soils across a whole
province. All rice samples were powdered with a stainless steel grinder
and soil samples were powdered with an agate mortar and passed through a
100-mesh sieve. The content of total heavy metals (Cd and As) in rice
and soil samples were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Soil
contamination by heavy metals were much more serious in southern China
due to mining, smelting and acidic nature of soils. Locally-produced
rice is the main staple food for local residents. The aims of the study
were to: 1) analysis heavy metals concentrations in rice and soil; 2)
assess non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks caused by heavy
metals contaminated by rice consumption. The result helps to develop
strategies to reduce the transport of heavy metals from soil to rice in
the investigated regions.

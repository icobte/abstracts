<p style="text-align:justify">Novel research efforts focusing on development and application of
bioaccessibility methods to predict trace element contaminant
bioaccessibility and bioavailability have greatly increased
globally. Advances in bioavailability science has led to implementation
of bioavailability and bioaccessibility methods that predict
bioavailability into risk assessment and remedial strategy of
contaminated soil.  Select advances in the science of bioaccessibility
methods to predict soil trace element bioavailability to human and
ecological receptors will be highlighted in the presentation.
Specifically, the ability of several international bioaccessibility
methods to predict relative bioavailable arsenic (RBA As) for 12
contaminated sites. In general, bioaccessibility methods were predictive
of RBA As for arsenic contaminated soils but several methods
underpredicted RBA As when applied to the 12 contaminated sites. Arsenic
speciation alone was not predictive of IVBA or RBA As. However, As
speciation is very important to provide information on the ability of
bioaccessibility methods to predict RBA As results. Supplemental
contaminant source information (i.e., arsenic speciation) may be
required for proper selection of methods by risk assessors to accurately
predict RBA As and human exposure. Specific advances important to
implementation of bioaccessibility methods to adjust bioavailability and
human and ecological exposure to Pb in industrial and/or urban soils
will be presented.

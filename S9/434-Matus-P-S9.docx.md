<p style="text-align:justify">The prediction of soil-plant metal bioavailability using the chemical
extractions is a conventional approach routinely used in soil testing.
The aim of the present study was to evaluate the adequacy of optimized
BCR (Community Bureau of Reference) three-step sequential extraction
procedure (SEP) and single extraction with dilute HCl for the prediction
of the soil pollutants effects affected by different anthropogenic
sources of the acidification. These procedures were used after their
validation to obtain the distribution of both the major (Al, Fe, Mn) and
trace (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) risk metals in acid soils. The contamined
soil and plant samples were collected from three different acidified
sites of . Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) was used for
determination of Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn. Electrothermal atomic
absorption spectrometry (ET AAS) was used for determination of Cd, Ni,
Pb at low concentration levels. Inductively coupled plasma optical
emission spectrometry (ICP OES) was used for Al. As was measured by
hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HG AAS). The results
show that Mn, Cd and Zn are the most phytoavailable from all nine
studied metals in all three acidified ecosystems. These metals are
significantly absorbed and accumulated by almost all given plants (grass
<i>Festuca Rubra</i>, blueberry <i>Vaccinium Myrtillus</i> L., blackberry <i>Rubus
fruticosus</i>) and their individual parts. In contrast to this fact Al,
As, Pb and Fe are mostly inert to the plant ability to take up these
metals in spite of the finding that both As and Pb occur in the soils on
sampling sites at very high concentration levels. In certain conditions
the studied plants can be remark as the bioanalytical tools for in situ
separation of phytoavailable metals species directly in the ecosystem
and the calculated soil-plant transfer coefficients represent the yields
of such bioseparations. They express the ratio of partial soil metal
concentration separated by the plants (represented by total plant metal
concent) to total soil metal content. In this case the studied plants
can be considered for the long-term extraction medium. Also the analyte
phytoaccumulation can play the important role in such phytoseparations
what it is reflected by the soil-plant transfer coefficients higher than
100 %. Therefore the calculated soil-plant transfer coefficients can be
compared with the extraction yield data of all steps and their sums of
optimized BCR SEP and single extraction by dilute HCl applied to soil
samples. Based on these results it could be classified the relative
mobility of studied metals in different soil systems. The work was

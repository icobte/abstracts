<p style="text-align:justify">Sorptive sinks are extensively used in the bioaccessibility of organic
contaminants, but their suitability for simulating the intestinal cell
is seldom reported. In the present study, the sorption efficiency of
PAHs by sorptive sinks including silica, poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate)
(polyE), tenax, and C18 were compared with that by caco-2 cells. The
elimination rate constants of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene,
    benzo(a)pyrene by caco-2 cell were 0.0417 ± 0.006 min<sup>−1</sup>, 0.0411 ± 0.0074
    min<sup>−1</sup>, 0.0362 ± 0.006 min<sup>−1</sup>, and 0.0526 ± 0.0037 min<sup>−1</sup>, respectively,
which were more closely to that of silica and polyE compared to other
materials. This indicated that these materials might be the preferable
sorptive sinks to simulate absorption of PAHs by intestinal cells. The
bioaccessibility of phenanthrene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo(a)pyrene
in indoor dust ranged from 15.5–43.5%, 9.10–38.8%, 10.0–37.9%, and
6.00–21.9%, respectively, based on physiologically based extraction test
(PBET) and the sorptive sinks added in the intestinal solution led to
1.17 to 8.47-fold enhancement of bioaccessibility. The correlation of in
vivo PAHs relative bioavailability (RBA) and in vitro digestion
bioaccessibility with or without the sorptive sinks of indoor dust were
measured, and the results indicated that silica and polyE were more
likely to predict PAHs RBA of indoor dust, which was consistent with the
results of sorption kinetics assay. The present results indicate that
silica and polyE have the potential to simulate caco-2 cell and the
inclusion of these materials in the PBET is likely to predict PAHs RBA
in indoor dust.

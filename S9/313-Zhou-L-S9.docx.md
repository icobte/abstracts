<p style="text-align:justify">Effects of aluminum (Al) on marine organisms have been attracting
increasing attention in recent years. Recent studies show that Al could
be beneficial to the growth of marine
phytoplankton through facilitating the utilization of dissolved organic
phosphorus, iron (Fe), and dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>). It can also influence the
decay and decompostion of biogenic matter. On the basis of this
knowledge, we have proposed the Iron-Aluminum Hypothesis, which proposes
that Al, through enhancing carbon fixation in the upper ocean, and
facilitating the export and sequestration of the fixed carbon to ocean
depths, could play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle and
climate change. In this presentation, I will talk about our new results
on the uptake and subcellular distribution of Al in marine
phytoplankton, and the effects of Al on the carbon fixation of four
marine phytoplankton species (three diatoms and one cyanobacterium) and
the decay of the fixed organic carbon by using radiocarbon (<sup>14</sup>C). Our
results provide strong evidence that marine diatoms can take up and
internalize Al into their cells, with a rate comparable to the
internalization flux of Fe to the same diatom. Once being assimilated,
Al was partitioned to subcellular components in the following order:
granules (69 ± 5%) &gt; debris (17 ± 4%) &gt; organelles (12 ± 2%) &gt;
heat-stable peptides (HSP) (~2%) &gt; heat-denaturable proteins (HDP)
(&lt; 1%), indicating that the majority of intracellular Al was
detoxified and stored in inorganic forms, and substantial Al was further
transported to organelles (e.g., chloroplast). Consistent with our
previous results of the beneficial effects of Al on the growth of marine
phytoplankton, the presence of Al enhanced carbon fixation by the tested
marine phytoplankton species (up to 9%–29% for <i>Thalassiosira
pseudonana</i>, 15%–20% for <i>T. oceanica</i>, 15%–23% for <i>T. weissflogii</i> and
6%–13% for <i>Trichodesmium erythraeum</i>). More importantly, our results for the first time showed
that the presence of environmentally relevant concentrations (40 nM to
200 nM) of Al could significantly reduce the decay and decomposition of
the phytoplankton-produced organic carbon in seawater media (up to
21%–57% for <i>T. pseudonana</i>, 2%–28% for <i>T. oceanica</i>, 29%–58% for <i>T.
weissflogii</i>, and 28%–57% <i>T. erythraeum</i>). These results provide new
evidence for the Iron-Aluminum Hypothesis.

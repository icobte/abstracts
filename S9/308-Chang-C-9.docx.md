<p style="text-align:justify">The present study deals with the multiple heavy metal pollution in
Enshi, which is known as "the capital of Se in China". We observed
elevated concentrations of heavy metals (Mo, Cd) in shales, soils and
rice plants collected from Enshi. We demonstrated that the weathering of
Se-rich rocks could release substantial amount of heavy metals to the
soils in Enshi. Except Cd and Mo, the other heavy metals have low
bioavailability. The bioavailiable fractions of Cd and Mo account for
41.84%, 10.75% of total Cd and Mo in soils, respectively.
Correspondingly, high mean BAFs of Cd (0.85) and Mo (0.71) were found in
rice. Other heavy metals showed low BAFs in rice. The extremely
enrichment of Se in soils could inhibit the uptake of Cu and Hg. The
mean PDI of Se, Cd, Mo, Zn, Cu are 252 ± 184, 314 ± 301, 1774 ± 1326,
7.4 ± 1.68, 0.87 ± 0.35 mg/day. High risk of Cd and Mo through
consumption of local rice were found for Enshi residents. This study
firstly demonstrated that heavy metal pollution can be serious in
Se-rich areas.

<p style="text-align:justify">The drainage and ammonium leachate of rare earth elements (REEs) mining
activities has brought severe environmental acidification and high
concentration of REEs and saline to the surrounding river. In previous
16S rRNA analyzing result, pH was showed as the major factor affecting
microbial structure, followed by saline and REEs. Furthermore, microbial
phylogenetic analysis identified Archaea represent a significant
fraction (up to 45.5%) of total prokaryotic community under
high-polluted condition. Yet, Archaea remain much less well understood
than Bacteria in terrestrial habitat. To this end, we applied
genome-resolved metagenomics analyses to provide initial molecular
insights into the ecological role of these lesser known, but potentially
important, Archaea in the contaminated river environment. We sequenced
DNA from complex sediment and planktonic consortia from river adjacent
to Dingnan REEs tailings in South China, successfully obtained 19
archaeal draft genomes belonging to two major group: Thaumarchaeota, and
small acidophilic archaea affiliated with Micrarchaeota phyla. Genome
analysis indicated these archaea appear to be capable of
denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to nitric oxide,
ammonia oxidation. Interestingly, they also have sulfate
reduction/oxidation genes suggesting they have an important role in
intermediate sulfur cycling. These study expands our knowledge of
ecological roles of these mesophilic archaea, and reveal their
involvement in carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling in contaminated
river on genomic scale. This work was supported by the National Key R&D
Program of China (2018YFD0800700), and the 111 Project(B18060).

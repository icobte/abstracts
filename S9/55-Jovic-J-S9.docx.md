<p style="text-align:justify">Mountainous terrain of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a source of various
ores which resulted with fifteen coal mines situated in a small area.
Most of these coal mines are in the central and north-east part of the
country. Also in the central part of the country there is a heavy
industry of iron and steel factory. All of these can have an effect on
the concentrations of heavy metals in the agricultural soils. The aim of
our research was to run a preliminary analysis of trace elements (Zn and
Cd) in the agricultural soils of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Soil samples
were collected from five locations in Bosnia and Herzegovina. One
location was in the south (Mostar- 10 samples), two in the central
Bosnia and Herzegovina (Sarajevo – 10 samples and Žepće – 4 samples) and
two in the North, North-west (Banja Luka – 5 samples and Prud – 5
samples). All together we collected 34 soil samples from agricultural
fields at the depth of 0-30 cm. Samples were analysed for the
concentration of total Zn and Cd by the <i>Aqua regia</i> extraction. The
results showed that concentrations of potentially toxic trace element
(Cd) as well as concentrations of micronutrient (Zn) were below the
maximum permissible concentrations (MPC) for agricultural soils. Not
even one sample showed any elevated levels of Zn or Cd. Average
concentration of Zn was 103.7 mg/kg and average concentration of Cd 0.43
mg/kg. There were no significant differences of Zn and Cd concentrations
between investigated locations, although highest values of Zn (120.7
mg/kg) and Cd (0.51 mg/kg) were found in the South (Mostar). When data
was examined by region (North, Central and South) there were statistical
differences for Cd where statistically significant concentrations of Cd
were found in the South, compared to the North. Such significance was
observed only for Cd and not for Zn. However, it is important to
emphasise the concentrations of Cd were not above MPC at any location.
Present research is preliminary investigation, more throughout
investigation, with larger set of data is necessary to better understand
anthropogenic impact on agricultural soils in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

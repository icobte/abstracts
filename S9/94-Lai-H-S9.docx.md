<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium is a non-essential and carcinogenic heavy metal with high
mobility, following plant uptake, different chemical forms of cadmium in
the plants play important roles in the bioaccessibility. In this study,
three species of leafy vegetables and five cultivars per species were
planted in a slightly cadmium-contaminated soil. The chemical forms of
cadmium in the edible parts of raw and blanched tissues were analysed to
assess cookingâ€™s effect on the bioaccessibility of cadmium. Experimental
result shows that cadmium in the raw tissues were major in the inorganic
and water-soluble chemical forms with high mobility and high
bioaccessibility. After blanching using 90 <sup>o</sup>C hot water, the primary
chemical forms changed to undissolved phosphate, oxalate, and residual
forms. The bioaccessibility of cadmium in the blanched tissues was
decreased compared with raw tissues.

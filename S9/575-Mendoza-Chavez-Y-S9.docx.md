<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic concentrations of 3 mg/L are known to be lethal to zooplankton.
Yet, a species namely <i>Paracyclops chiltoni</i> (Copepoda: Cyclopoida), has
been reported to inhabit arsenic-contaminated surface water containing
up to 53.23 mgAs/L in central Mexico. To investigate the structure
(abundance, body length, and sex ratio) of this community as well as any
potential morphological adaptation, we collected both zooplankton and
water samples over a 4 year period. We determined water temperature, pH,
electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and oxidation reduction
potential. We also determined total arsenic concentration in water
samples in the laboratory. Next, we identified <i>Paracyclops chiltoni</i>
organisms and determined abundance, body length and sex ratio and
compared <i>Paracyclops chiltoni</i> morphology to published literature. The
concentration of arsenic in water ranged from 25.5 mg/L to 65.2 mg/L,
​​exceeding both the Mexican guideline for the protection of aquatic
life (0.2 mg/L) and the lethal concentration of arsenic (3 mg/L). Water
temperature ranged from 18.3 °C to 22.7 °C. Water pH values were between
6.7 and 7.1. Electrical conductivity ranged from 2.7 mS/cm to 6.6 mS/cm,
which was slightly higher than typical values for freshwater. Dissolved
oxygen ranged from 0.06 mg/L to 4.54 mg/L, while oxidation reduction
potential  ranged from 158 mV to 484.2 mV, indicating a suboxic-oxic
system. Chloride concentrations ranged from 182.3 mg/L to 203.4 mg/L. In
general, we found <i>Paracyclops chiltoni</i>’s abundances were low compared
to common abundance of zooplankton in non-contaminated waters.
Zooplankton abundance was lowest in rainy season (0.8 ind/L) but highest
during dry season (53.6 ind/L). Sex ratios (female:male) were lowest
(0.5:1) during rainy season, while they were highest (21:1) during dry
season. In copepods, sex ratio is strongly inclined towards females. In
regards to the body length, females were between 607 and 747 μm, while
males were between 605-733 μm, showing no significant differences to
commonly reported sizes for females (556-857 μm) and males (351-751 μm).
No differences were found between the morphology of <i>Paracyclops
chiltoni</i> living in arsenic contaminated water against the same species
described in literature. Further studies are, however, needed to
investigate possible genetic adaptations and bioconcentration and
speciation of arsenic in the organisms. <i>Paracyclops chiltoni</i> abundance
showed an inverse relationship to oxidation reduction potential,
dissolved oxygen, and chloride. Results from this study contribute to
the discovery of new aquatic metallotolerant organisms, inhabiting
highly contaminated water in epicontinental waters.

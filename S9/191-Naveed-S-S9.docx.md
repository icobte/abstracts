<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic (As) contamination of groundwater and its health impacts have
become a global-environmental and health threatening issue due to access
of toxic As into the drinking water through naturally leaching from
rocks, mining and other industrial processes. This carcinogenic
metal(loid) mostly exist in the environment as toxic inorganic arsenate
(As<sup>V</sup>) and arsenite (As<sup>III</sup>). Therefore, remediation of As pollution
in water has been studied intensively.

<p style="text-align:justify">Microalgae widely exist in aquatic environments and their extracellular
polymeric substances (EPS) contribute to dissolved organic matter (DOM).
These macromolecules encompass many functional groups such as carboxyl,
phosphoryl, hydroxyl and sulfhydryl, which may affect the mobility and
transformation of heavy metal(loid)s through various interactions.
However, more investigations are still needed to reveal how EPS
influences the As accumulation and speciation in microalgae. In this
study, we hypothesized that EPS could modify the As metabolism in the
microalgal cells. In order to verify this hypothesis, the effect of As
on the EPS synthesis of one cyanobacteria, <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803 (PCC)
and one green microalga, <i>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</i> was investigated.
In addition, we determined the As adsorption, absorption and speciation
in the two strains with and without EPS upon different As treatments
(<i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803: 0-500 µM As<sup>III</sup> and As<sup>V</sup>; <i>C. reinhardtii</i>:
0-10 mg L<sup>-1</sup> As<sup>III</sup> and 0-200 µg L<sup>-1</sup> As<sup>V</sup>). Results showed that the
EPS yield of <i>Synechocystis</i> PCC6803 was significantly increased with
addition of As in the medium and the amount was significantly higher in
response to As<sup>(III)</sup> than As<sup>(V)</sup> treatment. The cyanobacterial cells
with EPS accumulated up to 8 % and 30 % more As<sup>(III)</sup> and As<sup>(V)</sup> than
the EPS-removed cells, along with absorption capacity of 596.57 µg g<sup>-1</sup>
DW of As<sup>(III)</sup> and 751.17 µg g<sup>-1</sup> DW of As<sup>(V)</sup> respectively.
Adsorption and oxidation/reduction of As<sup>(III)</sup> and As<sup>(V)</sup> by the
PCC6803 cells were also significantly higher in the presence of EPS. In
comparison, there were no significant impact of EPS on the concentration
of As in the <i>C. reinhardtii</i> cells. The synthesis of EPS was not
affected by the As treatments either. However, after the removal of EPS,
As adsorption on the cell surface increased and much less As<sup>V</sup> was
reduced to As<sup>III</sup>. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses revealed
that the EPS of both strains was enriched with functional groups such as
C-O-C, NH, and OH, suggesting that the EPS could contribute to
accumulation and redox transformation of As in the microalgal cells and
they have potential to be applied in the As bioremediation in aquatic
environments. Nevertheless, the roles of individual components of EPS
(e.g., polysaccharides, proteins, etc.) in the As accumulation and
transformation and mechanism for the EPS synthesis in the microalgae
under As stress still require further studies.

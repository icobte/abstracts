<p style="text-align:justify">Phytomanagement options with woody or herbaceous species represents a
relevant option from an ecological and economic point of view for the
management of large areas contaminated by potentially toxic trace
elements such as trace metals and metalloids (PTTE) (Algreen et al.
2013; Bart et al, 2015; Malá et al. 2010; Toillon et al. 2013). However
the long-term stability of immobilized PTTE in soils undergoing
phytoremdediation should be predicted for various environmental
scenarios (Cornelis et al, 2008). Moreover the PTTE ecodynamicshould be
explored under rhizospheric processes rather than bulk soil.
Rhizospheric soil corresponds to a geochemical micro-environment
influenced by plants (root exudates composed of organic acids and
siderophores, respiration) (Cadwell 2005) and microorganism activities
(Hiltner 2004). These biological activities locally influence the
ecodynamic of PTTE, either directly (precipitation, complexation,
adsorption) or indirectly (effects of the rhizosphere on pH and redox
potential, dissolution of minerals). Globally biological and soil
processes may be strongly impacted by phytomanagement options.

<p style="text-align:justify">Risks of PTTE in terrestrial ecosystems are currently evaluated on the
basis of the soil total concentration although it does not well predict
toxic effects in soil organisms and plants (Crommentuijn et al., 1997).
However an accurate assessment of bioavailability must consider both
speciation of PTTE in the rhizopshere as well as the biological
receptors they can reach. Speciation in solution is unequivocally
considered to be an effective way to estimate the bioavailability and
toxicity of PTTE to soil organisms. Conversely, simultaneous
investigations of PTTE ecodynamic in rhizospheric soil pore waters (SPW)
and ecotoxicological effects have several advantages. The aim of this
work was thus to assess the speciation, phytoavailability and potential
remobilization of PTTE such as Zn, Pb, Cd, As and Ba in contaminated
mine soils with selected laboratory experiments based on concentrations
of the different metal(loid)s in both rhizospheric (SPW) and in plant
tissues in a context of assisted phytoremediation together with
speciation modelling in the SPW. Effects of <i>Salix viminalis</i> (willow)
and <i>Lolium perenne</i> (ray grass) together with biochar (BC) amendment on
the ecodynamic (characterization, speciation, mobility and
phytoavailability) of these PTTE under rhizosphere influence were
investigated in a pot experiment over 2 months. Results showed that
soluble concentrations of Pb and Zn were decreased through time in
contrast to As and Cd while Ba was increased. Experimental data from
these time series were modelled with the humic ion-binding model
included in the Windermere humic aqueous model (WHAM) to predict their
speciation and compared with concentrations and mineralomasses of PTTE
in plant organs. BC combined with plants modified the phytoavailability
of Pb, Zn, Pb and Ba in SPW while it only slightly influenced As and Cd.
BC could indeed act on PTTE accumulation inplant rhizosphere and
sorption on soil phases and thus provide a mechanism for PTTE retention
in the soil in combination with plant roots.

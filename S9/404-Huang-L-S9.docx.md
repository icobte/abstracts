<p style="text-align:justify">Background: Reducing cadmium (Cd) exposure in Cd-polluted areas in Asia
is urgently needed given the toxic effects of Cd. The short-term and
long-term benefits of lowering Cd exposure are unknown because of its
long half-life in the body. Objectives: We aimed to investigate whether
an intervention with low-Cd rice in a contaminated area of China reduced
urinary Cd (UCd) levels and improved blood pressure and kidney function
outcomes compared to nointervention in consumers of high-Cd rice in the
same region. Methods: 106 non-smoking subjects were divided into three
treatment groups: the intervention group (replacing homegrown high-Cd
rice with market low-Cd rice, n=34), the non-intervention group
(continue eating high-Cd rice, n=36) and the control group (continued
eating low-Cd rice they have been eating for years, n=36). The
intervention period lasted for almost 8 months, during which
participants were visited on up to 4 occasions and UCd, systolic and
diastolic blood pressure (SBP, DBP), kidney function biomarkers
(β2-microglobulin and Nacetyl-β-D-glucosaminidase) were measured.
Results: After 3 months, the geometric mean UCd in the intervention
(Int) group decreased significantly by 0.32 μg/g (p=0.007), while
changes were not significant in the non-intervention (non-Int) group
(0.13 μg/g, p=0.95) or the control group (−0.01 μg/g, p=0.52). UCd in
the Int group remained lower than in the non-Int group but higher than
in the Control group through the end of follow up. DBP in the Int group
decreased significantly from 80mmHg at month three (p=0.03) and stayed
around 74mmHg for the remainder of the study. SBP also decreased in the
Int group but with variations similar to those observed in the other two
groups. The two kidney biomarkers showed variations without a clear
pattern. Conclusion: This study suggested that UCd reflected both
short-term (&lt; 3 months) and long-term Cd exposure. In addition, the
low-Cd rice intervention showed initial benefits in lowering blood
pressure levels, especially DBP, but not kidney biomarkers.

<p style="text-align:justify">Humans are exposed to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through an
ever-expanding array of consumer and industrial products. Because of their anti-bacterial
properties, AgNPs are imbedded in applications ranging from keyboards
and cosmetics, to sports garments, wound dressings, and medical devices.
AgNPs are also used as a catalyst in fuel cells or as a fuel additive.
This emergence increases exposure to this compound of potential concern,
and the associated risks to human heath must be characterized. The
present work focusses on the inhalation pathway and human exposure to
spherical AgNPs with a diameter of 25 nm, which are commonly used in
wound dressings. Inhalation conditions were set to represent the typical
breathing of an adult male exposed to guideline concentrations of AgNPs
of 10 micrograms per cubic meter (National Institute of Occupational
Health and Safety). Computational fluid dynamics models of the
inhalation pathway were generated using COMSOL Multiphysics to estimate
the flux of AgNPs in aspirated air, in lung fluid, and through alveolar
epithelium. In parallel to this in-silico study, a series of
bioaccessibility tests were conducted in vitro to estimate the
physico-chemical behaviour of AgNPs in simulated lung fluids using a
modified Physiologically-Based Extraction Test (PBET). The resulting
solutions were then placed in a Parallel Artificial Membrane
Permeability Assay (PAMPA) to estimate the concentration of silver in
solution and the number of AgNPs in the permeate. PBET and PAMPA
extracts were analysed using Inductively-Coupled Plasma – Mass
Spectrometry and by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The COMSOL simulations
reached steady state within 100 seconds, at which point results showed
an average flux of 3.5 E-19 moles AgNPs per square meter per second. At
such a rate of constant exposure, which represents a worst-case
scenario, the lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) of 5
microgram per millilitre of blood is reached within 10 years. These
findings are similar (p &lt; 0.05) to analytical results following the
PBET and PAMPA, indicate that COMSOL could be a useful tool to model
potential exposure to AgNPs in a variety of scenarios. This initial set
of results, based only on the inhalation exposure pathway, suggest that
the current trends in the use of AgNPs would not constitute risks to
human health in the short term because punctual exposure remains below
LOAEL. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate exposure to
AgNPs from a holistic point: incorporating data from incidental
ingestion and dermal exposure, as well as validating the results through
in-vivo studies.

<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic pollution poses a serious threat to the surface water
environment safety of lakes, rivers, reservoirs and other places in many
countries. Serious environmental arsenic pollution has occurred in
countries such as Australia, the United States, Canada, Argentina and
Bangladesh.In China, lakes/rivers such as Xiangjiang River, Bijiang
River, Yangzong Lake and Datun Lake have been widely concerned about
arsenic pollution. Although the arsenic pollution of some lakes has been
effectively controlled over the years, studies have shown that the
massive accumulation of arsenic in the sediments of lakes/river wetlands
remains a significant potential risk that cannot be ignored. In general,
under the influence of changes in soil pH and redox conditions, the
conversion of As in soil between the easily soluble and insoluble
arsenic compounds is a dynamic process. The occurrence of As in the
sediment of lakeside wetland directly determines its toxic effects and
ecological risks. The current sediment-water interface is the key area
for the study of arsenic migration and transformation in the
environment. It mainly focuses on the morphology and risk assessment of
the in situ sediment As in rivers, lakes and offshore waters, and the
effects of different media on the biochemical behavior of arsenic.
Migration and transformation of arsenic in soil-rice systems. However,
there are few reports on the dynamic changes of As morphology and the
corresponding ecological risks in different arsenic-contaminated soils
under wetland habitats. Therefore, A pot experiment was conducted to
study the variation of the process of arsenic speciation transformation
and assess the corresponding environmental risks by risk assessment
coding (RAC) in soil with different treatments of exogenous arsenic (0,
50, 100, 200, 400 mg/kg) at different time (50, 100 and 200 d) by
typical wetland plant <i>Typha angustifolia</i> L. in simulated wetland
habitat. The results showed that the content of non-specific adsorption
state As (F1) and the residue state As (F5) were decreasing
continuously, and the crystal form of iron-aluminum oxide bound state As
(F4) was increasing, from biologically effective to non-biologically
effective. As the experimental time lengthens, the environmental risk of
As in the soil shows a slight increase after the firstly increased, and
showed the middle and low level environmental risk from the middle to
the end of the experiment. The research results provide data support for
the migration of As in wetlands, and have certain theoretical and
practical significance for the ecological restoration of
arsenic-contaminated lakes.

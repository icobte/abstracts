<p style="text-align:justify">Rare earth elements (REEs) is a group of 17 trace elements including the
lanthanide series, yttrium and scandium. They co-occur naturally in
mineral deposits, have similar properties, and are being used
increasingly in new technologies. At low concentrations in soils, plant
growth can been stimulated by REEs; at higher concentrations, toxicity
has been identified for some REEs. Good data for setting soil quality
guidelines for REEs are scant, specifically in the consideration of REE
bioaccessibility in soils, and how that might influence toxicity.
Existing legislation and guidelines for metal ecotoxicity in soils are
generally set at total concentration in soil, with the recognition that
the total embraces metal species that are scantly unavailable to plants,
microorganisms or soil fauna. In some jurisdictions, site specific soil
quality guidelines could be created, including considerations of
bioavailability. Bioaccessibility can be either directly measured or
predicted from soil characteristics; the goal of this work was to
measure bioaccessibilities of Ce, Eu and Nd in soil directly, and
validate these estimates with measurement of accumulation in plants.
Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and CaCl<sub>2</sub> batch extraction
were used to directly measure Ce, Nd and Eu bioaccessibilities in an
organic soil augmented with these REEs in concentrations ranging from 0
to 7500 mg/kg. Extraction of soil REEs with CaCl<sub>2</sub> measures their
instantaneous bioaccessibility, whereas DGT integrates the diffusive
process of a plant roots over time. Fourteen-day pot studies in this
same soil allowed determination of toxicity thresholds (shoot/root
length) and tissue accumulation for these three REEs, for radish, tomato
and durum wheat. Both methods of determining bioaccessible soil REEs
showed linear correlations to the total concentration within the tested
range. Bioaccessible REE concentrations determined by CaCl<sub>2</sub> extraction
were very low â€“ less than 0.05% of the total measured concentrations.
Depletion of the labile pool of REEs in the soil was observed with
prolonged exposures and required metal resupply by soil mixing or
repotting into fresh soil. This might not be needed in soils with a
plant canopy that creates bulk flow of water through the soil, thus
replenishing the supply of trace elements at the root. This is a
consideration for using the DGT as a companion to long-term plant
studies of REE uptake and toxicity. Hormesis was not observed for any of
the three plant species, growing with any of the three REEs. Many, but
not all, endpoints had identifiable toxicity thresholds within the
concentration range tested: EC10 for root or shoot length varied from
&lt;500 mg/kg to &gt;8000 mg/kg, depending on the species and the REE.
These ECs were much higher than previously reported in another study
using OECD soils. Normalizing the ECs from these two studies for
bioaccessibility of REEs in soil resulted in toxicity thresholds that
were more similar, demonstrating the importance of considering
bioavailability in soil quality guidelines for REEs.

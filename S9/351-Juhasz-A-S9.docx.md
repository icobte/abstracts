<p style="text-align:justify">As the commercial importance and prevalence of rare earth elements (REE)
in consumer products grows, information about REE concentrations in the
indoor environment has become increasingly relevant. Household dust acts
as a sink for a wide variety of compounds from consumer products,
building materials and outdoor sources, and is a useful medium for
assessing residential exposures. This study investigated potential human
exposure to REE in household dust via the inhalation and ingestion
exposure pathways. Household dust from homes in 13 cities across Canada
was fractionated to collect a particle size fraction amenable for
inhalation exposure (&lt; 10 µm). Dust was characterised using standard
wet chemistry methodologies with elemental composition quantified using
ICP-MS. Potential REE exposure was assessed using an inhalation in vitro
assay encompassing Hatch’s solution as a simulated lung fluid. The
inhalation assay was linked to the ingestion pathway by extending the
assay to include gastrointestinal (GI) solutions. This simulated a
scenario where following inhalation, household dust was cleared from the
lung, swallowed and passed through the GI tract. In addition, inhalation
exposure was assessed using artificial lysosomal fluid (ALF) a commonly
utilised simulated lung fluid for the assessment of inhalation
bioaccessibility. Among the REE, cerium (Ce; 11.5-552 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>),
lanthanum (La; 7.7-426 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), neodymium (Nd; 1.3-54.2 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>)
and praseodymium (Pr; 3.9-127 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) were most prevalent with higher
concentrations (p &lt; 0.05) observed in homes of smokers compared to
non-smokers. This was attributed to particles of mischmetal alloy
emitted from cigarette lighter flints. When REE inhalation
bioaccessibility was assessed using Hatch’s solution, Ce, La, Nd and Pr
solubility was negligible; values were indistinguishable from background
noise. However, following the transition from lung to gastric phase
(simulating mucociliary clearance), REE bioaccessibility increased
significantly ranging from 4-77%. Higher bioaccessibility (%) was
observed in dust from non-smoking verses smoking households, presumably
due to differences in REE speciation as a consequence of mischmetal
alloy emissions. REE bioaccessibility decreased when in vitro conditions
were modified to reflect the intestinal phase as a consequence of
precipitation events resulting from the increase in in vitro pH (4-29%).
Significantly higher inhalation REE bioaccessibility was observed when
the fluid composition was changed from Hatch’s solution to ALF (1-46%)
as a consequence of ALF’s lower pH (4.5 versus 7.4). Variability in REE
bioaccessibility suggests that REE source is an important parameter
influencing dissolution in biological fluids which may impact on human
health exposure via inhalation and ingestion pathways.

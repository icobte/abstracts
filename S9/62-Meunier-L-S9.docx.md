<p style="text-align:justify">Carcinogenic hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), may form during metallurgical
processing of chromite ores. Chromium naturally occurs in a non-toxic trivalent form,
Cr(III), which may convert to Cr(VI) during smelting, and in the
presence of strong oxidants in tailings and leachates. Large reserves of
chromite ore have recently been identified in the Ring of Fire (Northern
Ontario, Canada). As mining exploitation is imminent, the potential for
Cr(VI) formation and its release to the environment are of concern,
particularly for the local population, including First Nations. Although
the toxicity of Cr(VI) is well known, exposure dosage from mine tailings
is site-specific, difficult to estimate, and few studies have explored
the physico-characteristics of this carcinogen. Chromium-bearing mineral
samples from the region, containing between 31 and 35 wt % Cr(III),
(provided by the Geological Survey of Canada, GSC). Two size fractions
were used: less than 106 microns, and between 45 and 106 microns.
Samples were subjected to a modified Physiologically-Based Extraction
Test (PBET) to estimate the portion of chromium that may become soluble
(i.e. bioaccessible) in simulated digestive fluids. Selected samples
were also mixed with amounts of Cr(VI) synthesized in vitro to examine
the stability of this hexavalent form and its interaction with chromite
ore and tailings. The acidic conditions of the stomach have been
previously shown to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Thus, the selected
bioaccessibility tests include a saliva phase (prior to the gastric and
intestinal phases) to capture a potential worst-case scenario for the
release of Cr(VI) in solution. Extracts were analyzed by colorimetry and
by inductively-coupled plasma – mass spectroscopy to determine the
soluble fraction of Cr(III) and Cr(VI). Preliminary results of PBET
bioaccessibility measurements agree with residue extraction tests
conducted by GSC and indicate that the CR(VI) extracted from mineral
samples is in the range of 32 to 53 mg/kg. The finer particle size
fraction tends to release a greater proportion of Cr(VI). Further tests
are required to expand on these preliminary findings. Results for this
work may be helpful in selecting appropriate chromite ore processing
methods that yield tailings which are less likely to oxidize to Cr(VI).
Furthermore, this work may inform policy regarding environmental and
human health issues surrounding the chromite mining operations in
Northern Ontario.

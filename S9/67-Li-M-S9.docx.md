<p style="text-align:justify">Arsenic (As) is a group I human carcinogen, causing lung, bladder, and
skin cancers even at low As dose. Exposure to As may occur via
consumption of As-containing food as exemplified by many market basket
surveys. Studies showed that mushrooms accumulate As. Being rich in
beneficial antioxidants and minerals, mushrooms are important in Asian
and European cuisines. As a consequence, mushrooms are cultivated and
consumed worldwide. Yet As concentrations, speciation, and localization
in cultivated mushrooms across a large
geographic distribution are unknown. To address data gaps identified
here, this study assessed the concentrations, speciation, and
localization of As in market mushrooms across a large geographic
distribution. It was hypothesized that As concentrations, speciation,
and distribution would vary with mushroom species and geographic
location. To test this, we purchased 141 market mushrooms from 9 species
in 9 cities across China. Variation in As concentrations with mushroom
species was assessed to identify species with elevated As
concentrations. Species with high total As were then subjected to As
speciation using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with
ICP-MS and As localization using laser ablation coupled with ICP-MS.
Finally, the As health risk associated with mushroom consumption was
assessed by incorporating As speciation into daily As intake and cancer
risk calculations. Total As concentrations ranged 0.01–8.31 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>
dw, with <i>A. bisporus</i> (0.27–2.79 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>) containing the highest As
followed by <i>P. ostreatus</i> and <i>L. edodes</i> (0.04–8.31 and 0.12–2.58 mg
kg<sup>−1</sup>). However, As in <i>A. bisporus</i> was mostly organic including
non-toxic arsenobetaine, while <i>P. ostreatus</i> and <i>L. edodes</i> contained
mainly inorganic As (iAs). Based on in situ imaging using LA-ICP-MS, As
in <i>L. edodes</i> was localized to the surface coat of the cap, while As in
<i>P. ostreatus</i> was localized to the junction of the pileus and stipe.
When As speciation and daily mushroom consumption (1.37 g d<sup>–1</sup> dw) were
considered, daily mushroom consumption may result in elevated iAs
exposure, with bladder and lung cancer rates being up to 387 cases per
100,000. Our study showed market mushrooms could be a health risk to the
general public and its production should be regulated. This study showed
valuable data on As concentrations, speciation, and localization in
different mushroom species, which could inspire further studies on the
mechanisms controlling different As accumulation, speciation, and
localization in different mushroom species. It is also important to
identify transporters responsible for the elevated inorganic As
accumulation in <i>L. edodes</i> and <i>P. ostreatus</i>. Following this, it is
possible to take molecular measures to knock down the key transporters
to cultivate low-As mushroom cultivars.

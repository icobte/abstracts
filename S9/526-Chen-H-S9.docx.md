<p style="text-align:justify">Acid mine drainage (AMD), with low pH values and
high concentrations of metals (e.g. Fe, Mn), is a common problem caused
by the oxidation of sulphide minerals, posing seriously risk to
surrounding environment in areas of the southwest China. Previous studies have confirmed that
acidophilc bacterias play an important role in the generation of AMD and
remediation of AMD, but few researches has been
done on the <i>in-situ</i> remediation of AMD in field and little attention
has been paid to the variations of microbial community composition in
such an AMD treatment system. A pilot system consisting of two
oxidation-precipitation cells, two microbial treatment cells and one
setting cell, based on microbiological technology, was constructed to
treat AMD, and has been effectively running over 5 years up to now.
However, we still didn’t know what kind of the microbial community
compositions stay in and how they work in the different cells of the
pilot system. 48 Sediment samples from different treatment cells in
different seasons were collected, and the microbial community
compositions in samples were extracted and analysed the Illumina MiSeq
platform at Novogene bioinformatics company (Beijing, China). The
results showed that the concentrations of Fe, Mn and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup> were
reduced from 920, 46 and 4905 mg/L (inflow) to 71.6, 12 and 3436mg/L
(outflow), with the removal rates are 92% for Fe, 73% for Mn, and 29.9%
for SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, respectively. The increase in pH and decrease of
oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) were also observed along the water
ﬂow direction in the system. We also found <i>Ferrovum</i>,
<i>Metallibacterium</i>, and <i>Leptospirillum</i> were highly enriched in the
pilot cells. Meanwhile, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) results
indicated pH, TS and Amorphous iron oxide were significantly correlated
with the overall microbial communities. And the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group
Method with Arithmetic Mean) tree indicated that distinct microbial
communities developed within this pilot system in different time. Based
on PCoA (Principal Coordinates Analysis), the microbial composition of
each cell was distinct, indicating the physicochemical parameters
including pH, TS and Amorphous iron oxide had
remarkable effects on shaping the indigenous microbial communities.
In
conclusion, it was documented that the pilot system is an appropriate
system for coal AMD remediation, and the significant differences of
microbial community composition were found in different cells of this
system and in different seasons.

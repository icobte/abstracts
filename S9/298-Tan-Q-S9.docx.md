<p style="text-align:justify">Salinity is an important factor that affects the ecological risks of
contaminants, especially metals, in the estuarine environment. Copper
(Cu) is one of the metals with the highest risk due to its widespread
contamination and its high toxicity. The effects of salinity on Cu
toxicity have thus received much attention. However, generalizing the
effects of salinity for risk assessment of Cu is still a challenge,
mainly due to the complex effects of salinity and the substantial
interspecies differences. In this study, we used the
toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model as a unifying framework for simulating
both the bioaccumulation and toxicity of Cu under various salinities and
in three representative euryhaline species, i.e., a fish (<i>Oryzias
melastigma</i>), a waterflea (<i>Moina mongolica</i>), and a clam
(<i>Potamocorbula laevis</i>). The stable-isotope-tracer technique was used
to measure the uptake and depuration of Cu in the organisms. At low Cu
levels (10-20 μg L<sup>−1</sup>), Cu uptake rates generally decreased with the
increase of salinity; at high Cu levels (~500 μg L<sup>−1</sup>), the inhibitive
effects of salinity became less apparent, presumably due to the
saturation of Cu uptakes sites. Nevertheless, different patterns were
observed among species: non-monotonic change of Cu uptake was observed
in the fish and waterflea, suggesting that the effects of salinity were
more than geochemical effects. The effects of salinity on Cu
bioaccumulation could not be directly translated into the effects on Cu
toxicity; the lowest Cu toxicity was observed at intermediate salinities
in all species. The decoupling between Cu bioaccumulation and toxicity
was due to the changes in the intrinsic sensitivity of the organisms
under different salinities, which could be measured by the two
toxicodynamic parameters, i.e., the internal threshold concentration and
the killing rate. The toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model provides a
method for separating and quantifying the multiple effects of salinity
and thus can be served as a tool for better managing the risks of
contaminants in the estuarine waters.

<p style="text-align:justify">Currently the range of soil degradation has been continuously expanded,
and soil quality deterioration has been intensified. Particularly with
the increase of environmental pollution, the risks and damages to human
health caused by the entry of external pollutants such as heavy metals
into the soil attracted great concern of the public. The vast majority
of the external pollutants would be adsorbed by soil active components,
and exposed on the soil chemical interface. Soil interfacial
interactions have profound effects on the sequestration, degradation and
biological metabolism of the pollutants. Therefore, focusing on the
chemical behaviours of external pollutants in soil and developing soil
remediation technologies to meet the social and public needs were of
prime importance. To date, our understanding of the impacts of soil
mineral–organic matter–microbe interactions on the behaviours of heavy
metals in soils, and of an advanced model through soil-plant continuum
is still relatively limited. The application of in-situ measurement,
micro-examination and element tracing technologies significantly
accelerated the development of studies with related to heavy metal
interactions with soil active components. The in-situ measurement and
the greatly improved understanding of soil microscopic properties based
on microscopic spectrum laid solid foundation for the rapid
understanding of immobilizing heavy metals in soil and development of
soil remediation. Quantum chemistry calculation combined with spectral
information has greatly enhanced the understanding of these processes at
the molecular level. Meanwhile, the bioavailability and toxicity of
heavy metal in soil is mostly decided by its speciation, but not by its
total amount. Therefore, it is necessary to make accurate assessments of
heavy metal species and speciation distribution. Geochemical models are
widely used to predict the speciation and transport of heavy metals that
will be important in the control of the solubility, bioavailability and
the fate of heavy metals. The various types of models have been
developed to calculate chemical speciation or the distribution of
chemicals over all relevant forms on different soil active components.
In addition, an advanced model through soil-plant continuum is also
crucial to screen the trace elements from soil particle, to soil
solution and plant rhizosphere. Fundamental understanding of these
reactions and processes at the atomic, molecular, and microscopic levels
is essential for remediation of heavy metal pollution in soils,
sustaining and enhancing soil health, which includes human health, on a
global scale. Future research on this extremely important and exciting
area of science should be stimulated to soil pollution and remediation
as well as sustain the ecosystem integrity.

<p style=text-align:justify>Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is one of the most important
biological processes on earth. BNF is catalyzed by the enzyme
nitrogenase. This metalloenzyme requires molybdenum (Mo) and iron (Fe)
at its active center to reduce atmospheric dinitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>) into
bioavailable ammonium. In addition to the canonical Mo nitrogenase, two
alternative nitrogenases, using vanadium (V) and Fe-only instead of Mo
are known to fix N<sub>2</sub>. Despite the discovery of these alternative
isoforms more than 40 years ago, BNF is still believed to primarily rely
on Mo. This reflects our poor understanding of the importance of trace
metal dynamics on BNF activity and the concomitant question of the
contribution of alternative means of N<sub>2</sub> fixation, using V as metal
cofactor, in natural and anthropogenic habitats.

<p style=text-align:justify>Here, I will first summarise the pilling evidences of a worldwide
limitation of BNF by Mo availability. Over the last 3 decades Mo
limitation of BNF has been reported in ecosystems ranging from tropical
to subarctic latitudes, in both natural (e.g.., forest, tundra) and
anthropogenic (e.g., agricultural soils) environments. The widespread
limitation of BNF by Mo challenges current views on the importance of
alternative nitrogenases to the global N budget. I will thus also
summarise recent studies highlighting the ubiquitous distribution of
alternative nitrogenase genes and the contribution of alternative
nitrogenases to BNF in a wide range of ecosystems.

<p style=text-align:justify>I will then discuss how the contribution of alternative nitrogenases to
BNF challenges our understanding of the role and importance of trace
metal biogeochemistry on BNF. V has long been considered a toxic metal
with limited biological purpose. Our understanding of V acquisition
strategies deployed by N<sub>2</sub> fixers to manage V limitation and toxicity
remains elusive strongly limiting our ability to fully comprehend the
biogeochemical cycling of this important, but mostly ignored, biometal.
The widespread contribution of alternative nitrogenases to BNF also
invites to re-evaluate N input estimates in many ecosystems. Indeed, the
most common methods used to estimate BNF over the last half century
(acetylene reduction assay) significantly underestimate N<sub>2</sub> fixation by
the Mo-independent nitrogenases and thus likely net N input estimates.

<p style=text-align:justify>Finally, I will discuss future research avenues and methodological
developments required to fill current knowledge gaps in nitrogenase
metal cofactors biogeochemistry, including V acquisition at the
soil-N<sub>2</sub> fixers interface, trace metal dynamics in complex biological
communities (i.e., biofilms) and environmental factors controlling the
expression and use of alternative nitrogenases.

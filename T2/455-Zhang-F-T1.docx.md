<p style=text-align:justify>Sediments in riverbanks and nearby lands submitted to flooding events
undergo variations of redox conditions linked to water saturation.
During the periods of anaerobic conditions, the bio-reduction of
minerals containing ferric iron may induce the release of iron and
several trace elements (TE), such as metals or metalloids that are
associated to iron. The objective of the present study is to determine
the mineralogical and microbial factors that constraint the kinetics of
iron and TE release. It is also particularly interesting to determine if
the nature of iron minerals influences the bacterial communities
developed in contact with iron minerals, as biofilms. Complementary
laboratory and on-site experiments were implemented to understand the
interactions between iron oxides and iron-reducing microbial
communities. The first phase of this experimental program included a
characterization of biogeochemical parameters linked to iron reduction
in riverbank sediments. The study site is located in Decize (Burgundy,
France) near a Loire river channel. Three bulk samples submitted to
different regimes of redox conditions were taken: soil from the dry
river bank, flooded soil and sediment under water. First, cores were
characterized using magnetic susceptibility, analysis of total carbon,
total iron and sulfur, Raman and SEM-EDS. The iron-reducing bacteria
<i>Shewanella</i> and <i>Geobater</i> were then searched in the different sediment
samples using specific molecular primers. Samples from the three types
of redox environments were inoculated in specific medium and three
cultured enrichments of iron reducing bacteria were obtained that
totally reduced FeIII-NTA in 1-2 days. Results showed that iron in
sediments presented distinct oxidation states according to the water
level. Some ferrihydrite was identified in an oxidized level by Raman
spectroscopy, whereas iron sulfide globules (1-2 µm) were observed using
SEM-EDS probe in a reducing level, suggesting dissolutive reduction of
iron oxides concomitant to oxidation of organic matter. Additionally,
<i>Geobacter</i> was detected in all soil samples but not the enrichments,
whereas <i>Shewanella</i> was present in the soil, flooded soil and
enrichments but not in the permanent aquatic sediment. In these iron
reducing bacterial communities, <i>Shewanella</i> was present in higher
proportion than <i>Geobacter</i> in enrichments, during the iron reducing
process. The abundance of <i>Geobacter</i> may be linked to the type of iron
oxide mineral.

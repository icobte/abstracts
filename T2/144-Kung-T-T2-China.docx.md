<p style=text-align:justify>Nanoscale lead dioxide (nPbO<sub>2</sub>(s)) is a corrosion byproduct, formed
from the chlorination of lead-containing plumbing materials. This metal
oxide nanoparticle (NP) plays a key role in determining lead pollution
in drinking water and receiving water bodies. Natural water matrices
with different salts or organic matters may affect aqueous redox
conditions, thus altering the stability of nPbO<sub>2</sub>(s) or contributing to
lead (Pb<sup>2+</sup>) releasing. Lead is a toxic metal that causes multiple
adverse effects including neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, deleterious
effects on the hematologic and cardiovascular systems. However, the
interactions of nPbO<sub>2</sub>(s) with water matrices associated toxicity are
less known. This study evaluates the aqueous chemistry and toxicological
responses of nPbO<sub>2</sub>(s) associated to different water matrices using
medaka fish (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>) as a model organism. The medaka larvae
were treated with solutions containing either nPbO<sub>2</sub>(s) or Pb(II)<sub>(aq)</sub>
in soft water with 5mg/L humic acid (SW+HA) or very hard water (VHW) for
10 days. At the endpoint, <i>in vivo</i> toxic effects, consisting of
locomotor activity and neurotoxicity related gene expressions were
measured. The result showed that dissolved salts enhanced aggregation
and sedimentation of nPbO<sub>2</sub>(s) in VHW water. On the contrary, the
presence of HA in water enhanced the particle stability and slightly
accelerated lead dissolution. We observed that nPbO<sub>2</sub>(s) in VHW
solutions showed higher interference in locomotor activities of medaka
larvae, as compared to those in SW+HA solutions. Furthermore, genes
involved central nervous system development (e.g. Î±1-tubulin and myelin
basic protein) or acetylcholinesterase were downregulated with nPbO<sub>2</sub>
(10 and 20 mg/L) in VHW, as compared to the control. Our investigation
indicated a higher toxicological risk (e.g., neurotoxic effect) of metal
oxide NP (e.g., nPbO<sub>2</sub>) when they are present in hard water matrices of
higher ion strength.

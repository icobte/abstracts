<p style="text-align:justify">Lead (Pb) is a highly stable heavy metal in soil-plant system which
severely affects growth, physiology and ion dynamics of plants by
modifying rhizospheric pH. The current study was planned to screen the
pH triggering effects of two <i>Solanum melongena</i> L. cultivars (cv.
Chuttu and cv. VRIB-13) as well as associated plant physiological
responses and ionomic profiles under Pb stress. Plants were grown in
black plastic containers having nutrient solutions supplemented with 0,
15, 20 and 25 mM PbCl<sub>2</sub> with a starting pH of 6.0. The pH and proton
dynamics in the rhizosphere of Pb stressed S. <i>melongena</i> plants were
continuously monitored up to 8 days. Plants were subsequently harvested
and analyzed for different physio-biochemical and ionic attributes. Time
scale studies revealed that cv. Chuttu and cv. VRIB-13 responded by
causing acidosis and basification of growth medium during first 48 h of
Pb stress, respectively. Up to 8 days of Pb treatment, both cultivars
increased the rhizospheric pH except for 20 mM Pb treatment where
rhizospheric acidosis of 0.125 and 0.15 units was recorded for Chuttu
and cv. VRIB-13, respectively. Maximum pH increase of 1.21 units was
recorded for cv. VRIB-13 at 15 mM Pb level and 0.8 units for cv. Chuttu
at 25 mM Pb treatment. Pb toxicity signiÔ¨Åcantly reduced plant biomass,
photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll contents, carotenoids and
anthocyanin), ascorbic acid, total amino acid and total protein and the
effects were significantly more apparent in cv. Chuttu than the cv.
VRIB-13. Interestingly, the chlorophyll contents of cv. VRIB-13
increased with increasing Pb treatment levels. The Pb contents of roots
and shoots of both cultivars increased with increase in applied Pb
levels while nutrient (Ca, Mg, K and Fe) contents decreased
predominately in cv. Chuttu. Due to antagonistic effect of Pb toxicity,
the Na uptake and translocation from roots to shoot was also increased
in both cultivars. Taken together, rhizospheric basification response,
lower root to shoot Pb translocation and optimum balance of nutrients
(Mg and Fe) conferred the growth enhancement, ultimately making the cv.
VRIB-13 auspicious for tolerating Pb toxicity as compared to cv. Chuttu.
The research outcomes are important while devising metallicolous
plant-based strategies to remediate Pb polluted rhizosphere/soils.

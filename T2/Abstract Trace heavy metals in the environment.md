<p style=text-align:justify>In qualitative and quantitative parameters of water-marsh waters can the essence
of one of the major biospheric functions of the wetland accumulation of a
moisture and regulation of a drain is expressed is. On the formation of a
chemical compound of water of the wetlands have influence as quantity (amount)
of the atmospheric precipitation, so and their compound (including pollution).
In turn polluted waters increase pollution of the soils and plants. High
marshiness of territory of Belarus promotes formation peat soils. The researches
have shown, that the most widespread pollutants of the peat soils are heavy
metals: lead, cadmium, copper and radioactive caesium and strontium accumulated
in plenties after Chernobyl accident .

<p style=text-align:justify>The capacity of the accumulation of heavy metals in peat soils is very high, but
durability of communication is various: in the soils with a little ash and semi
desintegrated peats is lower, than in the turbaries with high ash. The content
of the carbonates in peat soils increases durability of fastening of heavy
metals. The selective character of the accumulation of the cations of heavy
metals is caused by features of hydration of the gymin acids. The link of
caesium and strontium is defined(determined) mainly by carboxylic groups of
gymin acids. The constants of stability has shown, that the gymin acids are
vigorous complex formation substances much more exceeding complex formation of
properties acetic, citric and other organic acids. The organic compounds can
form strong insoluble complex compounds with metals at the specific values рН.
At the same time heavy metals at formation of complexes with gymin and phulvo-
acids get the big migratory ability.

<p style=text-align:justify>The study of accumulation of radioisotopes of strontium-90 and caesium-137 by
plants has shown, that concentration of the radionuclides in the plants on 2-3
order is more, than in the water. The coefficient of accumulation of the
radioisotopes Cs 137 as a rule is higher, than on Sr 90. Some differences in the
coefficients (factors) of accumulation of strontium - 90 between plants on
various soils are observed.

<p style=text-align:justify>The application of the fertilizers of phosphorus and potash reduced of the
coefficient ( factor) of the accumulation of heavy metals in the plants
especially at their joint application together with the microelements.

CONCLUSIONS

<p style=text-align:justify>1.The general law of allocation of total and mobile forms of heavy metals on
genetical horizons of soils is revealed.
<p style=text-align:justify>2.The study of ability of mobile forms
Zn and Pb accumulate in upper organogenic horizons of various phylums of soils
and ability of mobile forms Zn, Pb, Cu to concentrating on erect geochemical
barriers on borders of change of genetical horizons of soils.

<p style=text-align:justify>3.The influence of the total pollution of the soil by lead and by cadmium on
arrival of heavy metals in plants is determined. It was established, that influence of lead at
the presence of cadmium in soil on the vegetation of plants is stronger, than at contamination
of the soil only by lead or only cadmium.

<p style=text-align:justify>4.Are investigated of the forms of a presence(finding) radionuclides in
podsolic sandy soil

<p style=text-align:justify>Phytoremediation of cadmium (Cd)-contaminated soils using
(hyper)accumulating plants is considered to be a promising technique,
especially for moderately-polluted soils. However, most plants used for
Cd phytoremediation are glycophytes and hence not suitable to remediate
contaminated saline soils. Australian native halophyte <i>Carpobrotus
rossii</i> produces high biomass, and has been shown to tolerate a mixture
of heavy metals and to accumulate Cd. However, limited information is
available on the effect of salinity on Cd phytoextraction and associated
mechanism in this species. This study examined the effect of salinity on
Cd accumulation, translocation, and speciation in <i>C. rossii.</i> Plants
were grown in nutrient solution with different types and levels of salts
in the presence of Cd. Plant growth and Cd uptake were measured, and Cd
speciation analyzed using synchrotron-based X-ray absorption
spectroscopy.

<p style=text-align:justify>In the first experiment, increasing NaCl concentration from 0 to 100 mM
in nutrient solution without Cd did not significantly affect plant
growth. At 15 μM Cd, NaCl addition increased plant relative growth rate
by up to 82%, which had resulted from decreases in Cd root uptake and
root-to-shoot translocation and hence shoot Cd accumulation. Increasing
NaCl addition decreased the concentration of phytochelatins, while the
concentration of phytochelatins correlated positively with Cd
concentrations in plants. The responses of organic acids and amino acids
in plants to the addition of Cd and NaCl were inconsistent.

<p style=text-align:justify>The second experiment confirmed that salt addition decreased shoot Cd
accumulation due to decreased root-to-shoot translocation, irrespective
of salt type (25 mM NaNO<sub>3</sub>, 12.5 mM Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or 25 mM NaCl). The
decrease in Cd translocation was not due to changes in Cd speciation
within the plant tissues after 10- to 20-d treatment. After 10-d
treatment, 61-94% Cd was bound to S-containing ligands (Cd-S) in plant,
while the Cd in the xylem sap existed as free Cd<sup>2+</sup> or complexes with
carboxyl groups (Cd-OH). However, when exposed to Cd for ≤ 24 h, 70% of
the Cd in the roots was present as Cd-OH. Furthermore, salt addition
increased the proportion of Cd-S but decreased that of Cd-OH in the
roots within 24 h, which was not due to changes in glutathione and
phytochelatin concentrations in plant tissues.

<p style=text-align:justify>In conclusions, salinity could decrease shoot Cd accumulation by
decreasing Cd root-to-shoot translocation even under constant Cd<sup>2+</sup>
activities in the growing media. The decreased Cd translocation had
partly resulted from the rapid formation of less-mobile Cd-S complexes
within the root. Peptides and organic acids, particularly
phytochelatins, played an important role in plant Cd tolerance and
accumulation although the changes of those metabolites were not the main
reason for the decreased Cd accumulation in <i>C. rossii<i>.

<p style=text-align:justify>As a mineral resource, Antimony (Sb) has been widely used in various
industrial products. However, excessive antimony in the soil and water
environment can cause pollution and is harmful to human beings. The
adsorption of Sb(III) and Sb(V) on Mn-coated biochar using batch experiments was studied in this paper. Mn-coated biochar was simply synthesized through the reaction of
biochar with different MnSO<sub>4</sub> concentrations in
aqueous solution. It is confirmed the successful coating of Mn on the
surface of the biochar from SEM and XRD analysis. It is showed that
MnSO<sub>4</sub> modification greatly increased the particle size of the original
biochar by Laser particle size analyzer and the specific surface area of
Mn-coated biochar is smaller than the untreated biochar by BET analysis.

<p style=text-align:justify>The effects of initial Sb concentration, pH, reaction time, and
temperature at different concentrations on the adsorption of Sb(III) and
Sb(V) were investigated in this research. Kinetic studies indicated that
Sb(III) and Sb(V) reached an adsorption equilibrium within 12 hours.
Both for biochar and Mn-coated biochar, sorption kinetic data better
follows the pseudo second-order model (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.80). The adsorption
data of Sb(III) and Sb(V) at 283 K, 298 K, and 313 K are fitted well by
both Freundlich (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.76) and Langmuir (R<sup>2</sup>&gt;0.76) isotherms. At
298 K, the maximum sorption capacity for Sb(III) calculated from
Langmuir model are 0.3231 mg/g for biocharand 1.5590 mg/g for Mn-coated
biochar. The maximum sorption capacity for Sb(V) calculated from
Langmuir model are 0.2238 mg/g for biochar and 1.2567 mg/g for Mn-coated
biochar. The thermodynamic parameters (ΔG<sup>0</sup>&gt;0, ΔH<sup>0</sup>&gt;0, and
ΔS<sup>0</sup>&gt;0) are calculated from the temperature dependence, illustrating
that the adsorption processes of Sb(III) and Sb(V) are endothermic. From
the LC–AFS date of Sb(III) aqueous solution, It is showed that the
oxidation of Sb(III) occurred on a time scale of minutes and Sb(III) was
oxidized to Sb(V) as soon as the reaction began. The sorption process of
Mn-coated biochar was pH independent. It is indicated that physical
adsorption and chemical adsorption of biochar occurred together,
reflected in ion exchange and redox reaction. Strong chemisorptive
binding of Sb to biochar surfaces is further confirmed from FTIR and
XPS.

<p style=text-align:justify>By this study, MnSO<sub>4</sub> modification is a simple and effective method to
increase the sorption capacity of biochar. The process is simple and
easy to operate, and the synthesized material shows delightful sorption
property for Sb(III) and Sb(V).

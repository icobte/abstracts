<p style=text-align:justify>To date, little information is available on the oxidation and reduction
of Sb by bacteria. The biogeochemical effects of microorganisms on redox
potential and mobility of Sb were investigated in this research. A
dissimilatory Sb(V)-reducing bacterium was isolated from stream sediment
samples (Sb 3,069 mg/kg) taken in the vicinity of an Sb oxide-producing
factory in Korea. This anaerobic rod-shaped bacterium reduced Sb(V) and
grew through respiration using 5 mM Sb(V) and 10 mM acetate under pH 7.7
and 30 <sup>o</sup>C. A part of Sb(III) which was produced in anoxic minimal
medium precipitated as a biomineral which was likely Sb(OH)<sub>3</sub>. Based on
the phylogenetics of 16s rRNA gene sequence and DNA G+C content, the
bacterium appears to be a novel strain of the <i>Sinorhizobium</i> genus. The
results suggest that microorganisms may play a significant role in
changing the redox state of Sb and thus geochemical fates of Sb in
geological media.

<p style=text-align:justify>Twelve Sb-resistant bacteria were isolated from the same sediment
samples, and eight of these strains were heterotrophic Sb(III)-oxidizing
bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Sb(III)-oxidizing
bacteria fell within two subdivisions of Proteobacteria. <i>Cupriavidus</i>
sp. NL4 and <i>Comamonas</i> sp. NL11 belong to the subdivision
<i>β-Proteobacteria. Acinetobacter sp. </i>NL1, <i>Acinetobacter sp. </i>NL12,
<i>Pseudomonas sp. </i>NL2, <i>Pseudomonas sp. </i>NL5, P<i>seudomonas sp. </i>NL6, and <i>Pseudomonas sp. </i>NL10 are the members of the <i>γ</i>-subdivision of the
Proteobacteria. Among them, <i>Cupriavidus</i> sp. NL4 completely oxidized
100 μmoles/L Sb(III) in 500 hours. The other strains could not oxidize
all of the Sb(III) in the medium, even with longer incubation. The
results imply that diverse bacterial lineages are able to detoxify sites
polluted with Sb(III) by oxidizing it to Sb(V), and to contribute to
antimony cycling in natural environments.

<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is widely used as additivie in alloys, ceramics, glass and
plastic products in modern industries. As a metalloid element with
potential toxicity and carcinogenicity, Sb pollution in soil and
groundwater has seriously threatened to the human environment for the
combustion of fossil fuel and waste containing Sb and a series of mining
activities. Recent years, Sb isotope technology is used as a new perspective to identify
pollution source and reveal its migration and transformation.

<p style=text-align:justify>In this study, Sb isotopic composition of river water and groundwater
collected in mining area was determined by MC-ICP-MS (Multi-Collector
Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer). A method of
preconcentration and purification was developed and optimized based on
the use of a silica-based thiol resin column, which achieves a
quantitative recovery of Sb (at least 95%). When SPEX (dissolution of Sb
ore) and GSB were used for in-house standard materials of Sb isotope
measurement, it was demonstrated that there was little Sb isotope
fractionation in the proposed method, which the ε<sup>123</sup>Sb falls in the
-0.1 to -0.4 level. Therefore, the method for the preconcentration and
purification of Sb is effective for isotope analysis. Indium (In) was
used as an internal standard for correction of the instrumental mass
discrimination occurring in the MC-ICP-MS instrument. Under the
conditions of Apex injection, the ε^123^Sb value for in-house standard
solution and water samples could be determined with a reproducibility
(or external precision) of 0.04‰.

<p style=text-align:justify>The isotopic composition of the selected water samples shows a variation
of 2 to 3ε units. One groundwater sample showing light isotope
enrichment contrasted Sb isotopic signature of others samples containing
river water and groundwater, which could be related to various
biogeochemical processes when Sb transfers from rocks, mine wastes and
sediments to the water compartment. This result shows that Sb isotope
technology may be useful in tracking pollution sources and
biogeochemical processes in hydrologic systems.

<p style=text-align:justify>Due to the limited water samples and the absence of leachate from
tailings pond and waste heap, a small isotopic variation of samples was
observed. Now the digestion procedure for ore samples especially for
stibnite and slags is developing and optimizing, so the relationship
between potential source of Sb and water environment can be established
in the near future. Assuredly the processes (dissolution, oxidation,
precipitation and adsorption) may generate fractionation during Sb
transports from ore material into the water environment, and these part
of the related experiments will continue to be carried out as soon as
possible.

<p style=text-align:justify><strong>Objective:</strong> Cross-sectional evidence from the NHANES suggested higher
urine antimony was associated with elevated diabetes prevalence in US
adults. The long-term association between plasma antimony and incident
diabetes is uncertain. We aimed to examine the relationship between
plasma antimony and the incidence of type 2 diabetes among Chinese
adults.

<p style=text-align:justify><strong>Methods:</strong> We quantified plasma antimony concentrations by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (Agilent 7700x ICP-MS; Agilent
Technologies, USA) among 1039 incident diabetes cases and 1039 controls
(age and sex matched) nested in a prospective study, the Dongfeng-Tongji
cohort. Both cases and controls were free of diabetes at baseline
(2008-2010), incident diabetes were identified using the following
criteria: fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/l; or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥ 6.5%;
or self-reported diagnosis or use of anti-diabetic medication during the
follow-up visits in 2013. Conditional logistic regression models were
used to assess the odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence
intervals (CIs).
<p style=text-align:justify><strong>Result:</strong> The median plasma antimony concentrations in type 2 diabetes
patients and controls were 0.14 μg/L and 0.16 μg/L, respectively. We
found the plasma antimony concentrations were slightly higher in the
control group (P=0.02). After adjustment of BMI, smoking status,
drinking status, education, physical activity, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, family history of diabetes, and eGFR, the odds ratio
(95% CIs) of type 2 diabetes across quartiles of antimony concentrations
were as follows: 1.00, 0.79 (0.58-1.07), 0.77 (0.57-1.04), 0.60
    (0.44-0.83, <i>P<sub>trend</sub></i>=0.002). With the increase of one unit (1 μg/L) of
plasma antimony, the diabetes risk would decrease 15%. When modeling the
dose–response relationship using restricted cubic splines, we observed a
    negative linear association between antimony concentration (<i>P</i> for
linear relation = 0.002) and type 2 diabetes.


<p style=text-align:justify><strong>Conclusions:</strong> Plasma antimony was negatively associated with incident
type 2 diabetes in Chinese adults. More work is needed to explore the
underlying mechanism of the antimony-diabetes relationship.

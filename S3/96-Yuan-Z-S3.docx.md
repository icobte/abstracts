<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is a priority pollutant in the environment, but much less
attention has been paid for migrating Sb risk than its sister element
arsenic (As). Contaminations of Sb and As are always co-occurring as a
result of mining activities. Interestingly, the behaviours of Sb and As
are quite different under changing redox conditions. Arsenic tends to be
mobilized under reducing conditions as a result of arsenate desorption
from iron oxides reduction as well as its subsequent reduction to
arsenite, while the inverse was observed for Sb. Paddy soils are the
largest artificial wetlands in the world, and supporting the growth of
rice. In order to maintain a high yield, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> fertilizer is usually
applied. It is well recognized NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> is the strongest oxidizer in
saturated soils after O<sub>2</sub> is depleted. However, the influence of
NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> application on Sb mobility remains largely unsolved, but the
relative research would be crucial for mitigating Sb risk in rice
production. We hypothesized the release of Sb in soil water interface
could be triggered by applying NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> fertilizer in flooded paddy
soils. A novel technology, entitled Integrated Porewater Injection (IPI)
profiler, was used to explore the high-resolution (mm level) Sb profile
(10 mm in overlying water and 50 mm in soils) repeatedly in Shaoguan
(SG) paddy soils with or without NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> addition (500 μM
NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup>·L<sup>-1</sup> in overlying water). Before applying NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup>,
overlapping profiles were observed for the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> treatments and
control soils. The Sb profile in the SG paddy soils can be divided into
three stages: 1) high Sb (~3 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>) was observed in oxic condition
(overlying water and the top 3 mm soil); 2) Sb decreased dramatically to
low concentration (~1 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>) in reducing soils near soil water
interface; 3) Sb incraesed slowly to high concentration (~3 μg·L<sup>-1</sup>)
in deep soils. Nitrate addition significantly increased Sb concentration
in top soils (2-13 mm). The fast tranformation of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> in the top
reducing soils may explain why the influence of NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> on Sb release
is restricted in top soils. Eight days after the NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> addition, the
extra release of Sb in top soils disappears. These results indicate
NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> application in paddy soils would lead to a temporary antimony
release in soil water interface. Therefore, great care should be taken
to apply NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-1</sup> in Sb polluted paddy soils. Furthermore, more studies
are required to elucidate the correlation between Sb behaviours and N
cycling in aquatic ecosystems.

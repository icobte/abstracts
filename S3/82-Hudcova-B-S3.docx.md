<p style=text-align:justify>Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) have been proposed as effective
sorbents for Sb(V), but studies investigating sorption mechanisms
usually lack a comprehensive mechanistic/modeling approach. Moreover,
thermodynamically based surface complexation models (SCMs) describing
Sb(V) sorption on LDHs have not yet been examined and the number of
other studies dealing with the SCMs investigating Sb(V) sorption on
different solid materials is also limited. Therefore, we propose
coupling SCMs with various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques to
investigate the Sb(V) binding arrangements on the Mg-Fe LDH surface. The
Sb(V) sorption on Mg-Fe LDHs was performed at different initial Sb(V)
concentrations, ionic strengths and pH values. The removal rate
(described by pseudo-first order kinetics) and the maximal (ad)sorbed
amount (described by Langmuir model) increased with decreasing pH
values. The pH-dependent sorption data at different ionic strengths and
Sb(V) concentrations were further modeled by the diffuse layer model
(DLM) which predicted preferable formation of monodentate mononuclear
complexes on the Mg-Fe LDH surface. Spectroscopic (XRD, FTIR-ATR, XPS)
and microscopic (SEM/EDX with elemental mapping) techniques were used to
further specify the sorption mechanisms. The influence of chemical
adsorption, surface-induced precipitation of brandholzite, formation of
brandholzite-like phases and/or anion exchange was observed depending on
the Sb(V) concentrations and pH values. At lower pH values, the
negatively charged Sb(V) surface complexes adsorbed on the Mg-Fe LDH
surface provided binding sites for Mg(II) that is commonly leached from
Mg-Fe LDHs. This process resulted in the formation of individual layers
corresponding to the brandholzite-like phases. Nevertheless, the
surface-induced precipitation of crystalline brandholzite occurred only
at higher pH values. The binding of Sb(V) to both Fe(III) and Mg(II) in
the Mg-Fe LDH structure was confirmed by spectroscopic techniques
suggesting the proposed sorption mechanisms. At all pH values, Sb(V) was
nonhomogeneously distributed on the Mg-Fe LDH surface (especially on
smaller particles) showing the presence of different (ad)sorption sites,
i.e., monolayer/multilayer adsorption as well as surface-induced
precipitation. The surface complexation modeling supported by
solid-state analyses provided a strong tool to investigate the binding
arrangements of Sb(V) on the Mg-Fe LDH surface. Such a comprehensive
mechanistic/modeling approach has not previously been presented and
predicted the Sb(V) sorption behavior on Mg-Fe LDHs under different
conditions. Moreover, the presented mechanistic/modeling approach can be
useful for newly synthesized materials to evaluate their Sb(V) sorption
properties.

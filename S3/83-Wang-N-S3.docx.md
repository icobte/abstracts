<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is classified as one of the 13 priority pollutant metals
and is increasingly detected in the environment mainly due to various
mining activities and industrial applications. Sb is a non-essential
trace metal in human body and similar to arsenic (As) in chemical
properties and toxicity, however, little was known about environmental
behaviors of Sb and associated pollution cleanup. Owing to the unique
chemical properties of iron, many researches reported on the Sb removal
by chemosynthesized iron oxyhydroxides or Fe/Mn bimetal oxides, but few
was about natural particles. Secondary iron minerals (SIMs), such as
schwertmannite, jarosite and goethite, commonly occur in acid mine
drainage environments and are considered an important sink for toxic
metals. In this study, two natural sediments from the acid coal
drainage, including the newborn secondary iron mineral (n-SIM) and
mature one (m-SIM), were used to remove Sb(III/V), and the adsorption
behaviors and surface structures of Sb(III/V) on secondary iron minerals
were comprehensively investigated.

<p style=text-align:justify>The natural sediments m-SIM and n-SIM were mainly composed of Fe, O and
S, and their EDS-mapping analyses indicated that the morphologies of
m-SIM and n-SIM were dependent on the distribution of O. The results of
XRD analyses implied that both similar crystalline and amorphous iron
oxide minerals coexisted in these natural sediments. However, m-SIM and
n-SIM had different microstructures. The particle size of m-SIM was
larger than that of n-SIM, and m-SIM was spheroids with a close-packed
arrangement and regular sharp, while n-SIM had two morphologies: sea
urchin-like and pompon-like with a random loose arrangement and
non-uniform sizes. Batch experimental results showed that the effect of
solution pH on Sb(III) adsorption was more remarkable than that of Sb(V)
and the optimal pH was 7 and 3, respectively. The adsorption behavior of
Sb(III/V) on n-SIM and m-SIM were spontaneous, endothermic, controlled
by chemical adsorption and followed the monolayer Langmiur isotherm
model. m-SIM had a larger adsorption capacity to Sb(III) than Sb(V),
while n-SIM had a reverse trend but its maximum adsorption capacities of
Sb(III) (219 mg/g) and Sb(V) (366 mg/g) were higher than those of m-SIM.
The presence of Na<sup>+</sup> promoted the Sb(III/V) adsorption while Ca<sup>2+</sup>
suppressed Sb(V) adsorption on SIMs. Characterization techniques of
FTIR, Raman and XPS indicated the changes of functional groups,
elemental compositions and binding energy regions after the adsorption
of Sb(III/V) on SIMs, and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES)
analyses showed that Sb(V) was the dominant species adsorbed on SIMs.
These results revealed that the adsorption mechanism of Sb(III/V) on
SIMs involved in the electrostatic force, coordinated action, oxidation
and ion exchange reaction. This study contributes to better
understanding for Sb adsorption mechanism on natural secondary iron
minerals, and also provides potential materials for environmental
remediation.

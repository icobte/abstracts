<p style=text-align:justify>Antimony (Sb) is considered to be phytotoxic for plants. In the
environment it exists mainly in inorganic forms as antimonite
[Sb(III)] and antimonate [Sb(V)] with little organic methylated
species. Its distribution dramatic increases as a result of its rapid
growth in industrial use. Selenium (Se) is considered beneficial at low
dosage to plants as an antioxidant and it can inhibit the uptake of
various heavy metals.

<p style=text-align:justify>The aim of this study is to investigate uptake, translocation,
speciation of Sb in rice plants Se-biofortified or not, exposed to
Sb(III) and Sb(V) at increased concentrations under hydroponic
condition. At the same time, how Se influences/is influenced by the
different Sb concentrations in the distribution of organic (SeCys<sub>2</sub>,
SeMeSeCys and SeMet) and inorganic forms [Se(IV), Se(VI)] of selenium
from roots to leaves, together Malondialdehyde (MDA) content as
indicator of physiological status during plant growth. <i>Oryza sativa </i>L.
grains were chosen for the hydroponic experiments. After
Se-biofortification, at rice plants seedlings was added SbCl<sub>3</sub> and
other plants with SbCl<sub>5</sub> at 5 different dosages (0, 1, 3, 9 and 27 mg
L<sup>-1</sup>). Lyophilized and mineralized aboveground and the root samples
were analysed by ICP-MS for total Se and Sb concentrations. Other macro
elements (Ca, K, Na, Mg, Mn, Cr, Fe, Cu, As and Ni) were analysed by
ICP-OES. Speciation of Sb and Se was performed by HPLC-ICP-MS on anion
and cation exchange columns.

<p style=text-align:justify>MDA analysis on fresh materials confirm the role of antioxidant of Se at
low dosage with low results in root and aboveground. The high-dose of Se
used for biofortified roots and sprouts had significant biomass
reductions even in the absence of Sb, while the low-dose ones showed not
significantly different results from the control even in the presence of
Sb. Sb, with or without the addition of Se, was accumulated more in the
roots. Sb, present in aqueous solution such as Sb(III), was accumulated
in the roots more than the Sb present in aqueous solution such as Sb(V).
Se seemed to promote of Sb(III) store in the roots, Sb(V) showed a lower
accumulation in the Se-enriched roots. In the leaves, the effect of Se
as antagonist element of Sb was appreciable at intermediate
concentrations of Sb (3 and 9 mg L<sup>-1</sup>). Sb(V) was the predominant
specie in rice plants (79 to 93%). 9.3% of Sb(III) were found in roots
and leaves when the amount of Sb increases in hydroponic solution.
Chromatographic separation revealed the presence of unknown organic
forms of both Sb and Se. Se underwent changes in the distribution of its
chemical forms, especially organic, in the plant. Heterogeneity of the
organic forms of Se in the roots, especially SeMeSeCys and Met, were in
the plant roots at low Sb content. When the concentration of Sb
increases, the organic forms of Se decreased in the roots and increase
in the leaves, the percentages of SeMeSeCys and Met increase up to 20
and 30% of the sum of all Se species, respectively.

<p style=text-align:justify>Additional considerations may be included in the study, monitoring Sb
speciation in the medium and in short-term experiments, for the
instability of Sb(III) by isotopic dilution analysis.

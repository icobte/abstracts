<p style=text-align:justify>Heat stress seriously inhibits plant growth and development through
damage the photosynthetic components and antioxidant enzymes functions.
Salicylic acid (SA) is an important growth hormone regulator for
combating heat stress, but its roles in response to high temperature in
tomato are largely unknown. The present study was undertaken with a view
to investigate the functional along with the potentiality of SA and how
to nullify the adverse effects of heat stress (42 °C) in tomato
seedlings. Our findings revealed that supplementation of 1 mM SA
enhanced the gas exchange parameters (Pn, Gs, Ci, Tr, Ls), maximum
quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), water use efficiency, reduced
electrolyte leakage and increased the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD,
CAT, and APX) activity that helps to reduce oxidative damage through
scavenging more reactive oxygen species (ROS) which directly impacts on
plants by protecting cell membrane from damage, higher chlorophyll
content, lower accumulation of lipid peroxidation, and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.
Additionally, exogenous application of SA increased the proline content
thus added on osmotic potential which influencing plants for better
uptake of water that caused to beneficial effects on stomatal aperture
together with photosynthetic apparatus, whereas, high temperature
reduced leaf chlorophyll pigment, carotenoid content, leaf water
potential, and osmotic potential. Taken together, we concluded that the
adverse effects of heat stress could be suppressed by pretreated SA
through both in increased photosynthesis activity and antioxidant
enzymes functions.

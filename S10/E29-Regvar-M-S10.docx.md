<p style=text-align:justify>Centuries of lead mining and smelting in Žerjav, N Slovenia resulted in
elevated lead, cadmium and zinc concentrations in soil affecting plants,
wildlife and human health. The remaining local flora served as basis for
the selection of key species best suited for phytoremediation activities
as they are already adapted to prevailing environmental conditions.
Plant diversity and vegetation cover of mycorrhizal plant species by far
exceeded our expectations, indicating the importance of root fungal
colonisation for plant survival on the most polluted plots. <i>Salix
caprea</i> is the only woody shrub species present in the vicinity of lead
mine and smelter. Despite the severe metal pollution, root tips of <i>S.
caprea</i> are colonised by diverse fungal morphotypes, with the
black-coloured morphotypes being the most abundant. Element composition
and spatial distribution of selected morphotypes were analysed using
proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE). Selection of indigenous
plant-fungal symbionts is suggested as the most suitable management
strategy for phytostabilisation. Their possible role in metal tolerance
will be critically evaluated.

<p style=text-align:justify>Maize is ranked as the third most important cereal crop of the world
which was used as food and fodder for both humans and animals. Hybrid
maize cultivars worldwide replaced the traditional cultivars due to
their high yield and stress tolerance. The use of amino
acid-micronutrients in the form of chelates is recently introduced to
cope with heavy metal stress in crop plants. The present work was
planned to elaborate the effect of foliar application of Zinc-Lysine
chelate on the growth, biochemical attributes, ion balance and
rhizospheric properties of hybrid maize under cadmium stress. A pot
experiment was conducted in the green house which contains 5 kg of soil
and 80 Âµg/kg CdCl<sub>2</sub>. Two maize cultivars 3062 and 31P41 were obtained
and sown 15 plants per pot. The Zn-lys concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6 & 8
mg/L) was applied foliarly at the 2<sup>nd</sup>, 5<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> week of the
cultivation. Foliar application of the Zn-lys showed the remarkably high
growth in both maize cultivars as compared with control. Zn-lys
fertigation not only reduced Cd uptake by roots but also reduced its
translocation in shoots and leaves. It also increased the root and shoot
concentrations of ions i.e. Zn, Fe, P, N and K. Zinc-Lysine application
also significantly increased the rate of photosynthesis, enzyme
activities, plant biomass and nutritional status in both cultivars. The
MDA and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were decreased and activity of SOD, POD, ascorbic acid,
carotenoid and total protein was increased. However the Cd stress
tolerance was more prominent in 3062 as compared with 31P41 and the most
effective foliar concentration of Zn-Lys was 8 mg/L which was strongly
recommended for amelioration of Cd toxicity.

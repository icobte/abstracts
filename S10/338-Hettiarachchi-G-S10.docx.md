<p style=text-align:justify>Extensive areas of productive land can be contaminated by potentially
toxic substances due to military activities. The most common and
widespread metal contaminant in military lands is lead (Pb). Field
experiments were begun at Fort Riley, Kansas U.S.A. in 2015 with a pilot
experiment evaluating different propagules in an area with soil total Pb
concentration of about 1000 mg/kg and neutral pH. In 2016, another field
study was initiated to evaluate soil amendments and planting procedures
using a randomized complete block design with four replications. The
main objectives of these studies were to determine feasibility of using
miscanthus (a second generation biofuel crop) for phytostabilization of
this contaminated military site and to evaluate the effect of soil
amendments on miscanthus growth, soil-plant Pb transfer,
bioaccessibility of soil Pb, and soil health. Based on soil
characteristics, five treatments were selected: (i) control plots
without tillage and left with natural vegetation, (ii) no tillage, no
additional amendments and planted with miscanthus, (iii) tilled soil, no
additional amendments and planted with miscanthus, (iv) tilled soil
amended with inorganic P (triple superphosphate applied at 5:3 Pb:P
molar ratio) and planted with miscanthus, and (v) tilled soil amended
with organic P source (class B biosolids applied at 45 Mg/ha, the
organic amendment rate used by Kansas Department of Health and
Environment for other remediation plots in Kansas) and planted with
miscanthus. Soil samples were collected before planting and after each
harvest. The above-ground biomass was harvested in early December each
year, and dry matter yield was determined. Subsamples of plant material
were analyzed for nutrients and Pb. Results from the first year (2016)
showed that tilling and soil amendments increased the dry matter yield,
and that effects of soil amendments on plant Pb concentration and
bioaccessibility of soil Pb were promising. Although there were no
differences in the biomass harvested in the second year of growth
(2017), both total Pb uptake and Pb concentrations in plant tissues were
significantly lower in the miscanthus grown in plots amended with
biosolids compared to the miscanthus grown in plots with no added P.
Soil extracellular enzyme activities and relative abundances of various
nematode family groupings were also measured as soil health parameters,
and the results will be discussed. Analysis of samples from the third
year of growing season (2018) is underway.

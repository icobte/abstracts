<p style=text-align:justify>Low biomass production of metal hyperaccumulating plants is a factor
limiting the efficiency of Ni agrominning. In recent years, plant
associated-bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were tested
for their ability to improve biomass production and Ni accumulation in
plants. Another group of plant symbiotic microorganisms are endophytic
fungi. Their biggest advantage over AMF is their ability to grow on
artificial media, which facilitates the manufacture of pure inoculum
under sterile conditions and eliminates the difficulty of their
propagation. This fact is particularly important in relation to
large-scale production of inoculum.

<p style=text-align:justify>In our studies we investigated the potential role of endophytic fungi in
improving Ni accumulation of <i>Noccaea caerulescens</i>. We isolated over
200 stains of fungal endophytes from hyperaccumulators inhabiting
ultramafic soils in Europe and tested their ability to stimulate plant
growth and Ni accumulation. We also investigated the mechanism of
endophyte induced alterations in Ni accumulation. Comparing gene
expression profiles (Next Generation Sequencing) of plants that
developed the Ni accumulation phenotype with plants that were not
affected by inoculation with the fungus allowed us to select genes
potentially responsible for the development of the beneficial phenotype.
The role of the products of these genes and the mechanism of gene
expression activation in symbiotic plants is under investigation.

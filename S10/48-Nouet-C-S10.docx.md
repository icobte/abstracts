<p style=text-align:justify>Because of its rich industrial heritage, Wallonia (Belgium) has about
5,000 industrial wastelands. Among them, 3500 wastelands are polluted.
The regional government has supported for twenty years the regeneration
of polluted wastelands. The aim is threefold: to decontaminate the
wastelands, to economically redevelop areas affected by
de-industrialization and to improve the urban environment. In addition,
there is growing competition for land use for different types of crops:
food, energy and bioactive molecules. This calls for innovation to
diversify production methods on marginal soils.

<p style=text-align:justify>The aim of the ECOSOL project is to test the feasibility of producing
bioactive molecules useful for the pharmaceutical industry through
alternative systems, i.e. plants grown on industrial wasteland during
periods of underuse.

<p style=text-align:justify>Five laboratories of the University of Liège with complementary
expertise in plant adaptation, geopedology, mass spectrometry,
pharmacognosy and agronomy are involved in this project as well as the
Public Corporation to support Environmental Quality (SPAQuE) in charge
of the remediation of polluted wasteland in Wallonia. The European
Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Wallonia are funding the project
from 2016 to 2022.

<p style=text-align:justify>A wasteland called “Produits chimiques d’Auvelais» (5.5ha) has been
chosen for this case study. At this location, a chemical plant was in
operation from 1850 to 1980. The first soil analyses carried out by the
SPAQuE in 2010 showed high and heterogeneous pollution in heavy metals
and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons.

<p style=text-align:justify>The project started with an inventory of the specific flora of the
polluted wasteland. Then, before the first rehabilitation works were
carried out, the physicochemical properties of the soil and the
contaminant content were determined. Currently, the physiological and
genetic characterization of a brassicaceae species identified on the
polluted wasteland and the first field trial of candidate plants are
underway.

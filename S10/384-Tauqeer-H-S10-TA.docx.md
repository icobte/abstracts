<center><strong>Abstract</strong>

<p style=text-align:justify>Nickel (Ni) is recognized as most toxic heavy metal that prevails in the
environment through anthropogenic activities. The remediation of Ni
polluted soil is necessary. Phytoextraction is gaining attention
globally due to cost effectiveness, acceptability by the community and
high removal efficiency. Numerous organic acids have previously reported
to achieve maximum efficiency of phytoextraction. Current study was
planned to evaluate the potential of <i>Alternanthera bettzickiana</i> in Ni
contaminated soils in alone and with combination of citric acid (C.A).
Different physiological, morphological and biochemical characteristics
of <i>A. bettzickiana</i> were observed during the pot scale experiment.
Plant cuttings of <i>A. bettzickiana</i> were grown in pots filled with
5kg/pot. Nickel Nitrate [Ni(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>] was used as a source of Ni.
Different levels of Ni and citric acid were applied (Ni0, Ni5mM, Ni10mM,
C.A 2.5mM, Ni5+C.A2.5mM, Ni10+C.A2.5mM) in alone and with combination in
soil culture. Results from photosynthetic pigments, antioxidants
indicate that the application of C.A reduced metal toxicity and enhanced
plant defensive mechanism against Ni stress. Furthermore, Catalase (CAT)
and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were increased in plants with
increasing metal concentration in the media. Ni content in different
plants was in the order of leaves&gt;stem&gt;roots. Thus, we can
conclude that <i>A. bettzickiana</i> seems to be valuable for the
phytoextraction of Ni contaminated soils.

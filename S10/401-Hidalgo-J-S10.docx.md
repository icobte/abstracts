<p style=text-align:justify>Soil contamination with organic and inorganic compounds constitutes an
important environmental and human health problem worldwide. Soil
contamination with trace elements gives great cause for concern due to
their toxicity, non-biodegradable nature and potential for
bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Similarly, soil contamination with
organic compounds, especially persistent organic pollutants (POPs),
constitutes an important hazard due to their toxicity,
persistence/recalcitrance and high fat solubility.

<p style=text-align:justify>Several strategies can be used to reduce the toxic effects of soil
contaminants on humans and ecosystems. Among these strategies,
phytostabilization is a phytoremediation option focused on the reduction
of trace element bioavailability, while promoting the microbial
degradation (bioremediation) of organic contaminants in the rhizosphere.
Organic amendments are often included in phytostabilization and
bioremediation initiatives to stimulate plant growth and microbial
degradation. Likewise, the application of nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron
particles (nZVI) is also an interesting option for the treatment of
contaminated soil, especially when targeting chlorinated organic
contaminants.

<p style=text-align:justify>The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of organic
amendments (composted horse manure, sewage sludge) for the nZVI-assisted
phytostabilization of soil simultaneously contaminated with lindane (100
mg kg<sup>-1</sup> DW soil) and Zn (2500 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> DW soil) using <i>Brassica
napus</i> plants. A factorial design was used to assess the expected
beneficial effects of the organic amendments, the application of nZVI
and the growth of <i>B. napus</i> on (i) reduction of Zn bioavailability,
(ii) degradation of lindane and (iii) recovery of soil health.

<p style=text-align:justify>Among others, the following parameters were measured to quantify the
effect of treatments on soil health recovery: bioavailable Zn, total
lindane, microbial biomass C, total bacteria and fungi by qPCR,
bacterial and fungal structural diversity by amplicon sequencing (16S,
18S), potentially mineralizable N, enzyme activities (dehydrogenase,
β-glucosidase, β-glucosaminidase, arylsulphatase, xylosidase,
phosphatase, Leu-aminopeptidase), respiration, and water soluble organic
carbon.

<p style=text-align:justify>The addition of nZVI reduced the concentration of bioavailable Zn and
lindane. Microbial biomass and activity were highly stimulated in
treated soils, especially in the presence of amendments. We concluded
that the combination of <i>B. napus</i> growth, addition of organic
amendments and application of nZVI is highly promising for the
remediation of soils simultaneously contaminated with trace elements and
organic compounds.

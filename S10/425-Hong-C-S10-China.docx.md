<p style=text-align:justify>Role of non-enzymatic antioxidant, ascorbate, in alleviating Cd toxicity
was studied in a hyperaccumulator of Cd, Tagetes patula. Significantly
high levels of MDA, a biomarker of Cd induced oxidative stress leading
to lipid peroxidation, was observed in leaves and roots of T. patula
plants 8 days after exposure to concentration higher than 10 µM CdCl<sub>2</sub>.
Similarly, significantly high levels of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was observed in leaves
of 35-days-old plants exposed to 25 µM and above concentration of
CdCl<sub>2</sub> for 14 days, but no such increase in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was observed in
roots of same plants. Moreover, levels of total ascorbate (AsA)
significantly decreased and increased in leaves and roots, respectively.
In addition, root tissues were also able to maintain high levels of
reduced AsA pool as indicated by high AsA/DHA ratio. However, AsA/DHA
ratios were similar across leaves of untreated and Cd treated plants.
Presence of 1 mM AsA in media during Cd toxicity (25 µM CdCl<sub>2</sub>)
abolished the chlorosis phenotype of plants observed under Cd stress and
photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) was similar to that of control
non-stressed plants. The improved oxidative stress tolerance in above
ground tissue can be observed by the significant increase in total AsA
level in leaves compared to Cd stressed plants. Enhanced oxidative
tolerance of plants in presence of 1 mM AsA during Cd stress helped in
maintaining significantly higher shoot biomass than Cd stressed plants
though significantly lower than that of control untreated non-stressed
plants. The increase in shoot biomass translated in higher accumulation
of Cd in above ground tissue under Cd stress. The results indicate that
the growth of <i>T. patula</i> plants as well as Cd accumulation can be
improved under Cd stress by enhancing the ascorbate pool in above ground
tissue.

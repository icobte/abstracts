<p style=text-align:justify>The use of fast-growing trees producing a high quantity of biomass can
bring significant practical and economic benefits to the reclamation of
marginal lands. The present study aims to identify new tree species to
offer a wider range of trees useful for phytomanagement practices. We
implemented three experimental sites in France of 1 ha each (Thann,
Carrières-sous-Poissy and Leforest) contaminated by different
potentially toxic elements (PTE) with a total of 38 different tree
species. The 3 sites were divided into 8 different plots. In order to
improve plant remediative capacities, 4 of the 8 plots were inoculated
with a commercial mycorrhizal inoculum (Rhizophagus irregulare DAOM
197198 strain). In this study, microbial community structure on
rhyzobial soils were analysed using metabarcoding approach
(IlluminaMiSeq). Both 16S and ITs primers were used to amplified
bacteria and fungi present on each of the three sites and for each of
the 38 tree species. Fungal analyse results show that fungi communities
are specific of the plant species. For instance, <i>Salix aquatica
grandis</i> (a common species for the three sites), previously demonstrated
to accumulate high concentration of TE in aboveground biomass, showed no
significant difference depending on the site. However, significant
dissimilarities were exhibited for <i>Pterocarya stenoptera</i> and <i>Ostrya
carpinofolia</i> (the other 2 common species for the three sites), trees
with phytostabilisation capacity. Moreover, this study showed that some
tree species contribute to change the fungal community in soil if
compared to the control soil. On this regard, Carrières control soil
were composed by 30% of Mortierellales, 40% of Hypocreales and 30% of 11
other fungi, while, e.g., rhyzobial soil of <i>Salix aquatica grandis</i>
presented a very different fungal composition, with a higher proportion
of Agaricales (60%). In opposition, bacterial communities exhibited no
significant difference depending the tree species neither compared to
the control soil. Furthermore, bacterial composition was different from
one site to another, demonstrating that soil physic-chemical
characteristics play a crucial role in microbial community. Additional
details about microbial community structure will be further discussed in
the presentation.

<p style=text-align:justify>Agromining aims to rehabilitate natural metal-rich soils (ultramafic
soils) by extracting metals of high economic importance, such as nickel
(Ni), using hyperaccumulator plants and then to recover these metals for
industrial purposes. Ultramafic soils are characterized by low fertility
levels and this can limit yields of hyperaccumulators and metal. Here,
we characterized the potential benefits for phytoextraction efficiency
of co-cropping two plants: a Ni-hyperaccumulator (<i>Odontarrhena
chalcidica</i>; <i>Brassicaceae</i>) and a legume (<i>Vicia sativa</i>; <i>Fabaceae</i>).
A two years field experiment was set up in an ultramafic zone (North
West Spain). Three treatments were tested: co-cropping (CoC), fertilized
control with ammonitrate of the hyperaccumulator (FCon) and
non-fertilized control (NFCon). Over the two years, FCon and CoC
treatments had significantly higher yield values (plant biomass and Ni)
compared to NFCon. Indeed, after two years of cultivation, CoC had
increased <i>O. chalcidica</i>’s biomass by 24% compared to FCon treatment.
Moreover, CoC had higher Ni-yields than FCon for the first (7.8 <i>vs</i> 5.8
kg ha<sup>-1</sup>) and the second year (13.6 <i>vs</i> 9.9 kg ha<sup>–1</sup>). A Principal
Component Analysis (PCA), based on the microbiological and
physico-chemical soil parameters measured each year, showed that all
treatments of the second year cultivation were negatively correlated
with soil bioavailable Ni concentration (Ni-DTPA) and phosphatase
microbial activity. Moreover, FCon was characterized by negative
correlations with almost all microbial and physico-chemical soil
parameters. A non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS) of the
operational taxonomic units (OTUs) showed that soil bacterial diversity
of the first year treatments was clearly separated from that of the
second year. Moreover, after two years of cultivation, CoC increased the
relative abundance of the phylum <i>Gemmatimonadetes</i> when compared to
other treatments, while relative abundances of <i>γ-Proteobacteria</i> were
significantly reduced over time for all the treatments. Multivariate
regression tree (MRT) provided a tree with three terminal nodes based on
exchangeable Ni (Niex) and soil organic carbon (Corg). Niex was the most
influencing parameter on the phyla’s relative abundance with all samples
collected during the first year characterized by low Niex levels (&lt;
1.18 mg kg<sup>–1</sup>) and separated from those of the second year with higher
Niex. Concerning samples from the first year, Corg was identified as the
second major environmental factor and separated CoC (Corg &gt; 3.18 g
kg<sup>–1</sup>) from others treatments (Corg &lt; 3.18 g kg<sup>–1</sup>). Based on the
predicted metagenomes, genes belonging to different families were
identified depending on the treatments. This study showed that
co-cropping a hyperaccumulator with a legume in agronomic systems
dedicated to Ni-agromining improved plant biomass production and
Ni-yields as in the case of fertilized control, but co-cropping less
impacted some microbial soil parameters. Ameliorating agromining by
replacing mineral fertilizers would combine eco-efficient or sustainable
metal recovery.

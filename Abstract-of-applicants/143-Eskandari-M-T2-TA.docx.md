<center><strong>Abstract</strong>

<p style="text-align:justify">About 45% of pistachio yield convert to the pistachio waste compost
(PWC) after harvesting. Returning of it to the soil, in addition to
reducing environmental contamination, increases the soil organic matter
and it can affect the uptake of nutrients in pistachio seedlings in
saline conditions. In this experiment, PWC at three levels (0, 10 and 15
Kg) and soil containing spores of mycorrizal fungi at three levels (0,
100 and 200 g) was studied with three replications (each replicate
included four seedlings) on <i>Akbari</i> and <i>Badami Zarand</i> cultivars
pistachio as a split-plot in RCBD in Khorasan Razavi province – Iran,
2017. The results showed that iron, manganese and zinc concentration
were affected by pistachio cultivars, so that the most concentration of
iron (166.4 ppm) and manganese (60.7 ppm) were observed in <i>Akbari</i> and
zinc (32.07 ppm) was also detected in the <i>Badami Zarand</i> cultivar. The
maximum concentration of iron and manganese under interaction effects of
cultivar and PWC was seen in <i>Akbari</i> and 15 and 10 kg of pistachio
waste compost, respectively. The most amounts of potassium, iron and
manganese was obtained in the treatment of 200 g of fungi with <i>Akbari</i>
cultivar. In comparison with other treatments, the interactions of
<i>Akbari</i> with 15 kg of PWC in 200 g mycorrhiza had the highest effect on
the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium with 2.1%, 0.12% and
1.72%, respectively. Also, <i>Akbari</i> cultivar with 200 g of mycorrhiza
and 10 kg of PWC had the maximum effect on the leaf concentration of
iron, manganese and zinc. The average amount of some elements in
mycorrhizal treatments was more than the non-inoculated; as, it was
observed 0.64 and 0.118% for phosphorus average, then iron with 152 and
86.3 ppm, and finally manganese with 53 and 18.6 ppm for mycorrhizal and
non mycorrhizal treatments. But, the results were revealed that the
combination of three species of <i>Glomus mossea</i>, <i>Glomus intrardices</i>
and <i>Glomus etunicatum</i> was not efficient due to competition among the
species of fungi and other native soil microorganisms. The mean value of
all nutrients in PWC treatments was higher than the non-consumption. The
highest difference was observed for average of zinc with 31.1 and 15.6
ppm, phosphorus (0.118% and 0.083%), and potassium (1.3 and 0.91%).
Results indicated that the amount of PWC should be more than 15 kg per
seedling to have a more effective influence on the concentration of
nutrients in the plant in the water (12.7 dS m<sup>-1</sup>) and soil (10.02 dS
m<sup>-1</sup>) salinity and their relatively alkaline pH (7.8).

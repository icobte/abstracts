<p style="text-align:justify"><i>Arabidopsis arenosa</i> is closely related to <i>Arabidopsis halleri,</i> which
is a model plant species used to study the adaptation to environments
highly contaminated with trace metal elements (TME). Tolerance to Cd and
Zn has only been largely studied in <i>A. halleri</i> , while in <i>A. arenosa</i> 
is neglected. In this study, we compared the impact of high Cd or Zn
doses on the photosynthetic apparatus of two <i>A. arenosa</i> and <i>A.
halleri</i> ecotypes growing on the same contaminated site in southern
Poland. Plants were grown in hydroponic culture during six weeks, and
then treated with 1.0 mM Cd or 5.0 mM Zn for 5 days. Chlorophyll <i>a</i> 
fast fluorescence transients and pigment content were measured after 0,
24, 48, 84 and 120 h of treatment. In both species, exposure to TME
excess caused a decrease in chlorophyll and an increase in anthocyanin
contents in leaves compared with control conditions. The maximum quantum
efficiency of the PSII (φP<sub>0</sub>) was significantly lower after 84 h Cd
treatment in <i>A. halleri</i> and after 120 h in <i>A. arenosa</i>. Zn treatment
significantly lowered φP<sub>0</sub> in <i>A. halleri</i> after 120 h, while it had
no impact in <i>A. arenosa</i>. After 5 d Cd treatment, the energy
absorbance, electron transport flux and the percentage of active
reaction centres decreased more in <i>A. arenosa</i> than in <i>A. halleri</i>.
However, the electron transport flux was less affected in than in the
second species. Zn treatment had comparatively less toxic effect than Cd
excess on <i>A. halleri</i> and it caused only a decrease in the electron
transport flux. On the other hand, <i>A. arenosa</i> plants treated with Zn
excess reacted as strongly as with Cd and all energy fluxes
significantly decreased. The two species showed contrasting behaviour in
TME accumulation. <i>A. arenosa</i> accumulated almost three times more Cd in
shoots than <i>A. halleri</i>. On the opposite, three-fold higher Zn
concentration was measured in <i>A. halleri</i> leaves compared to
<i>A. arenosa</i>. Our results supported hyper-tolerance of both species to
high Cd or Zn doses. However, the photosynthetic apparatus of two
metallicolous tested ecotypes responded differently to the TME
treatments. Our research can improve knowledge on TME tolerance and
accumulation in plants, and this may help improving biofortification and
phytoremediation strategies.

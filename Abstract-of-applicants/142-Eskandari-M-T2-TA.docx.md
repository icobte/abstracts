<p style="text-align:justify">Application of sulphate reducing bacteria to remove toxic metal
contaminants from environment is considered a cost-effective and
valuable method. The purpose of this study was halophilic bacterial
reduction of sulphate to remove iron and sulphate from very saline
synthetic wastewater under anaerobic conditions to convert it to a
chemical fertilizer for use in saline and alkaline soils. From samples
collected from wastewater of cotton delinting factory, halophilic
sulphate-reducing bacteria were enriched with lactate and sulphate in
basal medium (Postage C) supplemented with 10% NaCl and 1% MgCl<sub>2</sub>.6H2O.
Three strains were isolated and maintained in pure culture. Strain HSR
973 which showed the highest NaCl tolerance (up to 10%) consisted of
motile non-sporulating vibrioid cells and resembled the genus
<i>Desulfovibrio</i>. However, on the basis of physiological differences to
all described species of this genus, strain HSR 973 was described as a
new species and named <i>Desulfovibrio halophilus</i>, sp. nov. This
experimental study was conducted in a biological reactor at anaerobic
conditions. The iron was introduced into reactor at 50 to 400 ppm. The
rate of sulphate reduction and iron removal were studied at retention
times of 24 hours or more. All parameters in 50 ml samples were analysed
using the standard methods for experiments of water and wastewater.
After the adaptation of bacteria at different concentrations of iron,
the maximum iron and sulphate removal at the optimum retention time of
24 hours were recorded 85.35 % and 78.3 %, respectively. Sulphate
concentration in samples decreased to less than 20% after 24 h retention
time. The maximum production of H<sub>2</sub>S at optimum operational conditions
was about 228 ml/l. The results showed that the reduction of sulphate
and iron biological precipitation by this method is acceptable.
Alkalinity generated during the process can facilitate the system for
treatment of acidic wastewater containing iron sulphate. The produced
iron sulphide sludge was not suitable for use as a chemical fertilizer
due to its lack of complete separation. However, the total sludge
produced was able to be consumed in saline and alkaline soils for
various purposes, including of pistachios growing in this area.

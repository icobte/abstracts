<p style="text-align:justify">The ecological functions of microorganisms (e.g. mineralization of
organic matter, nitrogen cycle, soil aggregation, <i>etc</i>…) modify soil
properties and elements availability. They play a crucial role in
nutrient uptake, making microorganisms important drivers for plant
development and ecological successions. Many soil parameters can drive
the adaptability or acclimation of soil living organisms like plants or
bacterias. Micro-organisms adaptation is a fast process according to
their short life cycle and their ability to host plasmids which can be
transferred to other community members. As a drastic selective factor,
high metallic soil content may promote strong and site specific
micro-organisms evolution. In addition, a few studies suggested that
bacteria may decrease the accumulation of toxic trace metals by plants,
thereby improving plant development on highly contaminated soils. This
is highly valuable for phytostabilization approaches, whose goal is to
stimulate the development of a self-sustainable plant cover on polluted
sites, in order to limit pollutant release and transfer to the
environment.

<p style="text-align:justify">However, to our knowledge, no specific bacterial strains are currently
commercially available for phytostabilization purposes. In this respect,
we performed additional studies on a phytostabilization field experiment
onto metallurgical slags, to: i) document the mid-term natural response
of microbial populations to the various forcing conditions and ii)
identifying slag-compatible Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria (PGPB) which
could help plants to grow in this extreme environment.

<p style="text-align:justify">The study site is a metallurgical dump heavily contaminated with various
metals (e.g. Cr, Zn, Cu, V, Ni, Mo, W, Al) near Rive-de-Gier, France. We
took advantage of the phytostabilization experiments performed <i>in-situ</i>
since 2010 within the ANR-PHYSAFIMM project. These field experiments
were aimed at testing various amendments (ramial chipped wood, composted
sewage sludge and N/P/K mineral fertilization) and plant assemblages
("regular", "metallophyte", no seeding) onto a slag substrate. Eight
years after, the experimental plots show contrasting plant covers,
suggesting that different communities of microorganisms could be present
from one tested condition to another. Metals tolerance and other
functional traits (e.g. phosphorus solubilizators, organic acid,
siderophorus and/or IAA producers) were assessed on strains isolated
from rhizospheric soils belonging to three plant species grown on three
differently amended phytostabilization parcels.

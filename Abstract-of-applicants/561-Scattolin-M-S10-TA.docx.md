<p style=text-align:justify>Steel slags are major by-products of the steel and iron industry.
Particularly rich in metal trace elements, these materials are massively
stored in slagheaps and can constitute potential nuisance for the
environment and public health. Several studies have shown the
effectiveness of phytostabilization processes for rehabilitating sites
contaminated by high levels of metals, both because of their sustainable
and ecological aspects but also due to their low implementation costs.
However, implementing a phytostabilization project for metallurgical
slags is a challenging issue. Besides the potential toxicity of metal
elements (e.g. Cr, Zn, Cu, V, Ni, Mo, W, Al), slags are almost devoid of
organic matter and major nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. They
also have a very low water holding capacity (sandy texture), as well as
a high pH (&gt;10) that greatly reduces the phytoavailability of
essential micronutrients (e.g. Fe, Cu, Zn).

<p style=text-align:justify>The slagheap studied located near Rive-de-Gier (France) contains
approximately 500 000 tons of slags spread over an area of about 4 ha. A
previous study carried out on the same site has demonstrated that the
use of "Composted Sewage Sludge" (CSS) as an organic amendment favors
the installation of metallophytes herbaceous species naturally able to
grow on this type of substrate. Recent studies have also demonstrated
the benefits of using AMF (Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi) isolates for
the phytostabilization of metal polluted soils and alkaline mine spoils.
In this work, we evaluated the combined effects of CSS and AMF
inoculation on: i) the soil pore water composition and metals
bioavailability and ii) the vegetation in terms of biomass production as
well as accumulation of trace metals in leaves. Results showed that AMF
inoculation led to root colonization and improved P uptake. We also
observed that the CSS amendment has a critical role on plant growth by
changing the fluid pH (from 10.5 to 8.5) and thus, the speciation of Al
in the system. Indeed, geochemical modelling run with the PhreeqC
program revealed that Al becomes soluble, and therefore toxic for plant
development, at a pH higher than 9.

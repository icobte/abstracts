<p style="text-align:justify">Salinity stress is one of the important abiotic stresses that decrease
crop growth and yield. The Potassium to Sodium ratio is considered as an
appropriate criterion for determining the salinity tolerant genotypes of
barley. This research was carried out in order to study of agronomical
and physiological traits in three Iranian Barley genotypes under farm
salinity stress and also comparison of expression patterns of the genes
involved in salinity tolerance of sensitive and tolerant barley
genotypes at reproductive stage. Three cultivars and promising lines of
barely (Afzal cultivar as tolerant genotype, L527 as sensitive genotype
and inbred line MBS87-15 which was the result of crosses between Afzal
and L527, as a tolerant genotype) were planted in a completely
randomized block design in 3 replications under 2 different environments
(salt stress and normal condition) during 2015-2016 in Agricultural and
Natural Research Station of Neishabour, Iran (latitude 36°14´N,
longitude 58°46´E, altitude 1,320m). Salt stress experiment was
irrigated by NaCl solution with an electrical conductivity of 12 ds
m<sup>-1</sup>. Salt stress led to significant decrease in seed yield, K<sup>+</sup>
concentration and K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio while increased in Na<sup>+</sup>
concentration, prolin and froctan content, catalase and ascorbate
peroxidase enzymes activity. Results indicated that tolerant genotypes
Afzal and MBS87-15 had lower Na<sup>+</sup> concentrations with higher K<sup>+</sup>
concentrations and K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio in flag leaf blade compared to salt
sensitive cultivar L527. Under salinity stress, seed yield was
positively correlated with K<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> ratio and K<sup>+</sup> concentration.
Increasing the expression of SOS1 gene in old leaves of Afzal and
MBS87-15 cultivars indicates that the two genotypes are well suited for
the exclusion of sodium mechanism in the old leaf that acts as a salt
reservoir. In the flag leaf of genotypes, the expression of SOS1 gene
was decreased. It is likely that in the flag leaf, where the sodium
concentration is much lower than that of the old leaves, Barley plant
uses sodium ion as cheap osmolite for osmotic regulation. The results
showed that NHX1 gene plays an important role in the compartment of
Na<sup>+</sup> in vacuole, so that in the flag leaf of Afzal cultivar, the
expression of this gene increased, but no change was observed in two
other genotypes. Also, in old leaves of Afzal and MBS87-15 cultivar,
this gene was expressed more intensely than the L52. The expression
pattern of the SOD gene in the MBS87-15 was similar to L527 parent.
While the expression pattern of Dehydro ascorbate reductase and glycine
de-carboxylase genes in Afzal and MBS87-15 cultivars were similar.
Generally, the results indicated that two genotypes of Afzal and
MBS87-15 compared to the L527 genotype, exploited osmotic regulation (
compatible osmolites), Na<sup>+</sup> exclusion and antioxidant defense
mechanisms better than L527 genotype. So, it seems that, salinity
tolerance mechanisms mentioned above have excellently been inherited
from Afzal to MBS87-15 and after several generation selections for
salinity tolerance, these mechanisms were stabilized in MBS87-15
genotype.

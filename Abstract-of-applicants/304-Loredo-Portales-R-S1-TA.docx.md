<p style=text-align:justify>The mining activity in Mexico is intense, particularly in the northwest,
where the production of Au and Cu is 33 and 84 % of the total national.
The Arizona-Sonora region is characterized by the presence of three
metallogenetic belts of Au, Cu, and Au-Ag deposits. Therefore, the
presence of historic and low volume artisanal mine tailings is commonly
found along this area, near to human settlements and river basins.
Mexican regulations for mining waste are becoming more severe but the
abandoned mine waste like tailings are almost ignored. It is well known
that, mine tailings are a source of PTEs, and acts spreading this
element constantly to the environment in some cases for long time
scales. According to the EPA, in USA and the INEC in Mexico, the most
important contaminants includes: Sb, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Ag, Pb,
Se, Tl and Zn.

<p style=text-align:justify>Since the availability and toxicity of PTEs are strongly correlated to
their chemical speciation, synchrotron techniques have become key tools
for studying the biogeochemistry of PTEs in environmental matrixes such
as plants, water and soils at atomic and molecular level. The principal
techniques are μ-XRF (imaging & tomography), μ-XAS (chemical speciation
and structure) and μ-FTIR, (interaction with organic molecules). In this
work we use a combination of wet chemistry and synchrotron techniques in
two sites polluted by mining activities, with the aim to improve the
knowledge on the biogeochemistry of the most relevant PTEs present in
the study site and determine if they represent a potential threat to the
environment and human health. One of the oldest polluted sites affected
by As and Pb, presents a naturally attenuation, since soluble fractions
of As are low (&lt;10%), and also its presence in plants tissues (0.4%)
and soils (2.6%) around, compared with mine tailings content (&gt;12,500
mg Kg<sup>-1</sup>). Our results showed that the presence of arsenates like
kankite (FeAsO<sub>4</sub>∙3.5H<sub>2</sub>O), can moderate As availability, by adsorption
and lixiviation resistance. Lead spreading at the same site, is
controlled by dissolution of minor phases presents at the mine tailings
like beudantite (PbFe<sub>3</sub>(AsO<sub>4</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>) (OH)<sub>6</sub>) structure. A previously
analysis at the second site, showed that Mn content is high at mine
tailings (&gt;54100 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and changes its oxidation state (+2 to
+3) trough soil profile and distance from the source at agricultural
soils. Mn biological function and toxicity depends on its oxidation
state (II and III), the comprehension of its biogeochemical behaviour is
necessary to improve the risk assessment and remediation technologies to
be used at this and other sites. Further analysis will include their
spatial variation as a function of chemical speciation and availability
to improve the risk assessment and the use of soil for agricultural and
human activities.

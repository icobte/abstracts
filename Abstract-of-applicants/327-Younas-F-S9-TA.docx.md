<p style="text-align:justify">Contamination of soils, surface water and groundwater environments with
toxic elements by the addition of industrial effluents is a global
environmental and public health concern. A great risk is posed to our
natural water resources from a widespread leather tanning industry,
owing to the heavy use of chromium (Cr) salts during the tanning
process. Two major forms of chromium (Cr), trivalent Cr (Cr(III)) and
hexavalent Cr (Cr(VI)), are predominantly found in tannery industry
wastewater. Chromium(VI) is the most toxic form of Cr which does not
have any essential metabolic functions in the living organisms. We aimed
to determine the total Cr and its species in wastewater samples
collected from several tanneries in district Kasur of Punjab, Pakistan.
All the tannery wastewater samples (<i>n</i> = 86) showed elevated total Cr
concentration (range: 1-185 mg L<sup>−1</sup>; mean: 16 mg L<sup>−1</sup>; SD: ± 34 mg
L<sup>−1</sup>). The concentration of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) ranged from BDL to 17 mg
L<sup>−1</sup> and BDL to 174 mg L<sup>−1</sup>, respectively. The Cr(VI) concentration in
most of the wastewater samples exceeded the National Environmental
Quality Standard (NEQS; 0.25 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) and the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA; 0.1 mg L<sup>−1</sup>) safe limits in
wastewater. The physicochemical parameters of the tannery wastewater
(pH, alkalinity, acidity, TDS, Cl, sulfate) were found to be higher than
their safe limits for wastewater. Our data indicate that the wastewater
of these tanneries is a potential threat to the surface water, soil and
groundwater, and hence some suitable remediation strategies are needed
to treat Cr-contaminated tannery wastewater, such as employing a
constructed wetland technology.

<p style=text-align:justify>Quantitative understanding of kinetics and mechanisms heavy metal
adsorption-desorption and transport processes, batch and stirred-flow
experiments were carried out with vanadium (V) and molybdenum (Mo) on
soils at different reaction conditions and time scale. Batch experiments
indicated that adsorption of V and Mo on soils were highly nonlinear and
time-dependent, where V and Mo retention showed typical biphasic
reaction kinetics. The stirred-flow experiments showed that both V and
Mo adsorption consisted of a fast initial reaction, as indicated by the
fact that effluent solute concentration was close to zero for the first
few minutes. A stirred-flow multi-reaction model (MRM) which accounts
for slow as well as fast reactions of the reversible and irreversible
type was developed to describe V and Mo adsorption and desorption
processes on soils. Based on model simulations and experimental tracer
breakthrough curves (BTCs) results, we concluded that the proposed model
is valid for stirred-flow conditions. The strong retardation and slow
release behaviors of V and Mo from stirred-flow experiments were
successfully described using the proposed stirred-flow MRM where
retardation and irreversible reactions were necessary. Our work provide
a general stirred-flow model which is capable of describing reactive and
non-reactive solutes.

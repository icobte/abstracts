<p style="text-align:justify">Organic forms of mercury are recognized as persistent and highly toxic
chemicals. Soil microbiota is an important player in assurance of soil
functioning (nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, pollutants
degradation, etc.). Hg methylation by soil microbiota plays a
significant role in Hg global biogeochemical cycle and it should be
considered. Generally, microorganisms are exposed mainly to bioavailable
Hg in soil solution and fungi, but could be also through decomposing
dead organic matter. At moment remained poorly understood the
consequence on soil microbiota of exposure at different levels and forms
of organic Hg. We presume that microbiota community structure and
abundance could be changed as a consequence of exposure at organic forms
of Hg, which in turn could alter soil functioning. In this study we used
soil samples from a historically polluted site (Turda, Romania) with Hg,
to assess Hg organic forms and their impact on soil microbiota community
structure. To test our hypothesis, we performed also soil column
experiments under controlled conditions (humidity, light exposure, etc.)
and methylmercury exposure levels (5, 10, 25 and 50 µg⋅kg<sup>-1</sup>,
respectively). PLFA approach was used to assess microbiota community
structure and abundance. Enzymatic activities related with C
(CM-cellulase, invertase) and N (urease, protease) cycling were assessed
also, as key functions of soil. We found that organic forms of Hg
influence the microbiota community structure. Soil column experiments
revealed that bacteria groups and abundance were negatively related to
methylmercury amounts. Correlation between methyl mercury and monitored
soil enzymatic activities were as follows: CM-cellulase 0.38, invertase
0.42, urease -0.79, protease -0.86, (p &lt; 0.05).

<p style="text-align:justify">These results provide a starting point for subsequent studies to
investigate effects of organic forms of mercury on soil microbial
community structure. Continued advancement in this area will allow for a
more detailed understandings of methylmercury effects on microbiota and
on soil functioning which will aid in understanding Hg organic forms
effects on overall soil ecosystem health.

<p style=text-align:justify>Healthy food production is imperative for human health. However, many
wetland soils are polluted with toxic elements such as arsenic, cadmium,
mercury, antimony and others. In particular, paddy soil are very
vulnerable since they serve as producer of food, including rice. Paddy
soils are regularly flooded and thus, they underlie large fluctuations
of redox conditions. Those changes of redox conditions have considerable
impacts on the biogeochemical behavior of toxic elements as well as on
pH, carbonate, and carbon solubility, chemistry of iron, manganese, and
sulfur as well as on microbial community, which control the mobilization
of toxic elements. Doubtless, the redox potential and pH are master
variables in governing those mobilization processes. We are able to
conduct experiment in the laboratory to study mechanistically the
release dynamics of toxic elements. Also, we are seek for suitable
amendments to stabilize those toxic metals in the soil which should be
stabile even under dynamic redox conditions. Biochar is considered as
one option to fulfill this purpose. Various results gained at several
scales (microscale, laboratory and field scale) will be presented.

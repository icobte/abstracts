<p style=text-align:justify>Cd pollution of soils becomes a global environmental issue, binging in
increasing damage to food safety and human health. Biochar can retain
metal ions via surface complexation, adsorption, electrostatic
interaction etc, and is considered as cost-efficient soil amendment for
Cd contamination. However, with the change of environmental factors like
pH and water condition, metal ions adsorbed on biochars may be released.
In this study, a thiol-modified biochar(T-RSBC) was prepared in order to
strengthen the metal retention capacity of rice straw biochar, since the
thiol group could form the stable complex with metal ions (like Hg<sup>2+</sup>
and Cd<sup>2+</sup>). And the Cd adsorption capacity of T-RSBC was investigated
in the batch experiment and soil reactor experiment. Results indicated
that the total S content of T-RSBC was increased from 0.98%(RSBC) to
24.0%, and the content of available thiol group tested by Ellman method
was increased to 0.80 mmol/g. In addition, the results of FTIR, SEM-EDS
and XPS were also confirmed the successful loading of thiol group onto
RSBC. The adsorption of Cd<sup>2+</sup> ion onto T-RSBC reached equilibrium
within 6 hours. In the pH 5 buffer solution system, the saturated
adsorption capacity of Cd ion of T-RSBC was 48.1 mg/g, which was 5.7
folds as that of RSBC. After amended into soils, the concentrations of
DPTA extracted Cd of soils were significantly decreased to 60.8% - 65.2%
in the T-RSBC treatments, which were lower than those in the RSBC
treatments (80.0% - 96.3%). In addition, the TCLP extracted Cd of soils
were decreased to 82.1% - 86.3% of that in the control treament. The
results of Tessier sequential extraction indicated the amendment of
T-RSBC decreased the content of carbonate bonding Cd in soils, and
increased the contents of Fe-Mn (hydro)oxide bonding- and organic
bonding Cd in soils, which lead to the decrease of mobility and
bioavailability of Cd. In conclusion, the loading of thiol group onto
rice straw biochar increased the interaction between Cd<sup>2+</sup> ion and
biochar, and improved the remediation of Cd pollution of soils. Our
study developed a novel thiol-modified rice straw biochar as soil
amendment for cadmium pollution, which provided scientific support for
the remediation of soil contamination.

<p style=text-align:justify>Adsorption is a commonly used method to treat groundwater contaminated
with trace elements (TE). A lot of low-cost adsorbents from agricultural
waste, industrial by-products and natural and modified materials are
being developed and applied to contaminated water. However, seldom spent
sorbent is safely handled afterwards and often end up in landfill, thus
creating new problems and posing new risks to humans and environment. To
overcome this issue, pre-treatment of spent sorbents prior final deposit
might be necessary. As an alternative to traditional thermal methods,
e.g. combustion or pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) opens
possibility to treat wet waste streams, without the need for an
energy-intensive drying before or during the process.

<p style=text-align:justify>Hydrothermal carbonization is a wet, relatively low temperature (180-350
°C) process where, under autogenous pressures, biomass undergo a chain
of reactions, including hydrolysis, dehydration, decarboxylation,
condensation polymerization, and aromatization. Recently, HTC has
received attention as a method for producing low-cost carbon-based
nano-compounds used for fertilization, soil amelioration, and carbon
sequestration in soil. However, application of HTC for complex waste
streams, such as spent sorbents, is little explored. Basic published
trends show that major part of inorganics remain with the hydrochar, but
in general, behaviour of compounds, like TE, during the HTC is largely
unknown.

<p style=text-align:justify>The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of using HTC as a
treatment method for spent iron-peat sorbents, highly enriched with TE.
Physical, chemical and thermal properties of the hydrochar were
evaluated after the HTC treatment.

<p style=text-align:justify>Spent iron-peat sorbent with high loads of arsenic (As) (1 g kg<sup>-1</sup>),
chromium (Cr), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) (up to 4 g kg<sup>-1</sup>) was
hydrolysed at 230 °C (420 PSI) for three hours. Determination of the
major elements, calorific value, and sequential extraction were
performed with the obtained hydrochar. While dissolved carbon, density,
and total elemental composition were analysed for the aqueous phase.

<p style=text-align:justify>The calorific value of the hydrochars increased by at least 30% as
compared to HTC-untreated spent sorbent. Obtained hydrochar showed
similar calorific value of coal. More than 99% of total adsorbed Cr, Cu
and Zn remained in the hydrochar but nearly 30% of As was transferred to
aqueous phase. Dissolved organic content substantially increased in the
aqueous phase because of a high content of degradation products such as
sugars, organic acids, and aromatics.

<p style=text-align:justify>Hydrothermal carbonization as a treatment method for spent sorbents with
high TE loads is promising. However, environmental and practical
implications associated with the evolved gases and composition of the
aqueous phase needs further investigation.

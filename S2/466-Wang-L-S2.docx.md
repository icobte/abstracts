<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium(Cd) removal by biological approaches using bacteria has received
a great interest as it is environmental friendly and cheap. Furthermore,
biochar could provide carbon sources and shelter bacteria
from toxicant such as high Cd concentration in aqueous
or soil. In comparison with raw biochar, bacteria loaded biochar could
increased the absorption ability of Cd without new pollutants
introduction. Therefore, three kinds of biochar, one derived from rice
straw (RB), one from pig manure (PB), and another derived form rice
straw loaded by Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (magnetic biochar, MB), were used as the
carriers and co-sorbent of a bacteria (K1) to absorb Cd in aqueous
solution and soil. MB+K1 showed better capability in decrease of Cd in
solution. In soil, MB+K1 also showed best effect and decreased soil
available Cd from 370 ppb to 25 ppb, compared with the MB decreased to 80
ppb. Co-application of K1 also eased the acid effect of magnetic biochar
and increased soil pH to 7. BCR fraction analysis indicated that K1
decreased the acid-soluble Cd fraction. Furthermore, MB could decrease
both acid-soluble and reducible fraction and increase the residual
fraction.

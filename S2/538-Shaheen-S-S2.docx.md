<p style=text-align:justify>There is a lack of knowledge on the effects of biochar (BC) on the
release dynamics of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in different
phases of soil under systematic change of redox potential (E<sub>H</sub>). We
aimed to elucidate the impact of pre-definite E<sub>H</sub> on the release
dynamics of dissolved and colloidal concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cu,
Mo, Ni, and Zn as well as their phytoavailability and potential mobility
in the solid-phase of a mining soil treated with rice hull biochar
(S+BC) compared to non-treated soil (S). The influence of E<sub>H</sub>-dependent
changes of soil pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved aromatic
carbon (DAC), Fe, Mn, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and Cl<sup>-</sup> on the elements release was
also determined. The experiment was conducted stepwise from reducing
(-30 mV in S and -12 mV in S+BC) to oxidizing (+218 mV in S and +333 mV
in S+BC) conditions using an automated biogeochemical microcosm system.
Biochar-treated soil exhibited a wider range of E<sub>H</sub> and a lower pH than
the non-treated soil.

<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium and Co was more abundant in the colloidal fraction, while As,
Cu, Mn, Mo, and DOC were more abundant in the dissolved fraction.
Nickel, Zn, and Fe distributed almost equally in both fractions.
Dissolved concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Zn, Fe, Mn, SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>,
and DAC increased under oxic conditions in the non-treated and
biochar-treated-soil, which might be due to the oxidation of the
elements to a more soluble species, decline of pH, and/or sulfide
oxidation. Biochar increased the dissolved concentration of As, Cd, Co,
Cu, Ni, and Zn, in particular Cu under oxic conditions. However, the
biochar did not significantly affect the colloidal fraction of Cd, Co,
Cu, Ni, and Zn. The phytoavailability of the studied elements was higher
than the potential mobility. We conclude that increasing the dissolved
concentrations of the elements under oxic conditions might increase
their release and transfer into the groundwater and the food chain which
should be harmful for the environment. Application of such rice hull
biochar to this soil might increase the metal release under oxic
conditions, which might increase the environmental and health risks in
such wetland ecosystems.

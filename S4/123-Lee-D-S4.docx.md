<p style=text-align:justify>The problem of arsenic (As)-contaminated rice affects the food safety
and human health, therefore, it received more concerns in recent years
around the world. Previous research indicated that increasing
concentration of silicic acid in soil solutions may mitigate As uptake
by rice. However, some studies also found that silicic acid can desorb
arsenite (iAs<sup>III</sup>) from soil solid phase and lead to an increase in As
uptake by rice. Therefore, further clarification of comprehensive
effects of silicic acid applied on paddy field is necessary. Two rice
(<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) cultivars including TK9 (japonica) and TCS 10
(indica) commonly planted in Taiwan were used in this study, which were
grown in two As-contaminated paddy fields located at Minsyong (Ms) and
Guandu Plain (Gd), Taiwan, where soil As concentration are 20-110 mg/kg
and 100-240 mg/kg, respectively. Based on recommended application rate
of 750 kg SiO<sub>2</sub> ha<sup>-1</sup>, there are four calcium silicate application
rates: 0 kg (Si0), 750 kg (Si1), 1500 kg (Si2), 3000kg (Si4) SiO<sub>2</sub>
ha<sup>-1</sup> used in this study. The results show that the As concentration in
brown rice of TK9 and TCS10 cultivars grown in Gd field were decreased
about 15% and 20% after Si application, respectively, which decreased by
2-7% and had no significant difference in Ms soils. In addition, it was
observed that the main As species in brown rice was iAs<sup>III</sup> and DMA,
and the proportion of iAs<sup>III</sup> was higher than DMA. Moreover, it was
also found that the As concentration in shoot were significantly reduced
after Si application, and the extents of decrease in As concentrations
of shoot in Gd field was higher than Ms field. The results of growth
index show the shoot biomass and grain yield of two tested rice
cultivars grown in Gd field under Si treatments were decreased, which
may be resulted from As phytotoxicity. However, there was no significant
growth inhibition was observed in Ms field. Based on the above results,
it suggests the Si application can reduce the As (inorganic As)
accumulation in brown rice, the extents of decrease were controlled by
the soil properties, As concentrations and rice cultivars. Therefore, it
needs to consider these factors when Si fertilizer is applied to
As-contaminated paddy soils.

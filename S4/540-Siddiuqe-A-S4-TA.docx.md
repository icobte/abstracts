<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) is one of most mobile and potentially bioavailable soil
elements that poses risk to human even in low concentration. The worldâ€™s
first documented incidence of mass poisoning by Cd, the <i>Itai-Itai</i>
disease in Japan, brought global public attention to the problem of
Cd-contaminated rice. For this reason, bioaccumulation of Cd in rice
grain is a major agricultural concern, particularly in Asian countries
where people ingest rice two to three times per day. Many agricultural
soils are contaminated with Cd due to anthropogenic inputs such as
smelting, fossil fuel burning, and application of sewage sludge and
phosphate fertilizer. Traditional remediation technologies that focus on
soil washing or excavation and transport of farmed soils to prescribed
landfills is not practicable with the management of agricultural soils
exposed to Cd. For this reason, a risk based approach, that minimizes Cd
uptake by plants in upland soils is often practiced in most countries.
In this study, we have investigated the potential role of iron plaque
formation in paddy soils on soil solution Cd dynamics and uptake by rice
plant. Two soils (pH values 4.6 and 6.6) collected from the rice growing
region (Griffith) of Australia were chosen for this study. Rice was
grown as per traditional practice such as under continuous flooding
conditions. Two Australian local rice cultivars (Quest and Langi) were
used. Three levels of Cd (0, 1 and 3 mg Cd kg<sup>-1</sup> soil) and three levels
of Fe (0, 50 and 100 mg Fe kg<sup>-1</sup> soil) were spiked in soil. The
experiments were carried out in the pot under glasshouse conditions with
three replication. Rhizon sampler were installed in the pot before the
rice transplanted and soil pore water were collected with Rhizon sampler
at different growth stages of rice plant (10, 30, 60, and 110 days of
transplanting). The samples were analyzed for Fe and Cd using ICP-OES
and ICP-MS, respectively. The results showed that Cd concentration in
soil pore water gradually decreased with growing period of paddy rice.
Comparison among the data of four time points (Day 10, 30, 60 and 110)
demonstrated that pore water Cd concentration was the highest at the
initial sampling period (day 10) and reached to the lowest values at day
110. The Cd concentration in pore water increased greatly with
application of Fe @50mg/L and this trend of increment was declined at
higher dose of Fe (100mg/L) application. Further investigations with
increasing concentrations of Cd and Fe are required to determine the
effect of Fe to reduce the Cd level in rice grain.

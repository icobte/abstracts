<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) accumulation in rice grains threatens the health of over
150 million people in the world. Although management options including
alternative wetting and drying or upland rice farming are effective
approaches to reduce As uptake and accumulation, rice yield penalty is a
big concern. Continuous flooding enhances rice production that is
crucial for a growing global population, but enhances As
bioavailability. The dilemma requires new insights and transformative
approaches to control the As speciation and uptake in rice paddies. An
emerging trend in the U.S. water bodies is the gradually increasing
nitrate and perchlorate levels. Both chemicals are strong oxidants which
can potentially oxidize As in the absence of molecular oxygen (e.g.
under flooded irrigation) and consequently alter As speciation. We
conducted a greenhouse study including three treatments with addition of
nitrate only (10 mg/L NaNO<sub>3</sub>), perchlorate only (50 µg/L NaClO<sub>4</sub>), or
mixed nitrate and perchlorate (10 mg/L NaNO<sub>3</sub>+ 50 µg/L NaClO<sub>4</sub>) as
well as one control treatment (no nitrate and perchlorate) throughout
the life cycle of rice. The results showed that the presence of nitrate
or perchlorate increased the rice grain yield compared to the control
treatment, although larger standard deviation was observed in the
perchlorate treatment (six replicates). The mixed nitrate and
perchlorate treatment also increased the rice grain yield, but the
increase was more moderate. The total As was lower in all treatments
with nitrate and/or perchlorate compared with the control, with the
perchlorate alone treatment caused most reduction. As speciation
analysis in plant tissues suggested that the altered As uptake was
caused by the modified As speciation by the co-existing oxidizing
agents. Organic As was dominant As species in rice grains, especially
di-methylarsinic acid (DMA), accounting 66-76% of total As, while
inorganic As was predominant in rice straws and roots in all the
treatments. In summary, the presence of nitrate and perchlortae in
irrigation water significantly decreased the As uptake and accumulation
while enhancing the rice yield, which indicates the application of
continuous flooding with oxidizing compounds as a sustainable As
management strategy.

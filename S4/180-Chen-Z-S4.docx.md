<p style=text-align:justify>Soil arsenic (As) contamination is a worldwide concern, and many methods
have been applied to remediate arsenic contaminated soil. Despite iron
oxides nanoparticles have been successfully used to immobilize arsenic
in soil, the transformation and distribution of arsenic species in soil
at presence of iron oxide nanoparticles are still limitations,
practically in As (III) and As (V). Hence, in this study, firstly, iron
oxide nanoparticles synthesized using <i>euphorbia cochinchinensis</i> leaves
extract (GION) were used to immobilize total arsenic in a contaminated soil. Results indicated that the
As were immobilized effectively in GION treatments. After 30, 60 and
120d incubation, the available (0.05 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> extractable) As
decreased by 14.3%, 25% and 50%, respectively. The availability of As
decreased significantly after 30, 60 and 120d incubation. Secondly, As
species distribution is understood. The results indicated that As(V) was
the main valence state in five soil fractions after long time
incubation. Additionally, soil samples were characterized using
characterization techniques. The result of X-ray fluorescence
spectroscopic (XRF) showed that the Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> increase significantly in
9% GION treatment, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) showed that
As(V)-O was the dominant valence state in the 0.05 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>
extractable and residual fraction, whereas only As(III)-O was detected
in the 0.2 M NH<sub>4</sub>-oxalate extractable fraction in both control and GION
treatments. However, in contrast to the control, As(V)-O decreased
significantly (p&lt;0.05) in the GION treatment. Overall, As in
contaminated soil can be effectively immobilized
by GION and the efficiency increased with incubation time. Finally, the
result also indicated GION may cause the variation in As species, which
should be further studied.

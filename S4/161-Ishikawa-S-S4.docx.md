<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) is dispersed in natural and agricultural environments
through human activities and natural occurrence. Japanese arable lands,
especially paddy fields, are contaminated to some extent by Cd through
irrigation with river water originating from mines or through emission
from metal-smelters. Rice is a staple crop in
Japan and is a major source for dietary intake of Cd. In addition,
soybean or wheat is often used as a rotation crop or a secondary crop,
respectively, in paddy fields; therefore Cd concentrations of soybean
and wheat should also be taken care of as well as rice.
The rice Nramp5 is well known to mediate Cd
and manganese (Mn) uptake in the root and the knockout line greatly
reduces Cd concentration in the grains. In a recent study, the Cd
transport activity in TaNramp5A and 5D from hexaploid wheat was
investigated. In this study, we examined if the Nramp5 orthologs in
soybean and two types of wheat, i.e., tetraploid and hexaploid wheat,
have ability for Cd and Mn transport.

<p style=text-align:justify>To examine the effects of Cd on Mn uptake in the plants, the seedlings
of rice, soybean, and wheat were treated for 3 days with different
levels of Cd (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5, 1 mg Cd/L) in nutrient solution and
the Cd and Mn concentrations of plants were determined by ICP-MS or
ICP-OES after acid-digestion. The full-length ORF of <i>Nramp5</i> in rice
(<i>OsNramp5<i>), soybean (<i>GmNramp5</i>), tetraploid wheat (<i>TdNramp5A</i> and
<i>TdNramp5B</i>), and hexaploid wheat (<i>TaNramp5A</i>, <i>TaNramp5B,</i> and
<i>TaNramp5D</i>) was cloned by PCR and sequenced. For subcellular
localization analysis, confocal microscopy of rice protoplasts
transiently producing the Nramp5 orthologs fused with green fluorescence
protein (GFP) was performed. The two yeast mutants, Cd-sensitive <i>Δycf1</i>
and Mn uptake-defective <i>Δsmf1</i>, were used to analyze Cd and Mn
transport activities of Nramp5 orthologs.

<p style=text-align:justify>Metal analysis showed that the Cd concentrations of shoots and roots in
all plant species were increased in dose-depending manner, but the Mn
concentrations remarkably decreased with increasing Cd levels,
indicating antagonistic interaction between Cd and Mn uptake by roots in
plant species tested. The cDNA sequences between <i>TdNramp5B</i> and
<i>TaNramp5B</i> matched perfectively. High identity of more than 80% was
found between rice and wheat in amino acid sequence of Nramp5. Amino
acid sequence of OsNramp5 and GmNramp5 shared 69% identity. Confocal
microscopy of rice protoplasts expressing GFP-fused proteins
demonstrated that the all Nramp5 orthologs are localized at the plasma
membrane. The growth of <i>Δycf1</i> cells expressing <i>OsNramp5</i> or
<i>GmNramp5</i> was strongly impaired by Cd, whereas all Nramp5 homologs in
wheat did not affect the growth. The growth of <i>Δsmf1</i> was improved by
the expression of <i>OsNramp5</i> or <i>GmNramp5</i>, whereas was not by all
<i>Nramp5</i> homologs in wheat. These results suggest high or low ability
for Cd and Mn transport through GmNramp5 or Nramp5 homologs in wheat,
respectively.

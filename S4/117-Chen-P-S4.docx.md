<p style=text-align:justify>Contamination of cadmium (Cd) in paddy soil is a serious environmental
problem threatening food safety in some parts of southern China, where
rice grain Cd concentration often exceeds the Chinese limit (0.2 mg
kg<sup>-1</sup>). Many field studies have shown a poor relationship between rice
grain Cd concentration and soil total Cd concentration and other soil
properties. One of the reasons is that the bioavailability of Cd in
paddy soil is strongly influenced by the soil redox potential,
especially during the grain filling stage. To investigate this effect,
we conducted field experiments in a paddy field contaminated with a
moderate level of Cd (total soil Cd 2.6 mg kg<sup>-1</sup>, pH 5.8) in Xiangtan,
Hunan province in 2017 and 2018. The paddy soil surface was prepared in
a slight slope (5 cm) along the 20 m length from the irrigation inlet to
the outlet. This slope created a gradient of soil water content and
hence, the redox potential, when paddy water was drained during the
grain filling period. Soil Eh, pH, and dissolved Cd concentration were
monitored during the rice growing season. During the grain filling stage
when paddy water was drained from the outlet, soil Eh ranged from -200
to -100 mV in the outlet area to 100 â€“ 200 in the inlet area, whilst
soil pH varied from 6.2 to 6.7. At maturity, grain Cd concentration
showed a distinct spatial pattern, increasing from low levels in the
outlet area to high levels in the inlet area, with a difference of 5
fold. To test if the gradient in soil Cd bioavailability generated from
differential redox potential along the slope was caused by the
drainage-induced variation in soil pH, we applied lime (4.5 t ha<sup>-1</sup>
CaCO<sub>3</sub>) to one of the two adjacent field slopes. Liming increased soil
pH the initial 5.8 to 6.5. In the unlimed control, rice grain Cd
concentration showed the same gradient of 6-fold variation. In contrast,
grain Cd concentrations in the limed slope were generally very low and
showed no clear spatial pattern. Our results show that variation in the
paddy water status during the grain filling can cause a large variation
in grain Cd concentration, and this effect is attributed mainly to soil
pH changes associated with the variation in the redox potential. To
decrease grain Cd concentration, paddy field should be maintained
flooded as late as possible during grain filling or that paddy soil
should be limed to pH above 6.5.

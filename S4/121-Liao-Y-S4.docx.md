<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) is considered as one of the most dangerous carcinogens in
natural environment. In recent research, it has been reported that the
extents of As accumulated in plants related to the plant species, soil
characteristics and climate. Compared with paddy rice, the mechanism of
the As uptake by upland crop is still unclear. In general, vegetables
are grown in upland field which availablility of As in soil is low, so
it is not easy to accumulate As in plants. However, due to water spinach
can be planted in both flooding and upland field, which may cause the
differences in As accumulation in plants between these two water
managements. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to compare
the distribution of As species and total As concentration in water
spinach grown in As-contaminated soils with different water managements
(flooding and upland conditions). In this study, two tested soils
collected from Guandu(Gd) and Minsyong(Ms), which soil texture are clay
and silt loam, respectively. The As concentration in Gd soils are 21 mg
As kg<sup>−1</sup>(GdL) and 139 mg As kg<sup>−1</sup>(GdH), and those in Ms soils are 38
mg As kg<sup>−1</sup>(MsL) and 100 mg As kg<sup>−1</sup>(MsH). Besides, the contents of
organic matter and free iron (Fe) oxide (DCB extractable) in Gd soils
are higher than in Ms soils. The results showed that the arsenite
(iAs<sup>lll</sup>) was the dominant species in the soil pore water under two
water managements, while the proportion of arsenate (iAs<sup>V</sup>) in the
upland field was slightly increased. Due to the higher contents of free
Fe oxides in Gd soils, the amounts of Fe plaque on the root surface and
biomass of the water spinach grown in Gd soils are higher than Ms soils.
The results of plant analysis showed that the As concentration in plants
grown in GdH soil was higher than other tested soils, and it also
indicated the As concentrations in roots were higher than shoots.
Inorganic As was the predominant species in water spinach, while the
main As species in roots is iAs<sup>lll</sup>, and the aboveground part is
iAs<sup>V</sup>. In addition, it was found that the proportion of iAs<sup>V</sup> in
plants grown in soil with upland condition was higher than flooding
condition. Based on the results of this study, it suggests the As
species in water spinach is highly related to those in soil pore water,
and the As accumulation in edible parts are significantly decreased
under upland condition.

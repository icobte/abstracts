<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) and cadmium (Cd) in soil are solubilized and immobilized
under contrasting redox conditions. Tradeoff relationships have been
recognized between dissolved As and Cd in soil, and between As and Cd in
rice grains. Recent studies, however, have suggested the possibility of
simultaneous suppression of As and Cd concentrations in rice grains by
appropriate water management strategies. A key notion underlying the
strategies is that dissolved As is rapidly immobilized once the
air-filled porosity of soil exceeds a threshold value upon drainage,
whereas solubilization of Cd is a slower process which continues after
the completion of As immobilization. This leads to a hypothesis that by
conducting intermittent irrigations with an appropriate drained period,
dissolved As and Cd concentrations are simultaneously kept at low
levels, resulting in suppression of their uptake by rice plants. The
objective of this study was to find an optimal intermittent irrigation
interval for reducing rice grain As while minimizing the increase in
rice grain Cd. The study was comprised of Field Experiments I and II,
both of which examined the effects of intermittent irrigation during
preheading 3 weeks and postheading 3 weeks on dissolved as well as rice
grain As and Cd concentrations. In Field Experiment I conducted in four
fields, intermittent irrigations with different irrigation intervals
(4–10 days) were compared. Intermittent irrigations with a drained
period of 3 days or longer substantially lowered dissolved As
concentration in soil during postharvest 3 weeks, which was critical to
rice grain As. Intermittent irrigation repeating 3-day flooding and
4-day drainage was capable of achieving acceptably low levels of rice
grain As and Cd concentrations simultaneously. In Field Experiment II,
feasibility of this intermittent irrigation strategy with 3-day flooding
and 4-day drainage was further tested at 21 sites for two years. On
average, rice grain inorganic As concentration was lowered by 38%
relative to the continuous flooding at sites where the latter exceeded
0.2 mg kg<sup>−1</sup>. Adverse effects on rice grain Cd, grain yield and quality
were minimized in most cases. Further field experiments are in progress
to develop a more versatile water management strategy to reduce rice
grain As and Cd concentrations.

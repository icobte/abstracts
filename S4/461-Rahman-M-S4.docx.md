<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) is recognized as a toxic element and has been classified as
a human carcinogen (group I) causing skin and lungs and bladder cancers.
Currently, groundwater of 107 countries are affected by As contamination
released from predominantly geological sources, posing a serious health
hazard to an estimated 150 million people worldwide. Arsenic exposure to
humans mainly occurs via drinking As-contaminated water and Food crops
grown in As-contaminated areas. Besides drinking water, groundwater is
also used for irrigating crops during the dry season, particularly for
paddy rice (Oryza sativa). Rice and vegetables are the main foods of
population in Bengal delta. Transfer of As from groundwater into crops
has been well documented. Arsenic in rice is an important issue as about
3 billion people around the world consume rice as staple food. In this
study, we have investigated the geographical variation, cancer risks for
adults due to the consumption of rice and how to reduce As from paddy
rice using water management options.

<p style=text-align:justify>For this study, we collected and analyzed 965 rice samples from 20
districts of Bangladesh. Districts were selected based on the As
concentrations (severely, moderately and less affected) in groundwater.
Digestion of the rice samples for total As analysis was carried out as
per standard protocol. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer
(ICP-MS) was used to determine the amount of total As. Two water
management options such as continuous flooding (CF) and alternative wet
and dry (AWD) were used to see the variation of As uptake in 10 rice
cultivars.

<p style=text-align:justify>The analytical results showed that As concentration in rice grain varied
from 3-680 µg/kg (dry weight). Arsenic levels in rice are dominated by
the location and variety. Dietary exposure to inorganic As from rice
poses potentially serious risks (both carcinogenic and
non-carcinogenic). Daily intake of inorganic As from rice ranged between
0.38 and 1.92 μg/kg BW. The female groups are more susceptible than male
groups while the 2–5 and 6–10 age groups are supposed to be more exposed
to As from rice consumption.

<p style=text-align:justify>The results from water management study showed that significant yield
difference among the cultivars under CF and AWD irrigation. The AWD
irrigation significantly increased grain yields for around 38% over CF.
The variety with the highest yield was Binadhan-8 (7.0 t/ha) followed by
Binadhan-6 and BRRI dhan58 (6.8 t/ha). The As levels in rice grains
under AWD and CF irrigation conditions ranged from 147–348 µg/kg and
182-431 µg/kg, respectively. Overall, 9 to 39% difference in grain As
concentration between the CF and AWD practices among the rice cultivars.
Speciation of grain As were found not to differ among the varieties in
respect to inorganic As around 88 to 99%.

<p style=text-align:justify>Expansion of industrialization causes unexpected release of various
contaminants into ecosystem, and especially heavy metals pose a threat
to environment and human health even with low concentrations. In the
present study, we isolated and characterized Cd-tolerant indigenous
bacteria from paddy soil around a coal-fired power plant in Korea for potential applicability to
remediation. The studied soil contained Cd of 6.0~8.8 mg/kg after aqua
regia digestion which is above Korean soil quality criteria. The 16S
rRNA sequencing for two indigenous bacteria, G17-1 and G17-2, isolated
under the condition of 100 mg/L of Cd revealed that they belonged to
<i>Enterobacter ludwigii</i> and <i>Escherichia vulneris</i>, respectively. They
appeared to have high minimum inhibitory concentrations for Cd (2,500
and 2,250 mg/L, respectively) which are higher than the other bacteria
previously reported. Experiments of Cd biosorption with the two bacteria
were conducted using living and dead bacteria. Dead bacteria were
prepared using autoclave. When 100 mg/L of Cd was applied at pH 6.8,
living G17-1 and G17-2 reduced 51.1% and 41.2% of dissolved Cd,
respectively. However, dead bacteria showed 33.7% and 35.8% of Cd
removal efficiency, respectively. Input of 300 mg/L of Cd led to lower
biosorption capacity than 100 mg/L for both bacteria. The results
indicated that the studied <i>Enterobacter ludwigii</i> has high potential of
being employed in bioremediation of Cd-contaminated water. Using the
isolated strains, applicability to and tolerance against other heavy
metals such as Pb, Cu, Ni and Zn will be investigated for further study.

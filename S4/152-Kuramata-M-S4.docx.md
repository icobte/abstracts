<p style=text-align:justify>Cadmium (Cd) contamination in rice is concerned as a potential health
risk for humans because rice is a major source of Cd intake from foods.
Therefore, it is necessary to develop a rice cultivar with low Cd
uptake. We previously found rice mutants showing low Cd uptake from a
rice mutant library developed by carbon ion beam irradiation method.
Previous results indicated that the defective OsNramp5 transporter
greatly reduces Cd concentration in rice grains. However, because
OsNramp5 is a major transporter for manganese (Mn), Mn concentration in
mutants was decreased as well. On the other hand, iron (Fe)
concentration in straw of the mutant was 1.5 - 2 times higher than that
of the original rice cultivar (WT) when they were cultivated under
continuously submerged conditions, while the Fe concentration of grains
in the mutant was not significantly increased.

<p style=text-align:justify>To investigate the molecular mechanisms on the increased Fe level in
straws for rice mutants with defective OsNramp5, we performed a
microarray analysis using root samples of rice seedlings grown in
hydroponic culture. The analysis showed that expression levels of
several genes involving in Fe transport were significantly upregulated
in the mutant compared to the WT. Because the transcript levels of
OsIRO2, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15 and OsTOM2 were increased in the mutant,
it was speculated that Strategy II mechanisms of chelation-based Fe
uptake were activated. Thus, OsNramp5 mutation enhanced the expression
levels of genes involved in Fe transport independent of Fe deficiency.
According to the study by Inoue et al. (2009), OsYSL15 gene expression
is not induced by Mn deficiency. Thus, we guess that such enhanced gene
expression could not be due to the reduced Mn uptake in OsNramp5
defective mutants.

<p style=text-align:justify>Further investigation would be needed to elucidate the mechanisms on the
changes in Fe transport metabolism in the OsNrmap5 defective rice
mutant.

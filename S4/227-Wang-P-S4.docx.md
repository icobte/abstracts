<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As), a class 1 carcinogen is widely distributed in the
environment. Since rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i>) takes up As in the form of
arsenite (As(III)) in paddy field through highly expressed Si
transporters Lsi1 and Lsi2, it is able to accumulate higher As in the
grains compared with other cereal crops. As a result, rice is a major
dietary source of inorganic As for the populations consuming rice as the
staple food. Therefore, it is a very important issue for human health to
reduce the As accumulation in rice grains. To identify genes controlling
As accumulation in rice, we first investigated the genotypic difference
in shoot As accumulation in 134 core collection rice varieties. By using
hydroponic solution containing 1 ÂµM As(III), we found that shoot As
concentration ranged from 11 to 41 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> dry weight depending on
cultivars after exposure for 6 days. Furthermore, <i>indica</i> cultivars
accumulated significantly lower As in the shoots than <i>japonica</i>
cultivars. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we used one F<sub>2</sub>
population and one chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL)
population to map the responsible genes. The F<sub>2</sub> population was derived
from a cross between an <i>indica</i> cultivar (lower As concentration) and
an <i>japonica</i> cultivar (higher As concentration). By using the F<sub>2</sub>
population, one major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for shoot As
accumulation was detected on chromosome 10. This QTL explained 20-30% of
total As variation. A QTL located at the same region was also detected
by using the CSSL population derived from Muha (<i>indica</i> cultivar, low
As) and Koshihikari (<i>japonica</i> cultivar, high As). In addition, another
QTL on chromosome 6 was also mapped for shoot As concentration in this
CSSL population. Fine mapping of these QTL genes is being undertaken by
using high generation populations in future.

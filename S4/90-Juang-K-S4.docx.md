<p style=text-align:justify>Paddy rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) is a staple crop in most East and
Southeast Asian countries. However, across Asia, cadmium (Cd) has
increasingly accumulated in paddy soil owing to the use of phosphate
fertilizers and the release of industrial effluents into irrigation
channels that are used for flooding paddy fields. The food safety risk
posed by increasing Cd levels in rice is of great concern. Information
about the genotypic variations of Cd tolerance, distribution, and
accumulation in rice plants is essential for selecting and breeding more
rice cultivars to reduce Cd in human diets. At present, variations in
the Cd levels in rice plants and accumulation in rice grains are still
not considered during rice breeding in Taiwan. A physiological
understanding of genotypic variations in Cd contents in rice grains
would be useful for better selecting or breeding low Cd-accumulation
rice genotypes. The present study aims to investigate Cd absorption and
toxicity in different rice cultivars and to clarify their relationship
with the physiological response to Cd stress. This study conducted a
hydroponic experiment to investigate rice genotypic variations in Cd
absorption and toxicity related to plant physiological traits. Eight
paddy rice cultivars were selected based on the criteria of rice grains
quality in Taiwan. These rice cultivars were of three different types:
<i>japonica</i> (TY3, TK9, TNG71, and KH145 cultivars), <i>indica</i> (TCS10 and
TCS17 cultivars), and glutinous (TKW1 and TKW3 cultivars). Uniformly
grown seedlings were drawn up for Cd treatment with 50 µM CdCl<sub>2</sub> in
hydroponics for 7 days; a check was set at 0 µM CdCl<sub>2</sub>. In results, the
reductions of shoot growth were more significant than those of root
growth for the rice cultivars with Cd treatment. However, absorbed Cd
was preferentially accumulated in the root than in the shoot. This
suggested that less Cd transfer from the root to the shoot would be
related to higher Cd tolerance and shoot growth improvement. The
oxidative statuses of rice plant under Cd stress depended on the
configurations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in the root and shoot and the oxidative
damages of Cd stress were determined by the malondialdehyde (MDA)
contents in plant. The results showed more enhanced MDA by Cd treatment
in the root than in the shoot. This consisted with that the superoxide
dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities were more
pronounced in the shoot than in the root. The regulation tendencies of
SOD and APX were also related to the Cd preferential accumulation in the
root. Therefore, the root would play a role in protecting the shoot from
oxidative damages of Cd stress for rice plants.

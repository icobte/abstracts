<p style=text-align:justify>Zinc and cadmium are two of the most common heavy metals found at
contaminated sites, with the main sources being anthropogenic activities
as mining and smelting operations. When a highly contaminated soil
becomes flooded, a number of chemical reactions may occur and define if
the metals will be retained or released. The aims of this study was to
evaluate the potential release and discuss the mechanisms that regulate
Zn and Cd solubility in two mining soils under flooding conditions,
using chemical extractions, mesocosm experiments and simple geochemical
modelling. Mine-affected soil samples were collected in the mining basin
of Gorno (Lombardia Region, northern Italy). Zinc-lead sulphides
deposits have been mined in this area since Roman times and, at
intervals, until now. Following a previous characterization study, we
collected two representative soil samples contaminated by Zn (65 - 112
g/kg), Cd (160 - 360 mg/kg), Cu and Pb. In particular, Zn and Cd levels
were several times higher than the limits established by Italian
legislation. The waterlogging of the soils resulted in two somehow
different behaviours regarding the metal contents in pore water. In Soil
1, Mn levels in the soil solution increased gradually while in Soil 2
the Mn reduction started immediately after flooding. In this second
case, Fe was also slowly reduced and solubilized after the 5th week of
the experiment. Total contents of Zn in both soils increased slightlyin
the first week of flooding, decreasing almost linearly after the second
week until the end of the experiment. In the case of Cd, the two soils
behaved differently. In Soil 1, the soluble concentration decreased
gradually over time while in Soil 2 a small peak of release appeared
during the first days of the experiment followed by a sharp decrease
until zero concentration after 28 days of experiment. The geochemical
modelling predicted both metals precipitating in Soil 1 as Zn and Cd
carbonate and no sulphide precipitation was calculated due to the
relatively high Eh in the soil solution. Clays and Fe oxides seem not to
have a great influence on the concentrations in the soil solution as
both metals are preferentially complexed by SOM. In Soil 2, metals precipitate as Zn and Cd carbonate during the first
days while sulphides are formed after 60 days of submersion. In this
case, Fe oxides seem to adsorb slightly Zn but not Cd while both metals
are preferentially complexed by SOM.

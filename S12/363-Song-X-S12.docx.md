<p style=text-align:justify>Efficient injection and distribution of nanoparticles in porous media
are considered a formidable technical hurdle for injection-based in situ
remediation. One approach to enhance the mobility of nano-particles in
an aquifer is to use surface modifiers. In this study, nanoscale
magnesia (NMgOs), an innovative and effective remedial material for
cadmium (Cd) removal from groundwater, was modified with the negatively
charged and eco-friendly humic acid to enhance its mobility in aquifers.
A two- dimensional reactor (605010 cm), with 2 injection wells and 30
monitoring wells was designed, constructed, and sand-packed in the
laboratory to simulate a saturated aquifer. The simulated aquifer was
pre-contaminated with Cd to simulate a plume in groundwater. The
distribution of injected un- modified NMgOs and humic acid-modified
NMgOs slurry were evaluated in the reactor. The radius of influence
(ROI) of humic acid-modified NMgOs was estimated to be approximately 5
cm based on visual observation, while no ROI was apparent for the
unmodified NMgOs because of their aggregation at the bottom of the
injection wells. The concentrations of Cd and magnesium (Mg) were
monitored in all 30 monitoring wells at different time intervals to
evaluate the effectiveness of Cd removal. The break- through curve
analysis revealed that humic acid enhances the transport of NMgOs in the
saturated porous media. Furthermore, the results of scanning electron
microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray (SEM-EDX) characterization of silica
sand before and after injection of NMgOs verified the presence of 5.78%
of Mg from humic acid-modified NMgOs and 0.19% from unmodified NMgOs at
35 cm downgradient of the injection wells, which are consistent with the
conclusion drawn from the breakthrough curves.

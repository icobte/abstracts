<p style=text-align:justify>Arsenic (As) is a class I toxic metal(loid) and classified as a human
carcinogen. Arsenic contamination in soil has become a major
environmental problem worldwide. Many As polluted sites have been
reported around the world due to anthropogenic activities, especially
mining and smelting operations. In Australia, extremely elevated levels
of As have been associated with mine impacted soils, cattle dip sites
and railway corridors. Abandoned mining sites are often in close
proximity to agricultural land and sensitive ecological areas, such as
National Parks. Thus, soil As mobility and bioavailability needs to be
managed to reduce offsite migration and potential impacts to proximal
receptors. <i>In situ</i> remediation of As contaminated soils is
increasingly sought after, yet there are limited options available which
are not highly sensitive to changing redox conditions. In this study, we
have investigated the efficacy of zirconium (IV) to immobilize As in
soil. Twelve As contaminated soils were collected from abandoned mine
sites from different areas of Australia. The total As concentration in
these soils ranged from 8.3 to 94,000 (median 490) µg/g. Soils were
treated using either Milli-Q water or zirconyl chloride solution (soil :
solution = 1 : 5) and allowed to react for 6 h. Following the adsorption
step, the pH was adjusted to approximately 7 using 0.1 M NaOH, thus
precipitating ZrO on the surface of soil colloids. Soils were then
equilibrated (10mM NaNO<sub>3</sub>) for 24 h, soil suspensions centrifuged,
filtered (0.22 µm pore size) and analysed for As by inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). All analyses were performed in
duplicate. Arsenic extractability in untreated soils ranged from 0.9 to
347.8 (median 5.4) µg/g whereas ZrO treated soils ranged from 0.06 to
73.97 (median 0.17) µg/g. The results revealed that ZrO immobilization
efficiency of As from polluted samples ranged from 79 to 93%, depending
on the soil characteristics. In conclusion, ZrO shows potential for <i>in
situ immobilization</i> of As in As contaminated soils. Further research is
currently under way to investigate the use of mixed-metal composite
frameworks and long-term efficacy in contaminated soils.

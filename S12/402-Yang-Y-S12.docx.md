<p style=text-align:justify>Due to low hydraulic conductivity and cost-effectiveness, the
soil-bentonite (SB) slurry trench cutoff walls have been widely adopted
in the US, Canada and Japan to control transport of contaminated
groundwater at landfill and industrial sites. Traditional SB backfill is
consisted of trench spoils or proper imported soils, water, and sodium
bentonite (Na-bentonite) with bentonite content ranging from ~1% to
about 6%. However, using low swelling calcium bentonite (Ca-bentonite)
is extremely meaningful for countries where high-quality Na-bentonite is
scarce while Ca-bentonite is plentiful. Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP)
has been manifested as an effective amendment for improving workability
and hydraulic performances of the Ca-bentonite in SB backfill. However,
by date the hydraulic conductivity response of the SB backfill
containing SHMP-amended Ca-bentonite to aggressive chemical solutions
has not been addressed. This study presented lab-scale investigation of
hydraulic conductivity of SB backfill composed of 80% sand and 20%
SHMP-amended Ca-bentonite (dry weight basis) in potassium dichromate
(K<sub>2</sub>Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>7</sub>) solution with 19.2 mM (1000 mg/L) Cr(VI) concentration.
Duplicated flexible-wall hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted
using tap water first and followed by the Cr(VI) solution. The volume,
pH and electrical conductivity of the inflow and outflow liquids were
monitored, and Cr(VI) concentrations in the outflow liquid were
measured. The variation in hydraulic conductivity with the pore volume
of flow of permeant liquid was assessed. The results show that the
hydraulic conductivity maintained a value lower than the commonly used
value of 10<sup>-9</sup> m/s regardless of the type of permeant liquid,
indicating that Cr(VI) solution had insignificant adverse effects during
the tested period. Overall, the results obtained in this study can
facilitate the application of SHMP-amended sand/Ca-bentonite backfills
for containment of Cr(VI) impacted groundwater.

<p style=text-align:justify>The Lead Pathway Air Study (2007-2012) on the human exposure to lead was
undertaken at Mount Isa, Queensland, Australia. Mount Isa Mines is located west
of the city and mined and processed lead-zinc and copper ores since the 1930s.
The Australian health risk assessment framework was followed using
bioavailability and bioaccessibility tests and other measurements. Human
exposure to lead is from ingestion of ≤250 µm sized particles via the digestive
system and inhalation of <10 µm sized particles into lungs; absorption via skin
is insignificant. This paper considers the relationship of lead speciation data
and bioaccessibility/bioavailability with characteristics of mine waste and
environment samples for human health risk assessment. Sampling provided
physico-chemical characteristics together with high resolution lead isotope
measurements and other techniques (XRD, SEM and particle size analysis).
Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) using x-ray absorption
near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) recorded lead LIII-edge spectra at BL 20B, Photon
Factory,Tsukuba, Japan. Lead speciation/composition in the recorded spectra of
over 300 samples were fitted using linear combination fitting (LCF) of sample
spectra against up to 20 model compounds. Bioaccessibility (BAc) was measured
using the Physiologically Based Extraction Test (PBET) to simulate the
gastrointestinal tract of pH 1.3, 2.5 and 4.0 for fasting, partially fed and fed
stomach conditions respectively, and pH 7.0 for the small intestine. Predicted
bioaccessibility from XANES spectra LCF with model Pb compounds showed no
significant difference from measured BAc (p >0.05). Lead BAc in all mine wastes
was 32±21% (mean ± sd; n=82) compared with 24±12% (mean ± sd; n=99) in
surrounding city garden soil; only a small proportion of lead was available for
absorption. A significant correlation (r<sup>2</sup>=0.656, n=12) showed that BAc can be
used to predict bioavailability, calculated from bioaccessibility of 10
representative data sets and based on the upper 95 per cent confidence interval
level for slope (0.17) of the line fitted through zero for bioavailability where
%ABA=%BAc x 0.17. XANES analysis showed that samples from both mining and
processing areas contained lead sulfide (PbS), but absent from other sources.
Thus the various forms of lead from different sources could be related to
quantities potentially available for ingestion and/or inhalation exposure by the
Mount Isa community.

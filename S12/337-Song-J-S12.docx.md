<p style=text-align:justify>In recent years, brownfield sites have become an important source of
land for urban redevelopment in major Chinese cities. According to
Chinese laws, contaminated sites have to be cleaned up before land
transaction and redevelopment. National and regional technical
guidelines are available to evaluate the performance of remediation.
However, current guidelines are based on discrete sampling method. Due
to the inherent heterogeneity of pollutant distribution, the
representativeness of discrete samples has been proven questionable. In
addition, relevant Chinese sampling guidance does not properly evaluate
sampling error, which is the major source of error for soil
environmental monitoring data. To improve sample representativeness and
confidence in analytical data, decision unit multi increment sampling
(DUMIS) has been proposed and successfully used for expediting
investigation of contaminated sites in the US, Canada and Denmark etc.
Yet, it has never been demonstrated in China. The objectives of the
present study is to explore the suitability of modified DUMIS in
performance evaluation of immobilization of a Ni and Pb contaminated
site in China. The demonstration site was a former inorganic salts
producer, located in Shandong province, China. Environmental
investigation showed that industrial activities and illegal burial of
hazardous waste have caused soil contamination of Ni and Pb at the site.
Ex-situ immobilization was proposed as the remedy. Contaminated soil was
excavated and mixed with immobilizing agent using ALLU sieving and
mixing equipment. Treated soil was then piled up for curing followed by
confirmation sampling. In compliance with existing Chinese remediation
confirmation guidance, decision unit (DU) was set as one DU per 400m<sup>2</sup>
or 500m<sup>3</sup> soil. For each DU, a multi increment sample was taken with a
hand auger from top 0-20 cm of 50 subsample points evenly distributed
within the DU. In one of the field DU, two sets of triplicates were
taken, one by DUMIS method (50 subsample points) and the other by the
routine method (9 subsample points). To evaluate the field sampling
error, triplicates were taken from 10% of DU in the field. The results
showed that the relative standard deviation (RSD) of all field
triplicates ranged between 3.8% and 66%. The triplicates with high RSD
were collected from pit wall or pit bottom with lumps of Ni containing
hazardous waste. This study demonstrated that DUMIS method produces high
quality data which greatly improved the confidence in remediation
performance evaluation at the site.

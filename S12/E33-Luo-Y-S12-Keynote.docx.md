<p style=text-align:justify>During last three decades, China experienced rapid development of
industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural intensification,
resulting in entrance of large quantities of metal pollutants into rural
and urban soil environment through multiple pathways, causing
agricultrual and industrial land pollution. Both basic and technological
reseraches for either better understanding of biogeochemistry or for
development of risk reduction technology, of toxic metals in soil and
groundwater are urgently required for safeguard of food quality and
human health.

<p style=text-align:justify>In the 1970s, China soil environmental protection focused on preventing
metal pollution of the agricultural soil in sewage irrigated areas. In
the 1980s, significant progress was made in the research on pollution
control of heavy metals, especially arsenic and chromium. In the early
1990s, the soil metal background values on a national scale and its
regional differentiation were determined. The National Soil
Environmental Quality Standard was enacted in 1995 to provide a basis
for soil environmental management and metal pollution prevention in
particular, and the research on phytoremediation of metal polluted soil
was started in the mid-1990s. From the twenty-first century, the
National “973” Program for basic research, the National Natural Science
Foundation of China (NSFC), and the Knowledge Innovation Projects of
Chinese Academy of Sciences funded many research projects on soil metal
biogeochemistry, soil environmental quality evolution and soil risk
assessment. Remediation technologies for metal polluted site soil and
groundwater were embraced into the National “863” Program for “Hi-Tech”
development. Ten years ago, a national-wide soil pollution survey and
prevention project was carried out, and the soil pollution status at a
national scale was mapped. These projects stimulated the national
development of soil pollution risk management and remediation, including
the preliminary establishment of risk reduction technology systems of
heavy metals-polluted soil and groundwater, such as stabilisation,
oxidation/reduction, washing, reactive barrier, electrodynamics,
phytoremediation, microbial remediation, and combination technoloies.

<p style=text-align:justify>In the future, the continuing implementation of “China Action Plan for
Soil Pollution Prevention and Control” and the “National Key Research
and Development Program” will further and greatly promote reserach and
development of biogeochemistry knowledge and risk reduction technology
of metal pollutants, improve the capacity for soil environmental
governance and effectively enhance China’s industrial development in the
soil remediation.

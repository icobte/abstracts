<p style="text-align:justify">In order to explore the absorption differences of different zinc
fertilizers foliar spraying to winter wheat in the potential zinc
deficiency area of the Loess Plateau, the spraying period of the best
absorption effect was determined. Field experiment was set in the
potential zinc deficiency area of the Loess Plateau. There are six
treatments of control; spraying ZnO NPs at the jointing stage; spraying
bulk ZnO , ZnSO<sub>4</sub> and ZnO NPs at jointing stage and filling stage;
spraying ZnO NPs at jointing stage, heading stage, flowering stage and
filling stage . The results showed that there were no significant
differences in grain yield, panicle number and 1000-grain weight of
winter wheat. Among all treatments, there were no significant effect on
trace elements such as Mn and Cu in wheat grains, but had a significant
effect on Zn and Fe content. Compared with CK, the spraying of zinc
fertilizer significantly increased the zinc content of grain. The effect
of spraying zinc with different zinc fertilizers in the same period was
in ZnO NPs, reaching 30.48 mg·kg <sup>-1</sup> , which was 70% higher than that
of control. Followed by ZnSO<sub>4</sub>, which was 28.41 mg·kg <sup>-1</sup> . which was
58 % higher than that of control. The bulk ZnO was the lowest, reaching
only 21.6 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>, which was 20% higher than the control. The zinc
content of grain treated with ZnO NPs in four periods was 40.20 mg·kg
<sup>-1</sup>, which reached the recommended value for the zinc content of wheat
grains. Bulk ZnO and ZnSO<sub>4</sub> did not cause significant differences in Fe
content in winter wheat, but ZnO NPs treatment significantly increased
grain Fe content and decreased with increasing application rate. With
the increase of spraying times, the zinc contents of stems and leaves of
each treatment were significantly higher than that of control, but the
transfer efficiency from leaf to stem was low. The zinc content in the
leaves treated with ZnSO<sub>4</sub> during the filling period was 21.87 mg·kg
<sup>-1</sup> , and the ZnO NPs treatment in the same period reached 58.46 mg·kg
<sup>-1</sup> , an increase of 167%. There was no significant difference in grain
N P K content between the treatments. Synchrotron radiation X-ray
technology proved that spraying ZnO NPs four times greatly increased the
zinc content in the aleurone layer of wheat grain, which provided a good
foundation for the targeted zinc improvement.

<p style="text-align:justify">No evidence has proved that selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient
element for plants growth, but it is beneficial for human health at
optimal dosages. Nevertheless, the attention has been largely paid to
examine Se content in food stuffs because of Se deficiency in soil. Se
fertilizers application to the soil is a beneficial measure to enhance
Se content in crops, especially in the edible parts, and eventually
achieved Se supplementation for human. As one of the elemental Se
species, Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) have entered the field of version with
the advantages of high biological activity and low toxicity compared
with inorganic Se and organic Se. Unfortunately, little information is
available on SeNPs uptake by plants.

<p style="text-align:justify">Therefore, in this study, the effects of different particle sizes of
SeNPs as well as different pH on the absorption of Se by wheat
(<i>Triticum aestivum</i> L.) and rice (<i>Oryza sativa</i> L.) were investigated
through hydroponics experiments in greenhouse. The results showed that
SeNPs with different particle sizes had various characteristics for the
absorption and transportation in different plants. SeNPs with 50 nm was
more easily to be transferred from roots to shoots than SeNPs with
larger sizes (i.e. 100 nm and 150 nm); and the transportation of Se was
limited since the translocation factors were below 0.1 of all the
treatments. In addition, Se absorption by plants was also affected by
pH. Selenite [Se(IV)] was more easily absorbed by plants at lower pH,
but SeNPs could be absorbed at an optimal pH and utilized efficiently by
both of wheat and rice. Our research could provide some theoretical
bases for using a new Se resource to enhance the Se content in
agricultural products and increase the intake of Se by the populations.

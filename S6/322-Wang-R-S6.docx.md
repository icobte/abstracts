<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium contamination of rice grains represents a worldwide concern for
human health. The role of biochar in crop production and soil
remediation have been widely studied, however, very few attentions have
been paid to whether and how biochar affects microbial communities in
rhizosphere, which is an extremely important factor determining plant
growth and metal bioavailability. In the present study, we analyzed the
effects of biochar application on Cd uptake and accumulation in rice,
and its association with specific bacteria communities in rhizosphere.
The results showed that biochar application significantly reduced Cd
contents in both high- and low-Cd accumulating rice cultivars, with
particular efficacy for low-accumulating rice cultivars in highly
contaminated soil. High-throughput sequencing analysis identified both
metal-resistant and growth-promoting bacteria in the rhizosphere of
biochar-treated rice plants in Cd contaminated soils. This suggests that
specific bacteria were involved in the formation of a natural barrier
and the transformation of metal mobilization around the rhizosphere, and
to immobilize the Cd around roots of rice plants. The low-accumulating
cultivar can colonize more taxa related to metal immobilization
comparing to the high-accumulating cultivar. This study confirmed the
role that rhizobacteria acted after biochar application, analyzed
structural differences of rhizospheric colonization microbial
communities among different rice cultivars, and led a better
understanding of how the biochar were involved in Cd bioavailability in
soils and the metal uptake by rice roots. These findings thus provide
baseline data and insight toward the strategies to use biochar to reduce
Cd contamination in rice grains for ensuring safer rice production.

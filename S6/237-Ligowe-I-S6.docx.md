<p style="text-align:justify">Iodine deficiencies disorders (IDD) prevalence in Sub-Saharan countries
are highly related to low iodine soil content. To combat IDD salt
iodisation has been adopted by many countries, which is affected by
losses during food cooking, storage and the salt intake depends on the
social economic status of the smallholder community. Agronomic
bio-fortification to food crops could therefore be a feasible way to
increase iodine human intake. This study aimed at assessing the
effectiveness of iodine bio-fortification in tropical soils with
contrasting chemistry; oxisols (acidic), alfisols (medium acid) and
vertisols (calcareous). Three levels of sodium iodide (NaI) were
assessed (0, 5 and 10 kg ha<sup>-1</sup>), using both foliar and soil application
methods. The experiment used <i>Brassica napus L</i> and <i>Amaranthus
retroflexus</i> L as tester crops in an RCBD factorial experiment
replicated four times. Leaf samples were collected fortnightly starting
from 14 days after iodine application for 5 times. The results of iodine
concentration and uptake showed a sharp drop &gt; 60 % and &gt; 80 % in
<i>Amaranthus retroflexus</i> and <i>Brasca napus</i> at 28 days after iodine
application in all soil types, iodine levels and both application
methods. The drop in iodine concentration and uptake might be because of
iodine fixation in the soil, depletion and immobility within the folia
applied plant. Soil application method was more efficient in vertisols
while foliar application was observed to be more effective in all soil
types. Iodine bio-fortification was therefore observed to increase
iodine concentration, uptake by green vegetables and intake by humans
and could be a way to reduce IDD in tropical regions. Repeated
application could be considered in vegetables requiring repeated
harvests beyond 28 days after iodine application. Foliar application
method should be adopted in acidic soils where the mobility of soil
iodine is negatively affected by the presence of oxides.

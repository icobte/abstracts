<p style="text-align:justify">With the expanding use of ZnO NPs, it is inevitable to enter
environmental media during use, consumption, and disposal, raising
concerns about the possible environmental impacts of them. However,
information for seedling growth and roots development in NP-treated
plants is incomplete. In this study, the effects of ZnO NPs (0 - 200
mg/L) on the growth of maize and mung bean were studied by designing
hydroponic experiments. Analyses involve root indexes (root fresh
weight, root length, root volume, root surface area) using root scanner,
root morphology with scanning electron microscope, plant fresh weight,
metal biouptake and enzymes activities. Comparative toxicity profiles of
the ionic salts (ZnSO<sub>4</sub>) are developed. The results showed that, the Zn
content of maize and mung bean increased gradually with the increase of
the concentration of ZnO NPs compared with the control. At the 6th week,
the Zn content of the shoots and the roots increased by more than 90%.
Root indexes and fresh weight were inhibited with the ZnO NPs treatments
from low concentration of 10 mg/L. Scanning electron microscopy showed
that the apical structures of maize and mung bean treated with ZnO NPs
were incomplete, with fracture area and a large number of voids. In
terms of enzyme activity and zinc content, maize and mung bean show
different patterns, which may be related to the development of plant
roots and the characteristics of plant itself. These results suggest
that ZnO NPs significantly increase the Zn content in the shoots and
roots of maize by damaging the apical structures when exposed with ZnO
NPs. The increase of Zn content in shoots and roots of mung bean may be
affected by the dissolved Zn<sup>2+</sup> from ZnO NPs. It is further indicated
that mung bean has stronger tolerance and adaptability to ZnO NPs than
maize.

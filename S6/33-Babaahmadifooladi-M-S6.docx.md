<p style="text-align:justify">According to a risk assessment conducted by the European Food Safety
Agency EFSA (2015), there are increased concerns on nickel present in
the diet of the general population and nickel sensitive individuals in
terms of chronic and acute effects, respectively. Therefore, this study
aimed to address the following questions: which food products, available
on the Belgian market, contribute most significantly to the exposure of
the Belgian population to Nickel through different, known contamination
routes and are provoking a potential risk, i.e. chronic and acute?

<p style="text-align:justify">Therefore, different food products were purchased on the Belgian market
and their nickel contents were measured, followed by statistical
analysis for interpreting the data and exposure assessment.
Determination of nickel in the foodstuffs was performed by a
microwave-assisted acid digestion, followed by ICP-MS analysis. The
Belgian food consumption survey (2014) and @Risk software were used to
conduct a probabilistic exposure assessment.

<p style="text-align:justify">The highest average nickel concentrations were observed in tea,
chocolate, beans, hazelnut, lentils, figs, peanut and peanut butters
with average nickel contents of 6271, 4140, 2892, 2383, 1883, 1566, 1356
and 1348 μg kg<sup>-1</sup>, respectively. These products are also mainly
responsible for exposure of the Belgian population to nickel. The
average Ni concentration of 274 μg kg<sup>-1</sup>, was observed in soy products,
including soy drinks, which increases the risk of excessive Ni exposure
for lactose-intolerant children. Besides, as EFSA raised a concern on
elevated Ni concentrations previously observed in beer, a large number
of samples, i.e. 244 in total, were collected, including commercially
available beers, raw materials and semi-products used in the beer
production process. Low nickel concentrations were detected in all of
these samples, e.g. on average 8.36 µg kg<sup>-1</sup> for commercially available
beers. So beer, which is largely consumed in Belgium, is not relevant to
the exposure of the Belgian population to nickel.

<p style="text-align:justify">In conclusion, food products with elevated nickel concentrations and
their potential contamination routs have been identified in this study.
The results are relevant to the implementation of further mitigation
strategies to decrease the public health burden.

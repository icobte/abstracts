<p style="text-align:justify">Selenium is an essential trace mineral important to human health.
Selenium is a key component of various selenoproteins involved in
enzymatic activities and particularly in redox homeostasis and in
thyroid hormone metabolism. Deficiency of Se in human nutrition affects
biological functions, being in relationship with function of Se-proteins
and metabolism of Se, increases the risk of occurrence of degenerative
diseases. One promising strategy to counteract Se deficiency in humans
is Se biofortification of staple food plants. Rice represents one of the
most important staple foods worldwide; a lot of attention has been
attributed to enhance biofortification of Se in in rice as well as in
other foods in the present project. Rice seeds of 41 BRRI/local T. aman
varieties were collected from Bangladesh Rice Research Institutes (BRRI)
and farmers of different areas of Bangladesh. The seedlings were raised
in the field laboratory of the Department of Soil Science, BAU. Two Se
treatments (0 and 120 g/ha Se; calculated on ha furrow slice basis) were
used in the experiment. The experiment was laid out in completely
randomized design (CRD) with 41 varieties and each variety was
replicated three times for both Se treatments. Trace element grade
sodium selenate (Na2SeO4) was used as a source of Se. Besides, Se
content in rice we studied the growth and yield parameters of rice to
see if there is any effect of Se. In T. aman season we tested 41 rice
varieties/land-races for their response to Se treatment. Interestingly
we listed 17 varieties/land-races out of 41 showed positive effect of Se
on yield. The varieties are Absaya, Binadhan-14, Binadhan-17, Biroy, BR
22, BRRI dhan53, BRRIdhan32, BRRI dhan38, BRRI dhan52, BRRI dhan57, BRRI
dhan62, BRRI dhan66, BRRI dhan71, Kumari, Mala, Maloti, Super rice. BRRI
dhan30, BRRI dhan38, BRRI dhan52, Balam and Mala varieties were appeared
as selenium efficient T. aman rice varieties.

<p style="text-align:justify">Plate and cultivation experiments were carried out to investigate the
effects of selenomethione (SeMet) (0, 0.5, 1.0、2.5, 5.0, 10.0, 20.0,
40.0 μg g<sup>–1</sup>) on the growth of mycelium and fruiting bodies, the SeMet
uptake and transformation, and its effects on the nutritional components
and mineral elements. A dose response can be observed in the <i>A.
auricular</i> mycelium when exposed to SeMet, the IC20, IC50 and IC80 of
SeMet to mycelium was 7.6 ± 0.6, 14.5 ± 2.5, and 27.5 ± 7.2 μg g<sup>–1</sup>.
SeMet supplementation increased the concentrations of organic Se up to
15.1 μg g<sup>–1</sup>, 167.3 times
higher than the control (40 μg g<sup>–1</sup> treatment). High concentrations of
SeMet (≥10 μg g<sup>–1</sup>) significantly decreased the biomasses of <i>A.
auricula</i>. The 40 μg g<sup>–1</sup> SeMet treatment did not affect the
polysaccharide and protein, but significantly decreased the total amino
acids and essential amino acids in fruiting bodies. SeMet addition
(0.5–40.0 μg g<sup>–1</sup>) decreased the concentrations of Fe, Zn, Cu, and Cr
in fruiting bodies of <i>A. auricula</i>. The results indicate that SeMet can
be used as a Se source for <i>A. auricular</i>, but at appropriate
concentrations.

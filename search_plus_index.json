{"./":{"url":"./","title":"Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Welcome Dear Colleagues and Friends, I am very pleased to invite you all to take part in the 15th International Conference on the Biogeochemistry of Trace Elements (ICOBTE). The conference will be held during May 5th-9th 2019 in Nanjing, China. Since the first ICOBTE held in Orlando, Florida in 1990, the ICOBTE has been a highly successful conference series and has grown to become one of the most important international meetings on the biogeochemistry of both essential and toxic elements. The general theme of the 15th ICOBTE in Nanjing is “Biogeochemistry of trace elements for improved environmental sustainability and human health”. This theme reflects the great challenges we all face in protecting our environment from contamination by toxic trace elements and in providing sufficient amounts of essential trace elements for human nutrition. The conference will offer an excellent platform for scientists, regulators and environmental professionals working on trace elements across multiple disciplines to present the state-of-art research findings, exchange ideas, and discuss how the knowledge can be used for protecting our environment and for improving ecosystem and human health. Nanjing, located in the Yangtze River delta, is an ancient capital of China, serving as the capital city for six dynasties during its 2,500 years history. Nanjing not only has a prominent place in Chinese history and culture, but also is one of the major research centers and higher-education hubs in modern China with particular strength in geoscience and environmental science. We feel greatly honored that the International Society of Trace Element Biogeochemistry (ISTEB) has chosen Nanjing as the venue for the 15th ICOBTE. I very much look forward to seeing you in Nanjing. Please look through our website regularly for any update and news on the conference. Sincerely, Professor Fang-Jie Zhao Chair, ICOBTE 2019 Nanjing Agricultural University Nanjing, China "},"Plenary-Speakers/134-Sparks-D-Plenary.docx.html":{"url":"Plenary-Speakers/134-Sparks-D-Plenary.docx.html","title":"Donald L.

Rising seas and temperatures are causing increasing flooding and melting of ice and permafrost soils. The impact of these processes on biogeochemical cycling of trace elements in soils and water is not well understood. For example, how do rising seas, that cause inundation of soils with saline water, followed by retrenchment, and salinization of groundwater affect cycling of redox active elements such as arsenic (As) and chromium (Cr), as well as other trace elements. Under changing climatic conditions, how will sequestration of C by oxide minerals be impacted, and resultant mobility of trace elements? This presentation will explore these questions, and others, over a range of spatial and temporal scales.

T. Wang, G. W. Zhou and X. M. Xue Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China ygzhu@iue.ac.cn Arsenic is a ubiquitous trace element and adversely affects soil biota and human health. Microorganisms regulate the bioavailability and energy metabolism process of arsenic in the soil ecosystem. Previous studies indicated that the gut microbiome of soil fauna living in a key transient anoxic micro-zone makes a significant contribution to the metabolism and biogeochemical cycles of carbon and nitrogen in the host. Gut microbiome is the extended genotype of the host. So far, the effect of soil contamination on gut bacterial community and arsenic related genes (we term this as the “gut feeling”) of soil fauna remains poorly understood. To investigate the “gut feeling” of soil fauna to arsenic contamination, we choose the earthworms and nematode as the model organisms. Gut microbial community and arsenic biotransformation genes (ABGs) were characterized by using Illumina sequencing of 16S rRNA and high-throughput quantitative PCR, respectively. High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Inductively coupled plasma -mass spectrometry was used to analyze arsenic species. Using four earthworm species (the epigeic Eisenia Andrei, anecic Amynthas hupeiensis, Metaphire californica and M. vulgaris) from soils with low arsenic concentration, we found that both of low arsenic and ecological niches caused shifts in the abundance of ABGs and the community structure of gut microbiota. A microcosm experiment, conducted using the model species E. fetida treated with different arsenic concentrations, demonstrated that arsenic contamination exerted a significant inhibition on the growth and survival of animals. ABGs involved in arsenic redox and efflux were predominant, and those involved in arsenic methylation and demethylation were very low. Moreover, exposure to arsenate (As(V)) led to a substantial alteration of gut microbial community which was dominated by Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Proteobacteria at the phylum level. To further determine the influence of microbiota on physiology of soil animals exposed to arsenic, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was fed with As(V) and three Escherichia coli strains, E. coli AW3110 (ΔarsRBC), E. coli BL 21, or E. coli BL 21 containing arsM. The results showed that As(V) was not transformed in the gut of C. elegans fed on E. coli AW3110 (ΔarsRBC), part of As(V) was reduced in the gut containing E. coli BL 21, and methylated arsenic species was found in the gut with E. coli BL 21 containing arsM. In addition, As(III) in the gut decreased the broodsize of C. elegans, and methylated arsenic in the gut of C. elegans alleviated the adverse impact of As(III) on the broodsize. Vitellogenin, the precursor of egg yolk phosphoproteins, was induced by increased As(III) concentration in the C. elegans, suggesting that As(III) performed a critical impact on the reproduction of C. elegans. In summary, our study reveals that the earthworm is a reservoir of microbes with the capability of reducing As(V) and extruding As(III) with little methylation of arsenic, and arsenic transformation by gut microbiota in turn impacted the health of their hosts. The “gut feeling” is carried out and regulated by its microbiota.

Marie Muehea,b a Earth System Science Department, Stanford University, USA b Center for Applied Geoscience, University of Tuebingen, Germany fendorf@stanford.edu A ubiquitous contaminant of soils and sediments, arsenic arguably poses the greatest threat to human health of any naturally occurring compound. Nowhere is the threat more apparent than in the groundwater systems of South and Southeast Asia. Derived from sulfide minerals within rock outcrops and coal seams, arsenic is transferred to iron(III) oxides (inclusive of oxyhydroxides and hydroxides) upon weathering of the Himalayan rock strata. Transported down the large river systems during the annual monsoonal storms, the arsenic hosting iron oxide particles are deposited across the vast floodplains of the low-lying regions. With continued burial, the arsenic-bearing particles progressively reside deeper within the sediments; once the height of the water table exceeds the particle position, anaerobic metabolic processes lead to the reductive dissolution of the arsenic (and iron). Arsenic, upon conversion to arsenite, is then free to move with the advecting water, resulting in wide-spread contamination of groundwater. The rate of arsenic release, however, varies depending largely upon the organic carbon content and pathway of decomposition. In combination with heterogeneous groundwater flow paths, arsenic concentrations can be highly variable across even short distances of the aquifer. Herein, the specific combination of hydrologic states and resulting biogeochemical processes responsible for arsenic liberation and distribution in groundwater are described. The groundwater threat of arsenic is clear, and mitigation or adaptation strategies have been underway for many years. The threat posed to food supplies, and specific rice, are, by contrast, still being revealed. We illustrate that the combined effects of increasing temperature (resulting from global warming) couple with arsenic have devastating impacts on both rice yield and grain quality. Our findings show a nearly 40% reduction in yield with a 5 °C increase in temperature for the major rice growing regions of the world. Further, the concentration of inorganic arsenic within the rice grain doubles with the temperature change. As a result of changes in plant physiology and soil biogeochemical processes, varying soil arsenic concentrations and elevated temperature, along with carbon dioxide, lead to a complex shift in arsenic cycling within the rhizosphere. In combination, the impacts of soil arsenic and climate change will lead to a devastation in food production.

In order to understand the genetic basis of plant-soil interactions in an ecological and evolutionary context, we focus on the species Arabidopsis halleri, within which exceptionally diverse adaptations to local soil composition are known. Among the closest relatives of the model species A. thaliana, A. halleri is a zinc (Zn) and cadmium (Cd) hyperaccumulator, meaning that single individuals contained more than 10,000 µg g-1 Zn or more than 100 µg g-1 Cd in leaf dry biomass at their natural sites of growth in the field. Populations of A. halleri are naturally found on calamine metalliferous soils containing toxic levels of Zn, Cd and lead (Pb), but they are more widespread on pristine non-metalliferous soils. Hyperaccumulation of Cd was observed in a subset of populations on both types of soil, thus indicating that the enrichment of the non-essential metal Cd in leaves can be enormously efficient in A. halleri. We expect these diverse phenotypic characteristics to be of interest for the future improvement of phytoremediation and phytomining applications. We combine fieldwork with genetic and genomic as well as molecular biology approaches in order to understand how diverse adaptations to local soils function and arise in A. halleri, focusing here on soil Cd levels. Cd is a comparably rare soft metal that generally lacks a nutritional function and has very high toxicity potential in biological organisms. Progressively enriched with successive trophic levels, elevated environmental Cd levels are an important human health concern. Similar to other cells, plant roots take up Cd2+ cations inadvertently through transmembrane transport proteins, for example of divalent nutrient cations Fe2+, Zn2+ and Ca2+, and they universally possess a molecular machinery capable of conferring low-level basal Cd tolerance. Elevated Cd tolerance of A. halleri accessions originating from geogenically or anthropogenically Cd-enriched environments indicate that Cd can be the source of substantial selective pressure in natural environments. We will discuss first candidate sequence variants found in populations on extremely Cd-contaminated soil through genome-wide association studies in A. halleri. These are beginning to provide information on the targets of Cd toxicity in natural plant populations. Finally, comparative transcriptomics of A. halleri populations from contrasting environments detail plants’ needs for nutrient balancing in Cd-rich environments. In summary, we have taken first steps towards understanding how opposing directions of selection in differing environments have led to a large extent of within-species phenotypic variation in Cd handling in A. halleri.

It will give an introduction that the molecular form of an element is important to understand and describe processes involving trace elements in the environment. Aspects of non-targeted analysis including de-novo identification and quantification without molecular standards will be covered in contrast for larger sample throughput analysis. Using mass balance approaches it be illustrated that often not only one analytical technique is necessary to determine all elemental species from one element but rather a whole range of complimentary instrumentations. In this truly metallomics approach it is often necessary to consider also the formation of particulate element species. Not only is the proportion of the elemental species but rather the size of these particles important for any prediction how the elements would behave in the environment. Using a series of case studies it will highlight the use of a range of analytical methods, from HPLC-ICPMS simultaneously coupled to ESI-MS, ICP-TOF-MS, AF4-UV-MALS-ICPMS and imaging techniques such as LA-ICPMS, XRF and techniques for stoichiometric determination of particles such as single particle ICP-TOF-MS.

Arsenic is a component of 245 minerals, associated most frequently with other metals, such as copper, gold, lead, and zinc, in sulfidic ores. Many arsenic species undergo (bio)transformation, and the toxicities of the various arsenic species vary by several orders of magnitude. Our first objective is to determine arsenic speciation, and we focus on the method of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation and simultaneous detection with both inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). This methodology enables identification and quantitation of individual arsenic species present in various environmental media. Arsenic is one of the most important environmental agents causing chronic human disease. A wide variety of adverse health effects, including bladder, lung, and skin cancers, and many non-cancerous effects, have been attributed to chronic exposure to arsenic. The mechanisms of arsenic toxicity are complicated and not fully understood. The trivalent arsenic species have high affinity with free sulfhydryl groups in proteins. Arsenic binding to a specific site of the protein could alter the conformation and function of the protein as well as its recruitment of and interaction with other functional proteins. We summarize various aspects of arsenic binding to proteins, demonstrate analytical techniques for the characterization of arsenic binding, and discuss the chemical basis, biological implications, and consequences of arsenic binding to proteins.

The Casparian strip is a belt-like structure formed of lignin that surrounds endodermal cells, running parallel to the root surface. It is tightly adhered to the plasma membrane and bridges the extracellular space between adjacent cells to form a tight junction between them. On the other hand, suberin forms a waxy coatings around endodermal cells that limits transport across the plasma membrane. Cross-talk between the Casparian strip and suberin exists, with suberin being deposited in response to disruption of Casparian strips.

Exposure to cadmium and lead increased rapidly in most countries following the 1940s. Their half-lives, moreover, are extremely long, as they accumulate in bone tissue for lead and in soft tissues for cadmium. Aging populations today have thus accumulated more lead and cadmium in the body than at any other time in history. Arsenic is found mostly in groundwater and food, in particular rice affecting general populations worldwide. Several systematic reviews have evaluated studies investigating the association between lead and cadmium with incident cardiovascular disease (coronary heart disease and stroke). Bone and blood lead, urine and blood cadmium, and water and urine arsenic are consistently associated with increased cardiovascular mortality and/or incidence in multiple studies after adjustment for traditional risk factors. Observational studies are limited by confounding and selection bias. We also considered evidence from a double blind randomized clinical trial (Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy (TACT)) comparing the effects of edetate disodium, a chelating agent that excretes both lead and cadmium, to placebo in post-myocardial infarction participants (N=1708). The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, and angina hospitalization. Participants receiving edetate disodium-based infusions showed a reduction in the primary composite endpoint by 18% (hazard ratio 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99, p = 0.035; number needed to treat (NNT) to prevent 1 event over 5 years of follow-up was18). TACT2, an ongoing NIH trial is replication trial and will also evaluate the possibility that lead and cadmium mediate the cardiovascular benefit of edetate disodium in post-myocardial infarction patients. The well-established effect of metals on oxidative stress is a possible mechanisms for metal-related cardiovascular disease.

Hatcher, H. Chen, and D.C. Waggoner Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, Virginia, USA phatcher@odu.edu Solid-state 13C NMR spectra have been used extensively to examine the transformation of plant materials in soils as they undergo humification. Unfortunately, the spectra are viewed as non-quantitative if the cross polarization magic angle spinning methods are used. Employing direct polarization with magic angle spinning has been viewed as overcoming this problem but requires exceedingly and often prohibitively long acquisition time to obtain spectra with adequate signals. A recently introduced technique called multi cross polarization allows for quantitative spectra at short acquisition times has become an important new method for analysis of whole soils directly. However, this approach cannot mitigate the influence that Fe3+ has on the signals. Fe is ubiquitous in soils, especially in mineral soils and horizons, and binds readily to highly hydroxylated and carboxylated humic materials. The hypothesis we put forward is that Fe3+ interferes with NMR signals and influences trends observed during humification. Our studies show that the humic materials produced from humification of plant biomass become partly “NMR invisible” due mainly to their strong association with Fe3+. Meanwhile the unaltered plant biomass, low in Fe, retains its NMR signature and dominates the spectrum. This effect provides biased characterization of soil organic matter, especially when it is separated into different density fractions where the mineral- and Fe-rich fractions typically show deviant behaviour and when it is compared with data from a multitude of non-NMR characterization methods. When soil and peat samples are treated to remove Fe3+ prior to NMR analysis the spectra obtained are more in line with other spectral characterizations. It is noteworthy that for samples with almost no Fe content, similar NMR spectra were obtained with and without the Fe removal treatment. The disproportionate effects of Fe3+ to aromatic and aliphatic components, respectively, has contributed to a misleading understanding of soil organic matter formation processes which needs to be re-evaluated. For example, a recent suggestion that soil organic matter forms from microbial and root exudates protected from degradation by mineral associations is simply wrong because the data used to support this new hypothesis comes mainly from NMR studies that fail to recognize the influence of Fe.

The advantages of these techniques are well known: minimal sample preparation (e.g. reduce risk of artefacts), high lateral and spatial resolution, ability to probe the speciation of elements in situ. However, until recently, synchrotron techniques have been considered generally ‘slow’ and not particularly sensitive in comparison with other methods providing very detailed information on a few samples at reasonably high concentrations. This has changed. The advent of fast and sensitive detector technologies has completely transformed the way we approach synchrotron experiments and the information we can obtain. For instance, traditionally, X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) elemental mapping has been used to gain an understanding of metal distribution while X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) has been employed to investigate metal speciation. This latter approach has been performed at both the ‘bulk’ and microscale; these two approaches being complementary and providing different information. However, in the last few years, the development of a new generation of fast fluorescence detectors providing unprecedented rates of data acquisitions is blurring the divide between imaging and speciation techniques due to the developments of methods such as XANES-imaging (X-Ray Absorption Near Edge-imaging). Furthermore, fast detectors have allowed us to probe not just larger samples and more samples, they have also decreased the risk of beam damage and in-vivo, time series experiments are now possible. At the same time, the development of ever more sensitive detectors and higher fluxes have enabled the analyses of trace element distribution and speciation at concentrations that are environmentally relevant. In this presentation we will discuss how new technologies have changed the information we can obtain from synchrotron experiments, how their design has changed over time and will also briefly discuss what fourth-generation synchrotron sources will enable us to do.

In many such systems, including wetland soils and the hyporheic zone of streambeds, anaerobic processes are responsible for a number of biogeochemical processes with substantial environmental impacts. These include servings as major sources of the greenhouse gases methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) as well as being key locations of Hg methylation. The biogeochemistry of subsurface zones of aquatic systems has been widely explored from the perspective of redox conditions, substrate availability, and thermodynamic controls on metabolic processes. However, an additional yet under-examined constraint is the availability of trace element micronutrients. An array of metalloenzymes that contain trace elements in cofactors are essential to many metabolic pathways that underlie important biogeochemical processes. Pure culture studies have demonstrated inhibition of methanogenesis, denitrification, and Hg methylation when essential trace elements have low availability. However, similar studies of natural systems are rare, and it is unclear if trace element availability limits biogeochemical processes in the environment. We have investigated possible trace element limitations during methanogenesis in anaerobic peat and muck horizons from wetland soils from two U.S. states, Missouri and Florida. 40-day incubations of wetland soil from the Missouri site showed a 10-fold increase in CH4 production following addition of Ni, which is required in all enzymatic pathways to CH4. In contrast, soil from the Florida site showed no change in CH4 production following the addition of Ni or other trace elements involved in the enzymatic pathways for methanogenesis. Surprisingly, the Florida wetland showed lower native dissolved and solid-phase trace element concentrations than the Missouri site yet produced more CH4 in unamended systems. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) revealed that Ni added to the Missouri soil bound to reduced sulfur, possibly as a mixture of NiS and thiol-bound Ni, but formed carboxyl-bound species in the Florida site. This is consistent with the 100-times greater S content of the Missouri soil as well as a larger reduced S fraction. Speciation of the native Ni present at both sites appeared to be similar, occurring as mixtures of sulfur- and carboxyl-bound species, but XAS provided limited information because of the low solid-phase Ni contents (6-25 ppm) in the soils. X-ray microfluorescence imaging indicated that Ni was associated with both organic and inorganic sulfur species in the Missouri soil, but did not correlate with sulfur in the Florida soil. Together, these observations suggest that sulfur speciation and abundance strongly impact trace element availability and associated limitations on other biogeochemical processes in wetlands. This work highlights the critical need to understand the speciation of trace elements in soil and aquatic systems in order to predict their impact on their environment, a key theme of Prof. Spark's long research career. It also demonstrates the challenges posed to determining trace element speciation in natural materials at low concentrations, necessitating novel approaches and further advances in analytical instrumentation.

The recent advent of liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (LCTEM) allows directly observing important dynamic events of nanomaterials in fluid. Here, LCTEM was utilized to directly observe aggregation and dissolution behaviours of different sized hematite nanoparticles in liquid. When mass concentrations were same, the aggregates of 9 nm nanoparticles were statistically more compact and slightly larger than those of 36 nm nanoparticles. Increasing ionic strength resulted in larger aggregates and also enhanced the attachment efficiency between small aggregates in water which directly confirms the DLVO theory that the lower energy barrier to aggregation as ionic strength increases. Dissolution behavior of isolated and aggregated hematite particles in 10, 36, and 103 nm, respectively, was also investigated using LCTEM in water under a relative high beam dose rate. The high spatial and temporal resolution of LCTEM enables us to differentiate the respective effect of primary particle size, crystal defects, and aggregation state on particle dissolution. At similar electron-beam irradiation parameters, the initial surface-area normalized dissolution rates (RSA,Int) of isolated 10, 36, and 103 nm particles are 4.64 ± 3.60, 0.91 ± 0.44, and 0.24 ± 0.04 mg m-2 s-1, respectively. Interface free energy, calculated from the measured RSA,Int, decreases with decreasing primary particle size. Furthermore, the mode of dissolution switched from surface-retreat in the relatively defect-free smaller particles to defect-based dissolution in the larger particles. In dissolution of aggregated particles, dissolution occurs more rapidly on the particles that are more accessible to bulk solution than the others in one aggregate. As dissolution proceeds, dendritic aggregates break into several smaller aggregates that respectively shrink into smaller and more compact aggregates, followed by reaggregation together. This study directly presented the influences of particle size and ionic strength on aggregation state and shows microscopic dissolution behavior of isolated and aggregated particles in different primary particle sizes, which is important to understand bioavailability, transport, and fate of nanoparticles in aquatic systems.

However, the relationship between structure and chemical reactivity remains ambiguous as little variation in the structural and chemical composition exhibits significant changes in the reactivity. Molecular modeling is essential to reduce the ambiguity. Indeed first-principle calculations based on density functional theory (DFT) have resolved many ambiguities in the metal sorption mechanisms, in particular, related to Mn(IV) vacancies. Nevertheless, the dynamic features of interlayer structures are challenging to explore with DFT only. Classical molecular dynamic (MD) simulations using interatomic pair potentials is an alternative method to examine the dynamic features. This talk introduces a newly developed set of pair-potentials for classical MD simulations that can deal with more realistic Mn oxide models. MD simulation results are presented as to the relationship among the interlayer cation/water content and structures and the Mn octahedral sheet stacking modes.

It is a carcinogenic element that exists primarily as arsenate [As(V)] and arsenite [As(III)] in the nature environment, with As(III) being more toxic and mobile of the two species. In addition, ferrihydrite, which is widely distributed in soils and aquatic environments, can catalyze the oxidation of Mn(II) and accelerate the formation of high-valence Mn, which can significantly influence the speciation, toxicity, and mobility of As when these species co-exist. In this context, we herein explored the mechanism of As(III) oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and Mn(II) using a kinetic approach combined with multiple spectroscopic techniques, including X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy, in situ horizontal attenuated total-reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in situ quick scanning X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Our results indicate that efficient As(III) oxidation by dissolved O2 occurs on the surface of ferrihydrite in the presence of aqueous Mn(II). Compared with As(III) oxidation in the presence of ferrihydrite and Mn oxides (i.e., Mn oxides/hydroxides), the degree of As(III) oxidation in the ferrihydrite-Mn(II) system was significantly higher, and the majority of generated As(V) was adsorbed on the mineral (i.e., ferrihydrite) surface. Furthermore, As(III) oxidation was enhanced upon increasing both the molar ratio of Mn(II)/As(III) and the solution pH. The greater As(III) oxidation by O2 in the ferrihydrite-Mn(II) system was mainly attributed to the formation of a strong oxidant of the instantaneous intermediate Mn(III) species via Mn(II) oxidation under catalysis by the ferrihydrite surface. Moreover, As(III) oxidation occurred mainly on the ferrihydrite surface and was accompanied by the regeneration of Mn(II), thereby rendering it recyclable. These results therefore provide new insights into the mechanism of As(III) oxidation on the surfaces of Fe oxides (i.e., Fe oxides/hydroxides) in the presence of aqueous Mn(II) as well as the new details regarding the electron transfer mechanisms between the As(III)-Mn(II, III)-O2 species at the ferrihydrite surface, and could lead to novel approaches for As(III) contaminant remediation in the environment.

The presence of As has been well documented in multiple environmental matrices including groundwater, soil and sediment, and foods. The toxicity and mobility of As depend on its speciation. The need for rapid and sensitive field As speciation analysis has motivated great research efforts for decades. Surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) is a rapid and ultrasensitive spectroscopic technique in chemical analysis, taking advantage of the explosive growth in nanofabrication. Herein, we present a portable SERS sensor for on site monitoring of arsenic speciation. Fe3O4@Ag core-shell magnetic NPs, which are capable of fast preconcentration, rapid separation, and high SERS sensitivity, were used as a reliable SERS substrate for determination of As(III) and As(V). The entire process can be completed within 2 min. Moreover, the active SERS substrate can be used for As sensing in complex media such as juice, wine, and soils. The electromagnetic (EM) mechanism and short-range chemical (CT) effect simultaneously contribute to the overall SERS enhancement. The former does not involve the formation of chemical bonds between the analyte and the substrate, and thus the Raman bands do not shift significantly. In the CT mechanism the Raman peaks are selectively enhanced when excited by different laser lines. Moreover, the CT mechanism depends sensitively on the particular chemical bonds between the analyte and the substrate, resulting in shifts in peak positions. The magnetic SERS platform provides a robust and versatile approach in rapid detection of multiple trace elements in the field using a portable Raman spectrometer.

In particular, despite their relatively low abundance, iron and manganese minerals can provide a first order control on trace metal cycling, through coupled sorption and redox reactions. These interactions at the mineral-water interface are well known to strongly influence metal speciation and isotopic composition, and also metal concentration and distribution between the solid and aqueous components of soil and sediment systems. The effect of soil and sediment diagenesis on the mineral-water interface however, is less well known, and it is unclear how the aging and transformation of iron and manganese minerals influences the mobiity and ultimate fate of metals in soil and sediment systems. Here we use a combination of advanced, high resolution analytical techniques, including transmission electron microscopy and X-ray absorption spectroscopy and microscopy, coupled with laboratory sorption and isotope fractionation experiments, to investigate the reactivity and cycling of trace metals in the terrestrial and marine environments, focusing on the sorption and diagenetic processes that control metal cycling between soils and sediments and associated waters.

The carbon sequestration of both materials may be improved by the addition of minerals and worms. The composition of the resulting organic amendments may affect plant growth nutrient uptake and carbon flow at the soil-root interphase. The study of these small scale processes benefits from new analytical developments. In the present study, we investigated (1) the effect of different types of compost (with and without addition of clay mineral and worms) on root and shoot biomass production of two contrasted plants (Fabaceae and Poaceae) and (2) the transfer of plant-derived carbon into different soil compartments. Our conceptual approach consisted of using continuous stable isotope labeling and NanoSIMS analyses of the rhizospheric soil under two plant species grown for six weeks in microcosms filled with soil amended with contrasting organic amendments. Our results showed contrasting biomass production depending on the type of amendment. Two samples presenting contrasting elemental and isotopic results were selected for nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS) analyses in order to depict organo-mineral interactions and the incorporation of 13C at the root-soil interface.

Organic matter (OM) has abundant heterogeneous sites controlling the kinetic reactions of cations. Iron (Fe) oxides are among the most important mineral adsorbents to control the reactivity and fate of both cation and oxyanion contaminants, while manganese (Mn) oxides exhibit high reactivity with redox sensitive elements such as arsenic (As). Furthermore, the dynamic interactions between OM and minerals play a key role in controlling the fate of carbon (C) and metals/metalloids. Currently, there is still a lack of mechanistic and quantitative understanding on the role of soil binding sites and coupled reactions in controlling the kinetic behavior of ions in soil. In this talk, we will first describe the development of the unified kinetics model for both cation and oxyanion adsorption/desorption on OM and Fe oxides based on chemical speciation models including WHAM and CD-MUSIC model. The key idea of our model is to constrain the adsorption and desorption rate coefficients for each specific binding site and the variations of adsorption or desorption rate coefficients among different binding sites. We quantitatively demonstrated how the equilibrium binding of cations and oxyanions with various soil binding sites affected the adsorption and desorption rates. We will also introduce the development of the quantitative models for the coupled kinetics of oxyanions adsorption/desorption/oxidation on MnO2.

We studied the kinetic processes, at nano and even sub-nano scales, by time-resolved chemical imaging with spherical aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cs-STEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Our experimental and modeling results demonstrated that the rates of metal/metalloid speciation changes within Fe minerals were coupled with Fe mineral transformation rates. The results help to elucidate the dynamic behavior of C and metals/metalloids during the Fe minerals transformation processes, and also shed lights on nano-scale mechanisms of OM interactions with Fe oxides, which is essential to accurately predict bioavailability and accessibility of contaminants and OM. Our research contributes to developing comprehensive models for predicting the kinetic behavior of metals/metalloids and OM in soil environments.

Our team seeks to optimize microfluidic devices for compatibility with synchrotron X-ray analytical methods, such as microXRF mapping and microXAFS speciation determinations. Successful development of synchrotron-optimized microfluidic cells requires careful selection of materials used for device fabrication (in particular the window material). Numerous methods are available for fabricating microfluidic devices, but two have gained the most notoriety for studying biogeochemical processes transpiring on a microscale: casting devices in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) and etching Si wafers using now-standard photolithography techniques. A pilot experiment was conducted using a natural pore network device constructed by soft lithography using PDMS. The internal surface was made hydrophilic to introduce silanol (Si-OH) functional groups and destroy methyl groups (Si-CH3). The network was a simulated sandy loam structure generated from a 3-D packing algorithm. This aggregated soil structure has “grains” arranged to form ~1 mm-diameter aggregates. It is well suited for addressing questions concerning impacts of physical heterogeneity on reaction product formation and distribution. Our pilot experiment simulated the release of arsenite (AsO3) into groundwater containing trace elements (Zn, Cu and Ni) and other nutrients (SO4, Ca and K). We observed the occurrence of hydrous As(III)/Zn/Cu precipitates (formed below the saturation index) in micropore domains with apparent flow restriction. This result is exciting because As(III) is difficult to remove from natural waters without advanced oxidation processes (general approach is to convert As(III) to As(V) and then remove it from solution). Further measurements are required to establish if surfaces themselves provided nucleation sites that induced As(III) precipitation below the saturation index. It is reasonable that the saturation index might locally be exceeded by accumulating Zn and/or Cu ions at surfaces. It is speculated these micropore-localized precipitates are stable As(III) minerals, such as reinerite Zn3(AsO3)2 or trippkeite Cu(As2O4). Future work will include microbeam Zn K-edge and Cu K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy to characterize these precipitates. Future experiments will introduce microorganisms that respire on As and possibly alter the long-term stability of the As(III) precipitates. Continued development of synchrotron-optimized microfluidic cells will enable in-situ characterization of pore-scale biogeochemistry.

To achieve these advances, it is often not possible to rely on a single method. Putting together the results from a number of different methods to assess speciation and likely mechanisms for movement in biotic and abiotic parts of the system is often very fruitful. Finally, the increased mechanistic level understanding gained allows insights and interventions for managing environmental or biological activity to be designed and tested, so that more beneficial and sustainable outcomes are promoted. This presentation gives several case studies of how such investigations can be fruitful with examples of environmental toxic or essential trace elements. Use of complementary methods for assessment is highlighted. First is the use of LC-ICP-MS, synchrotron and NanoSIMS to follow the important threat of mobilisation and transport of arsenic in paddy rice systems. These identified 1) that arsenite species predominate under flooded conditions, 2) this is very mobile in the soil-plant interface, 3) rice plants use the same effective system for the transport for the beneficial element Si and for arsenite species, 4) inside the plant, arsenite is transformed and some is transported to the grain that people eat whereas Si is diverted mainly to the leaves and 5) although movement of inorganic As is held up to some extent at the material/seed interface, methylated organic As compounds are more effectively transported to the white endosperm of rice which people most often consume. Second is the transformation of nanoparticles (NP) in the soil-plants system. Using a number of techniques, we can detect the transformation of ZnO, a commonly used NP, in soils and it uptake and transport in plants. From this, we know that ZnO-NPs are rapidly transformed and act like more soluble Zn salts after additions to soil. This has implications for the effective use of different forms of this essential nutrient, and for toxic risk assessment of such NPs. Finally, Se deficiency is widespread and we have investigated the forms of Se in soils and the uptake of this essential nutrients by plants. This has revealed its speciation in soils, uptake and competition in plant sulphur uptake mechanisms, its forms transported, the location of Se in grain, and its likely bioavailability availability to human and animal consumers.

In addition, the relative abundances of these complexes can change as a function of solution pH and the anion-proton dissociation/association, and water state. The kinetics of the formation of strongly and weakly bound complexes also vary significantly between ions at particle interfaces, and the weak H-bonded and hydrated complexes are expected to form more rapidly and are the first step in the formation of subsequent, stronger, inner-sphere complexes.

They are present in many consumer products, such as personal care products and food products. After use, a large proportion of TiO2 ends up in agricultural soils, through the application of sewage sludge. A prerequisite for risk assessment is to be able to distinguish this released TiO2 from the elevated TiO2 natural background, and therefore detect anthropogenic inputs. Furthermore, the current models of nanomaterial fluxes in environmental compartments have large uncertainties, therefore field monitoring is needed to be able to quantify actual anthropogenic inputs. In this study, the potential of analytical techniques, namely micro and nano X-ray fluorescence (XRF), bulk and micro X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to distinguish natural versus anthropogenic particles was investigated. Three matrices were compared: sewage sludge, agricultural soil that had never received sewage sludge, and sludge-amended soil. The size distribution of TiO2 particles was determined by image analysis of the Ti nanoXRF maps. This revealed that the soil and sludge have a similar size distribution, with a range of nano- and micro-scale particles. Bulk Ti K-edge XAS spectroscopy showed that the two major Ti species were the TiO2 polymorphs anatase and rutile. In the sludge, there were roughly equal proportions of rutile and anatase. This information is important because rutile and anatase have different toxicities. It is difficult to know which polymorph is used in which type of product, and what are the global proportions of rutile and anatase released into the environment. Amorphous TiO2 was also detected as a minor species in the soil and in the sludge by µXAS. The combination of µXRF and µXAS data showed that there was no relationship between the size of the aggregates and Ti speciation. Finally, the morphology of the crystals observed by electron microscopy and the status of TiO2 particles within the organo-mineral aggregates revealed as relevant criteria to discriminate natural versus anthropogenic TiO2. In the sludge, smooth particles typical of TiO2 pigments were evidenced, whereas the soil contained rough and irregular TiO2 particles. Moreover, TiO2 particles in the sludge were present as weakly evolved aggregates, dominated by organic matter, whereas in the soil they were intimately associated with organo-mineral assemblages forming the soil micro- and macroaggregates, the building blocks of soils. The observed differences in particle morphology may attenuate over time due to the weathering of TiO2 minerals. Likewise, the formation of soil aggregates is a dynamic and continuous process, so the progressive incorporation of anthropogenic TiO2 within these organo-mineral assemblages is expected. It is likely that with time, engineered TiO2 become indistinguishable from the natural background in soils.

Therefore, it is important to understand Zn isotope fraction during its sorption onto soil minerals and the underlying mechanism. In this study, we quantify zinc isotope fractionation during its sorption onto Al oxide, by performing experiments under various pH and total Zn concentrations and measuring Zn isotope signature using Multicollector-Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). Results showed a systematic enrichment in heavy Zn isotopes on the surface of Al oxide, with Δ66Zn adsorbed-solution ranging from 0.50±0.16‰ at low pH (e.g., pH 6) and low concentration (e.g., 0.2 mM) to 0.10 ± 0.02‰ at high pH (e.g., pH7.5) and high concentration (e.g., 0.8 mM). These different magnitudes of Zn fractionation are related to structural differences between Zn sorption mechanism existing on the high pH (octahedrally coordinated Zn by oxygen atoms) and low pH (tetrahedrally coordinated Zn by oxygen atoms), as evidenced by Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy. EXAFS analysis also suggest Zn-Al layered double hydroxide (LDH) formed at high pH and high concentration, the structure of which has a Zn-O bond distance of 2.06 Å. In contrast, at low pH or low concentration, results from EXAFS indicates Zn sorbed as an inner-sphere surface complex, with Zn-O interatomic distance being 1.99 Å. These two distinct mechanisms indicate that Zn isotope fractionation is dominantly controlled by the chemical composition of the solution (pH, concentration) and these factors should be considered when using Zn isotope to track pollution source.

Most of radiocesium was emitted from the broken nuclear reactors as soluble forms and then strongly adsorbed on weathered micaceous minerals after deposition on soil. However, insoluble spherical microparticles containing radiocesium were discovered from aerosol filters collected on March 14, 2011. Subsequently, similar insoluble Cs-bearing radioactive microparticles (CsMPs) were found in soil, river sediment, dust, plant tissues collected from Fukushima and surrounding areas and they were characterized with SR-XRF/XAS or SEM/TEM/STEM by many researchers. The main body of CsMPs is silicate glass. Analyses by SR-XRF revealed that CsMPs contained fission products such as Cs, Sn, Mo, Te and U. The spherical CsMPs concentrate 0.1 to 3 Bq of radiocesium in the particles of a few microns in diameter and have stronger radioactivity than clay minerals contaminated by soluble radiocesium. The fate of CsMPs in the environment is not well-understood. Since silicate glass is slowly dissolved in water, CsMP is expected to disappear from the environment at some point in future. The purpose of this study is to investigate how CsMPs are modified in the environment by weathering. We compared shape and structure in CsMPs before and after dissolution in water by SEM/TEM/STEM. We also estimated the dissolution rate of CsMPs in water. CsMPs were collected from non-woven cloth (NWC) that had covered the fields in Fukushima when radiocesium was deposited in March 2011. CsMPs were isolated from the other unrelated particles and observed by SEM-EDS. After observation, CsMPs were immersed in ion-exchange water at 120, 90 and 60 °C until their radiocesium activity became around a half by dissolution. CsMP after the dissolution treatment was observed by SEM-EDS again and then also observed by STEM-EDS after being thinned so as to be electron-transparent using an FIB system. We also observed CsMPs captured by dust filters collected from Fukushima in 2015. Before the dissolution treatment, CsMPs had a spherical shape. After dissolution treatment in water, the forms of CsMPs were considerably altered from spherules, suggesting that the dissolution proceeded intricately without maintaining geometric homogeneity. Tin oxide and iron oxide nanoparticulates were formed on the surfaces of CsMPs after dissolution. These features were consistent with a CsMP collected from dust filters in 2015, indicating that CsMPs were not stable in the environment but collapsed with aging. The dissolution rate of CsMPs in water was estimated to be 0.011 µm/year at 13 °C, mean annual temperature in Fukushima.

A new approach based on extrapolating measurements of suspension Wien effect is suggested to determine the adsorbed ions distribution in the different compartments of the EDL. The new approach was applied to assess Zn2+ distribution in the EDL of Zn-saturated soil colloids. The results showed that more than 84% of Zn2+ was adsorbed via chemical interactions and located in the inner Helmholtz plane layer. The remaining Zn2+ fraction was electrically adsorbed and distributed in the outer Helmholtz plane layer (0.3% to 2.1%) and in the Gouy-Chapman diffuse layer (7.4% to 15.0%). Independently, the results of linear combination fitting (LCF) of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra indicated that the contents of outer-sphere Zn in paddy soil I and boggy soil were consistent with the proportions of Zn2+ electrostatically interacting with the soil colloids based on the extrapolation of the suspension Wien effect method, while the contents of outer-sphere Zn in paddy soil II, yellow cinnamon soil and yellow brown soil was overestimated by the EXAFS method.

Biofilm production is a common trait among microorganisms in a wide range of environmental, engineered, and host-associated ecosystems. However, as for soil systems, the complexity of edaphic microenvironment hinders the advances toward understanding soil biofilm formation processes, structure and ecological functions. In this work, artificial soil was employed to investigate the soil biofilm formation and corresponding ecological impacts under well-defined conditions. []Our results showed that soil biofilm formed under high-nutrient condition. The soil with biofilm exhibited a rapid response to nutrient provision and robust microbial activity, which depleted oxygen in the topsoil. Kinetic respiration analysis revealed that soil biofilm sustained 40-times more active microbes than that without biofilm, while the specific growth rates were comparable. 16S rDNA sequencing demonstrated similar microbial communities under different nutrient conditions, while the one with biofilm consisted of more diversified populations and enriched Bacilli. Our finding provides novel insights about the environmental prerequisite for soil biofilm formation which sustain a diverse and robust community to impact soil biogeochemical processes.

The newly formed precipitates are important for remediation efforts of contaminated soils and in the modeling of natural geochemical cycling in sediments. Trace metal rich layered double hydroxides (LDHs) serve as an environmentally important example in contaminated soils, and they also have a variety of applications in materials science. Their formation in soils occurs at the mineral-water interface, can be kinetically rapid, and the reaction products can have solubility product constants lower than pure metal hydroxides. Though, there are few kinetic data obtained in real-time and at the molecular scale which identify precipitate formation. Our objective is to determine in real-time and at the molecular scale the kinetics and speciation of nickel (Ni) sorption on aluminium (Al)-rich clay minerals utilizing Quick-EXAFS spectroscopy. We hypothesized that LDHs would form in less than several hours in a phyllosilicate mineral system using a custom-built flow cell. Additionally, we employed wavelet transformation (WT) to help distinguish between LDH phases and single metal hydroxide phases. Using WT we provide evidence that nitrate or carbonate groups may remain adsorbed to the hydroxide interlayer, and those groups may appear as lighter backscattering components in the EXAFS spectra, producing a similar effect as Al in the WT plot. We report real-time Quick-EXAFS data which illustrate the rapid formation of Ni-Al LDH precipitates at the phyllosilicate mineral–water interface in a flow environment in as little as 31–40 min. These real-time data enhance our understanding of the kinetics of mineral–water interface processes, such as adsorption, dissolution, and precipitation, by illustrating their rapid and simultaneous occurrence in a dynamic environment and showing that precipitation and adsorption can occur on the same rapid timescale.

The Arizona-Sonora region is characterized by the presence of three metallogenetic belts of Au, Cu, and Au-Ag deposits. Therefore, the presence of historic and low volume artisanal mine tailings is commonly found along this area, near to human settlements and river basins. Mexican regulations for mining waste are becoming more severe but the abandoned mine waste like tailings are almost ignored. It is well known that, mine tailings are a source of PTEs, and acts spreading this element constantly to the environment in some cases for long time scales. According to the EPA, in USA and the INEC in Mexico, the most important contaminants includes: Sb, As, Be, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Ag, Pb, Se, Tl and Zn. Since the availability and toxicity of PTEs are strongly correlated to their chemical speciation, synchrotron techniques have become key tools for studying the biogeochemistry of PTEs in environmental matrixes such as plants, water and soils at atomic and molecular level. The principal techniques are μ-XRF (imaging & tomography), μ-XAS (chemical speciation and structure) and μ-FTIR, (interaction with organic molecules). In this work we use a combination of wet chemistry and synchrotron techniques in two sites polluted by mining activities, with the aim to improve the knowledge on the biogeochemistry of the most relevant PTEs present in the study site and determine if they represent a potential threat to the environment and human health. One of the oldest polluted sites affected by As and Pb, presents a naturally attenuation, since soluble fractions of As are low (12,500 mg Kg-1). Our results showed that the presence of arsenates like kankite (FeAsO4∙3.5H2O), can moderate As availability, by adsorption and lixiviation resistance.

It is persistent, highly volatile and is able to convert into methylmercury (MeHg), a strong human neurotoxic. MeHg is mainly released in the environment by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and is then biomagnified and bioaccumulated in the aquatic food web. Understanding the biotransformation processes of Hg by these microorganisms is thus a key for risk assessment in ecosystems and human health. Despite the discovery of genes hgcA and hgcB involved in bacterial Hg methylation, the way Hg is taken up, methylated and released by SRB is still unknown. Our aim is to clarify these mechanisms at the bacterial cell level to progress in the understanding of Hg metabolic pathways. For that, we have been studying an original SRB strain Pseudodesulfovibrio hydrargyri BerOc1, able to methylate and demethylate Hg, and the Desulfovibrio alaskensis G20 SRB strain, only able to demethylate MeHg. Importantly, we used a novel approach combining High Energy Resolution Fluorescence Detected – X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure spectroscopy (HERFD-XANES) at the Hg L~III~-edge to speciate Hg with high sensitivity and synchrotron nano-X-ray Fluorescence imaging (nano-XRF) to locate Hg and other elements at the bacterial cell level. Hg methylation/demethylation rates were also determined using multiple stable isotopic tracers (Me201Hg and 199Hg(II)) and Gaz Chromatography-ICP-MS (GC-ICP MS) after exposure to various inorganic Hg (IHg) and MeHg concentrations (from 10 ppb to 10 ppm) and various times. Results showed that mercury methylation rates decreased with increasing Hg concentration in contrast to MeHg demethylation, suggesting a saturation of the Hg methylation process. HERFD-XANES identified a tetracoordinated βHgS form as dominant Hg species for both strains exposed to IHg while MeHg-cysteine was also detected in BerOc1 for the lower IHg exposure in agreement with Hg methylation rates. During the demethylation process, various Hg- and MeHg-thiols were also identified for both strains. These results highlight the important role of S ligands in Hg biotransformation processes, even when bacteria are grown in non-sulfidogenic conditions. Interestingly, nano-XRF and kinetics studies also suggest excretion of (Hg, S)- containing biomolecules by the bacterial cell.

To clarify this question, our present study focuses on 3D mapping of heavy metals sorbed to cells, glycoconjugates that comprise the majority of EPS constituents, and Fe(III) mineral aggregates formed by the phototrophic Fe(II)-oxidizing bacteria Rhodobacter ferrooxidans SW2 using confocal laser scanning microscopy in combination with metal-specific fluorophores.

Statistical analysis revealed that all heavy metals tested showed relatively similar sorption behaviour that was affected by the presence of sorbed ferrous and ferric iron. Our results showed that in addition to the mineral surfaces, both bacterial cell surfaces and the glycoconjugates provided most of sorption sites for heavy metals. Simultaneously, ferrous and ferric iron ions competed with the heavy metals for sorption sites on the organic compounds. In summary, we have developed and applied highly selective and sensitive metal fluorescent probes for confocal laser scanning microscopy for mapping heavy metals in environmental biofilms and cell-EPS-mineral aggregates; the information obtained by the present approach using a microbial model system provides important information to better understand the interactions between heavy metals and biofilms, and microbial formed Fe(III) minerals and heavy metals in complex natural environments. The benefit of using metal fluorescent dyes in combination with CLSM imaging over other techniques such as electron microscopy is that environmental samples can be analysed in their natural hydrated state, avoiding artifacts such as aggregation from drying that is necessary for analytical electron microscopy. Correlation analysis of spatially resolved heavy metal distributions with EPS and biogenic minerals in their natural hydrated state will further our understanding of the behaviour of metals in environmental systems.

Whether Se is toxic or essential for plants has yet to be established. Plants are the main nutritional source of Se for humans and animals, and their Se content depends on the bioavailability of Se within the soil environment. An understanding of Se transformations and transport processes, is, thus, essential for assessing the bioavailability of Se in the environment. Adsorption/desorption of Se by soils has been identified as an important mechanism controlling Se levels in soil solution and natural waters. Whether or not precipitation/dissolution reactions are a mechanism that controls Se bioavailability is still not clear. Aluminum is ubiquitous in mineral soils, and through chemical weathering it is undergoes hydrolysis, forming Al precipitates. The conditions under which Al-Se minerals and noncrystalline Al-Se precipitates form is incomplete. Al-Se precipitates were prepared by adjusting the pH of Al(ClO4)3-SeO3 and Al(ClO4)3-SeO4 solutions to 3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5.

The precipitates were characterized by X-ray diffraction, FTIR spectroscopy, solid state 27Al NMR, X-ray absorption spectroscopy (Al and O K-edges, Se L-edge) and chemical methods. The study showed that both noncrystalline and crystalline Al-Se materials can form under ambient conditions and that the pH of the system was the overlying controlling factor.

Both two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) and synchrotron-radiation-based micro X-ray fluorescence (µ-XRF) spectromicroscopy were used to explore the binding site of Mo in soils. The results showed that both NPKM and M increased bioavailable Mo over 1.7-fold when compared to Control and NPK treatments. In the soil profile (0-80 cm), both NPKM and M also had a higher bioavailable Mo than Control and NPK treatments. Furthermore, bioavailable Mo was positively correlated with δ15 N and wheat yield, sugggesting a potential contribution of bioavailable Mo to nitrogen uptake by wheat. Quantification of nifH genes in response to long-term fertilization treatments indicated that both NPKM and M improved the abundance of nifH genes when compared to NPK treatment.DithioniteCitrate-Bicarbonate (DCB) and acid ammonium oxalate extractions suggested a significant increase of reactive iron.

Sediment loss in surface runoff has been frequently discussed as a primary transport path of P, and many scientists downplayed subsurface loss via tile drainage networks in the Midwestern agricultural systems. Concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP) and total P in dranage ditches can range from just detectable to many tenths of a mg /L in tile lines. Furthermore, the contribution of colloidal and particulate P can be as high as ~45% during high flow events. These concentrations and loads of P are more than enough to lead to eutrophication and algal production in downstream water bodies. As part of the Hypoxia Action Plan, the Midwestern states in the U.S. have recently developed a nutrient loss reduction strategy to reduce P losses from both point and non-point sources. There has been a great interest in understanding the mechanisms of subsurface P transport processes through tile lines. It was hypothesized that the subsurface accumulation of P in the intensively managed agricultural soils is contributing to the P loss from tile lines. Mollisols enriched in organic C, clays and metal oxides could effectively retain P but it is not clear how and how much P has transported through subsoils because of the poorly drainage characteristic. We explored the soil P speciation and physiochemical properties of P colloids in tile waters using experimental geochemistry is conjunction with zetasizer, dynamic light scattering, synchrotron based X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and P K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy. In this presentation, the depth sequence distribution of P, its reactivity and speciation and the colloidal Fe controlled subsurface P loss in the intensively managed agricultural soils in the Midwestern U.S. will be discussed.

G. Catalanob a Department of Earth Sciences, Biotechnology Institute & MnDRIVE, University of Minnesota - Twin Cities, USA b Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Washington University in St. Louis, USA txu@umn.edu Adsorption plays an essential role in geochemical reactions at environmental interfaces because it not only directly controls contaminant fate and nutrient availability in soils but also is an important precursor step in many other processes such as the nucleation of precipitates, microbial- or ligand-promoted dissolution of minerals, and surface-initiated redox reactions. Adsorption reactions occur in the mineral-water interfacial region, a chemical and structural transition zone where surface sites in multiple coordination states displaying distinct pH-dependent charging behaviour interact with both adsorbates and water. While general ion adsorption mechanisms and the effects of surface charge on interfacial reactions have been extensively studied, little is known about the role of water in affecting ion adsorption processes. In this study, resonant and non-resonant surface X-ray scattering measurements have been used to investigate how interfacial water responds to the addition of adsorbed arsenate at corundum (001)-water interfaces over a range of pH conditions. The surface of corundum (001) is terminated by doubly coordinated functional groups that are neutrally-charged over a wide pH range. In the absence of arsenate, our non-resonant X-ray reflectivity (XR) data show that interfacial water displays weak ordering on this surface and little variation in its structure is observed over the pH range of 5 to 9 in 0.01 M NaCl solution. This suggests that surface charging from functional group protonation and deprotonation is inadequate to induce extensive structural changes in interfacial water. In the presence of arsenate, resonant anomalous X-ray reflectivity (RAXR) analyses have been used to determine the arsenic distribution (i.e., surface coverage and location) as a function of total arsenate concentrations. This is then combined with XR measurements to isolate the interfacial water structure at each experimental condition. Our results show that interfacial water undergoes substantial restructuring upon arsenate adsorption, indicating that a charged adsorbate greatly affects the arrangement and order of interfacial water on this surface. In addition, the overall interfacial water structure varies proportionally with arsenate surface coverage, with adsorbed water sites moving closer to the surface and the extended layering of interfacial water showing reduced positional disorder as arsenate surface coverage increases. This systematic variations in interfacial water properties with increasing arsenate surface coverage are consistent with two distinct water structures (one near sites of adsorbed arsenate and the other on the pristine surface) that vary in proportion with arsenate surface coverage. These observations demonstrate that the adsorption of arsenate directly alters the structure of water near corundum (001) surfaces, possibly through the modification of the charge state of surface sites or by providing new sites to which water may hydrogen bond. Such adsorbate-induced restructuring of interfacial water may represent an overlooked energetic contribution to adsorption reactions, which may thus reveal a potentially new process affecting contaminant and nutrient fate in soil systems.

Batch experiments indicated that adsorption of V and Mo on soils were highly nonlinear and time-dependent, where V and Mo retention showed typical biphasic reaction kinetics. The stirred-flow experiments showed that both V and Mo adsorption consisted of a fast initial reaction, as indicated by the fact that effluent solute concentration was close to zero for the first few minutes. A stirred-flow multi-reaction model (MRM) which accounts for slow as well as fast reactions of the reversible and irreversible type was developed to describe V and Mo adsorption and desorption processes on soils. Based on model simulations and experimental tracer breakthrough curves (BTCs) results, we concluded that the proposed model is valid for stirred-flow conditions. The strong retardation and slow release behaviors of V and Mo from stirred-flow experiments were successfully described using the proposed stirred-flow MRM where retardation and irreversible reactions were necessary.

Although Tl(I) is highly toxic, its fate in soil has not been well understood. In soil environments, adsorption and desorption reactions predominately determine the mobility and availability of contaminants in soils. To understand the underlying mechanisms of Tl adsorption/desorption of soils, this study performed Tl(I) adsorption and desorption experiments on two groups of soil samples (i.e., permanent-charge and pH-dependent-charge soils), which have different mineralogical and physicochemical properties. The experimental results show that Tl(I) adsorption capacities of permanent-charge soils were higher than those of the pH-dependent-charge soils. The ratios of Tl(I) adsorption maximum to the corresponding cation exchange capacity (CEC) were determined to be 16 to 32% for pH-dependent-charge soils and up to 76% for permanent-charge soils. The results of Tl L3-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra suggest that the overall Tl(I) adsorption was mainly attributed to clay minerals including vermiculite, illite and smectite. Subsequently, the adsorption/desorption isotherms of each soil were fitted to Freundlich equation to evaluate the tendency of desorption as well as to calculate the hysteresis index. The permanent-charge soils exhibited greater degrees of the hysteresis effect in comparison to the pH-dependent-charge soils, indicating greater Tl mobility and availability of the pH-dependent-charge soils. To authors’ best knowledge, this is the first time that adsorption and desorption of Tl(I) were both investigated on soils. The results revealed the relatively high mobility of Tl(I) in soils, implying a high environmental risk of Tl(I) in soils.

With 7% of the Chinese soil samples exceeding soil environmental quality limits, Cd is the most prevalent heavy metal contaminant in Chinese soils according to a recent report. Cadmium is also an important contaminant in food crops e.g. rice, especially in southern China. As a staple food, rice is a major source of Cd intake for large numbers of people in China. Environmental factors including redox and soil pH can change Cd availability in paddy soils greatly and hence impact rice Cd absorption. To understand the impacts of flooding duration and soil amendments on Cd speciation and release kinetics in paddy soils, a series of soil incubation experiments were performed. The soil samples used in this study were collected from Hunan Province, China (total Cd concentration 2 mg kg-1, pH 5.8). All soil samples were spiked with CdCl2 to achieve a final concentration of 165 mg kg-1 to ensure the collection of high quality Cd extended x-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data. Three g CaCO3 and 1 g CaSO4 were added individually and in combination. The soil samples were aged for 4 weeks, and then incubated under moisture conditions for another 2 weeks before use. Soils were flooded for 1, 7, 30 or 120 days in reaction columns, drained to field moisture capacity and then immediately collected or cultured for another 5 days and prepared for further analysis. A stirred-flow kinetic method was conducted to determine desorption of Cd from different soil samples. Synchrotron-based techniques and linear combination fitting (LCF) were employed to identify and characterize Cd speciation in the soil samples. The results show that increasing flooding duration and using amendments both decreased the maximum amount of Cd desorption and the rate coefficient significantly. LCF of bulk EXAFS spectra of different samples indicated that most of the Cd was sorbed on minerals, while an increasing amount of CdS was found as the flooding duration increased. Furthermore, high and low Cd rice cultivars were grown in a pot experiment with the two amendments used in the soil incubation experiment. The results show that both CaCO3 and CaSO4 treatments lowered the Cd concentration in rice shoot and grain, with more reduction with CaCO3. These findings will aid in developing practical ways to reduce Cd accumulation in rice.

Here, we explored the effects of Mn2+, Ni2+ and Cu2+ on the evolution processes of hydrosulfate green rust (GR2) under various conditions and the mechanism of cations accumulation. The rates of formation and transformation of GR2 decrease in the order of Cu2+ > Ni2+ > Mn2+, and increase with increasing metal cation concentration. When GR2 forms completely, a portion of each cation enters the structure of GR2 by replacing Fe2+, and their amount follows the order of Cu2+ > Ni2+ > Mn2+. Under all conditions, the final products are a mixture of lepidocrocite and goethite; a slow mineral Fe2+ oxidation rate and a strong surface Fe2+ catalytic effects both facilitate the formation of goethite, conversely, favorable to lepidocrocite formation. Additionally, these three cations exhibits different speciation and spatial distribution in lepidocrocite and goethite: Mn mainly exists as Mn(III) and locates in the interior of the crystals; Ni(II) uniformly distributes in the minerals; Cu(II) with minor Cu(I) accumulated at the (sub)surface of the minerals; thus, the complexity of these cations entering the structure of iron oxides decreases in the order of Cu2+ > Ni2+ > Mn2+. These new insights into the interaction between GR2 and trace metal cations improve our understanding of Fe mineralogical properties and the environmental geochemical behaviors of the associated cations in redox alternating soils and sediments.

Interaction of fluoride and calcium carbonates is of importance in controlling the groundwater quality in Karst area with abundant limestone present. However, little is known about the reactivity and stability of fluoride with carbonates owning to the lack of molecular scale characterizations. In this study, we employed 19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to investigate the local molecular-scale environment of fluoride after reacted with calcite. At low F concentration (≤1mM, at pH8), we observed a single 19F NMR peak at -122 ppm; at high F concentration (≥2mM, at pH8), the 19F NMR spectra yield two peaks at -108 and -122 ppm, respectively. This indicates two different reaction products; the -108 ppm peak could be assigned to fluorite (CaF2), whereas the other peak at -122 ppm with FWHM of about 3 ppm were tentatively assigned to fluoride diffused or incorporated into calcite structure, which was further confirmed using Nano Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (NanoSIMS). Furthermore, High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM) equipped with Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED) characterization suggested the presence of a newly formed phase with distinct SAED pattern from that of calcite. Based on these results, a pseudomorphic replacement model can be proposed for interpreting F/calcite interaction, which are essential to understand the surficial interaction between anions and calcite and access the vulnerability of groundwater in carbonated layers (e.g. Karst).

However, Eh-coupled release mechanisms of Cd/As in contaminated paddy soils remains unclear. In this experiment, the combination of advanced microcosms and synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (μ-XRF) were applied to investigate the release mechanisms of As/Cd in the contaminated paddy soil at varied Eh conditions (-250, -50, 170 mV). The results indicated the concentrations of Cd, As, Al, S, P and Fe increased but DOC and pH decreased with the Eh increase from -250 mV to 170 mV. Cd/S/Al exhibited similar increasing pattern, with fast increase from -250 mV to -50 mV (Eh Range 1, EhR1), but slow increase from -50 mV to 170 mV (Eh Range 2, EhR2). However, As/Fe/P showed slow increase during EhR1 but fast increase during EhR2. Those suggested Cd and As were probably mainly correlated with sulfide oxidation and the reduction of Fe hydroxides during Eh changes, respectively. Moreover, μ-XRF analysis found As tended to overlap with Fe and S rather than K and Ca in the investigated soil for all Eh values, and the correlation coefficients of As-Fe and As-S were much higher at -250 mV and 170 mV compared to -50 mV. These results indicated As was probably associated with iron sulfide at low Eh condition but Fe hydroxides at high Eh condition. Collectively, iron sulfide was expected to be as the predominant sorbents for Cd/As sequestration at the low Eh condition, while the release of Cd was more sensitive to sulfide oxidation but that of As mainly depended on the reduction of Fe hydroxides with Eh changes from reducing to oxidation conditions. This study provides new insights on the co-release mechanisms of Cd/As in contaminated paddy soils, thus benefitting the control of rice contamination in paddy soils.

Electron mediators can stimulate the biofilm formation of Shewanella MR-1 so that enhanced the EET process. However, the way mediators influence the biofilm formation in a soil system is still unknown. Bioelectrochemical system (BES) is a promising technic to examine the in situ dynamics of EET by directly recording the microbial current generation. Hence, the effect of mediator was investigated in a soil BES, using 50 μM of 9,10-anthraquinone-2-sulfonic acid (AQS) as electron mediator. Results show that current generation was increased by AQS, implying an enhanced EET rate. The biofilm biomass, as indicated by the total protein extracted from the electrode, also increased. AQS changed the biofilm microbial community. 16s rDNA results show that Geobacter has the highest proportion in the system without AQS, while it substantially decreased in the system with AQS. Chao1 index increased in the system with AQS, suggesting that AQS promoted the microbial diversity. This change of community probably has contribution to the enhancing of biofilm formation.

It is indispensable to precisely understand the mechanisms of metal sorption reactions in the perspective of both geochemical processes and environmental remediation. The development of synchrotron radiation X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS) technique, an advanced analytical method, has made it possible to definitively discriminate among the sorption mechanisms at an atomic/molecular level. Extensive XAFS studies have been employed to investigate the mechanisms of heavy metals on traditional layer-structure types (e.g. 1:1 type such as kaolinite, and 2:1 type such as montmorillonite, illite, pyrophyllite), however, metal sorption on chain-structure clays, another significant kind of clays such as sepiolite and palygorskite, have barely been studied. Hence, a combination of X-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy (XAFS), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HTTEM), and diffused reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) is applied to examine the microscopic mechanisms in the Ni/palygorskite system and explore the contribution of mineral structures to metal sorption mechanisms. The results demonstrated that the mechanisms of Ni sequestration vary as a function of reaction time, pH, ionic strength, and temperature. At low pH and low ionic strength (e.g. below pH 7 and I=0.001 M), the sorption of Ni was dominated by outer-sphere surface complexation. This was confirmed by the interatomic the coordination numbers determined by XAFS. As pH and ionic strength increased, inner-sphere sutface complexation gradually became dominant. At higher pH and higher ionic strength (e.g. above pH 7.5 and I=0.1 M), the Ni-Ni distances (RNi-Ni=3.09 Å) determined by EXAFS suggested the formation of α–Ni(OH)2 type of precipitates, which was different from those of Ni-Al LDH (RNi-Ni=3.06 Å) and β–Ni(OH)2 (RNi-Ni=3.13 Å). Wavelet transform analysis of XAFS data and DRS characterization further confirmed this result. Ni-rich surface precipitates formed with the initial Ni concentration as low as 0.07mM, with the sorption densities of Γ=0.09 μmol m-2, which corresponds to a 0.3% monolayer coverage for palygorskite. This observation is to our surprise because surface precipitates would not form at montmorillonite and γ-Al2O3 at this low level of Ni concentration. The comparation of Ni sorption mechanisms on palygorskite, sepiolite, montmorillonite and γ-Al2O3 revealed that for both the Ni/palygorskite and Ni/sepiolite systems, the sorption isotherms exhibited as linear shape and the precipitate phases were determined to be α–Ni(OH)2 precipitates, which significantly differed from the Ni/montmorillonite and Ni/γ-Al2O3 systems, indicating the similarity and uniqueness of the palygorskite-sepiolite group, both of which are a typical kind of chain-structure phyllosilicates.

According to a recent worldwide survey of median urinary iodine, 11 countries around the world have an excess of iodine intake, which can trigger iodine toxicity disorders (IED) and cause immune responses such as autoimmune thyroiditis. In China, excessive iodine intake is widespread, with approximately 31 million people in 11 provinces affected. Our previous studies found the occurrence of high iodine groundwater in the Datong basin and North China Plain, which increases hypothyroidism risk for residents using the groundwater as the main source of drinking water. However, the current understanding of the hydrochemical cycling of iodine in the groundwater systems is very limited. Our previous studies found that iodine concentration in groundwater can be up to 1187 µg/L at the Datong basin. In the basin, the iodine-loaded metal (oxy)hydroxides are considered as an primary hosts of soil/sediment iodine, and dissimilatory reduction of metal (oxy)hydroxides would lead to iodine mobilization from sediment into groundwater. Therefore, in order to better understand the iodine mobilization in this groundwater system, a series of batch incubation experiments investigating the transformation of iron minerals were performed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Two sediment samples of DXZ04 and DXZ147 at depths of 4.35 m and 281 m, respectively, were collected from the iodine-affected area of the Datong basin to perform the batch incubation experiments which involved the iron reducer Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. Iron K-edge X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) and PHREEQC (Version 3, 3.4.0-12927) were used to identify the transformation of Fe phases and iodine species, respectively. The results showed that for the shallow sediment DXZ04, after treatment with the iron reducer MR-1 and Na-lactate (used as an electron donor for MR-1), iodine release from sediment into solution was observed under anaerobic conditions compared with no evident release of iodine under aerobic conditions. The redox-derived transformation of sediment Fe phases from the crystalline Fe to HCl-extractable Fe phases was considered as the main factor causing the iodine release. For the untreated deep sediment DXZ147, a higher ratio of HCl-extractable Fe fraction to natural sediment Fe phases was observed. Consistently, the groundwater from the deep aquifer had the higher iodine concentrations (up to 732 µg/L) than the shallow aquifer, suggesting that the long-term transformation of Fe minerals under the reducing conditions of the deep aquifer led to iodine mobilization from the sediment into the groundwater. In addition, during the iodine release, the transformation of iodine species from organic iodine or iodate to iodide further promotes its mobilization. The evidence gained from this study provides new insights on the genesis of natural high iodine groundwater.

The results show that the lake has experienced serious Tl pollution during the past 60 years, owing to a large influx of Tl-bearing wastes from a Cu smelter nearby. The distribution pattern of Tl contents in the sediment core correlated well with the production scale of Cu smelting activities. Further analysis by electronic microscopy and X-ray diffraction suggested that Tl was found mainly bound to quartz and alumino-phyllosilicates in both electrostatic dust of the Cu smelter and representative highly-polluted sediments from the depth profile. In addition, SEM-EDS analysis implied that a fraction of Tl was also frequently present in diatom frustules of the sediments.

The majority of laboratory-based studies have focused attention on one or two trace elements within soil or water systems; what is desperately lacking are focused studies with the use of biochar for metal sorption in mixed metal matrices (e.g., matrices that might be found in urban or environmental runoff). We focused attention on the use of five different biochars for trace/heavy metal sorption in a mixed solution phase – solutions contained varying amounts of biochar in the presence of varying concentrations of Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb, Al, and Fe (we are currently adding Cr, Ni, and Hg into the solution matrix). Our intent was to quantify sorption phenomenon and maximum metal sorption in the presence of other potentially competing metal ions. Results show that biochar-heavy metal sorption varied considerably based, likely on, inherent biochar properties. However, some of the best performing biochars resulted in sorption of Al and Cu up to ~ 680 and 1140 mg/kg, respectively. These high-performing biochars linearly sorbed Cd, Fe, Pb, and Zn up to 100, 1400, 800, and 1200 mg/kg, respectively, with sorption maximum not yet met.

However, many wetland soils are polluted with toxic elements such as arsenic, cadmium, mercury, antimony and others. In particular, paddy soil are very vulnerable since they serve as producer of food, including rice. Paddy soils are regularly flooded and thus, they underlie large fluctuations of redox conditions. Those changes of redox conditions have considerable impacts on the biogeochemical behavior of toxic elements as well as on pH, carbonate, and carbon solubility, chemistry of iron, manganese, and sulfur as well as on microbial community, which control the mobilization of toxic elements. Doubtless, the redox potential and pH are master variables in governing those mobilization processes. We are able to conduct experiment in the laboratory to study mechanistically the release dynamics of toxic elements. Also, we are seek for suitable amendments to stabilize those toxic metals in the soil which should be stabile even under dynamic redox conditions. Biochar is considered as one option to fulfill this purpose. Various results gained at several scales (microscale, laboratory and field scale) will be presented.

We aimed to elucidate the impact of pre-definite EH on the release dynamics of dissolved and colloidal concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Mo, Ni, and Zn as well as their phytoavailability and potential mobility in the solid-phase of a mining soil treated with rice hull biochar (S+BC) compared to non-treated soil (S). The influence of EH-dependent changes of soil pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved aromatic carbon (DAC), Fe, Mn, SO42-, and Cl- on the elements release was also determined. The experiment was conducted stepwise from reducing (-30 mV in S and -12 mV in S+BC) to oxidizing (+218 mV in S and +333 mV in S+BC) conditions using an automated biogeochemical microcosm system. Biochar-treated soil exhibited a wider range of EH and a lower pH than the non-treated soil. Cadmium and Co was more abundant in the colloidal fraction, while As, Cu, Mn, Mo, and DOC were more abundant in the dissolved fraction. Nickel, Zn, and Fe distributed almost equally in both fractions. Dissolved concentrations of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Zn, Fe, Mn, SO42-, and DAC increased under oxic conditions in the non-treated and biochar-treated-soil, which might be due to the oxidation of the elements to a more soluble species, decline of pH, and/or sulfide oxidation. Biochar increased the dissolved concentration of As, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, and Zn, in particular Cu under oxic conditions. However, the biochar did not significantly affect the colloidal fraction of Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, and Zn. The phytoavailability of the studied elements was higher than the potential mobility. We conclude that increasing the dissolved concentrations of the elements under oxic conditions might increase their release and transfer into the groundwater and the food chain which should be harmful for the environment. Application of such rice hull biochar to this soil might increase the metal release under oxic conditions, which might increase the environmental and health risks in such wetland ecosystems.

However, major challenges still remain unresolved for field applications of nZVI. High-energy mechanical ball milling (BM) is an easy-to-operate, low-cost and efficient solid-state powder processing technique. No studies have been reported about the preparation of ball milled nZVI-biochar and mechanism on the effectiveness of Cr(VI) removal by ball milled nZVI-biochar have been investigated. A novel Fe0@biochar was synthesized by ball milling method for the first time and tested for Cr(VI) removal in aqueous solution. FTIR, SEM, TEM, XRD was used to characterize the properties of the composite. Longer ball milling time and acidic condition were favorable for Cr(VI) removal. Biochar pyrolysis temperature had a significant impact on Cr(VI) removal, and removal efficiency improved from 49.6% to 97.8% when pyrolysis temperature varied from 300℃ to 700℃. Graphene structure in biochar at higher pyrolysis temperature acting as electron conductor promoted electron transfer from Fe0 to Cr(VI). The main removal mechanisms were adsorption by functional groups, electrostatic interaction and subsequently reduction. Ball mill could depassivate the Fe0@biochar for its regeneration on Cr(VI) removal. Comparing with traditional preparation method for Fe0@biochar, ball milling avoided the contamination of chemicals and the preparation conditions were easy to realize, which is environmental friendly and economic. The composite could also be regenerated by ball milling after several cycles of usage. Therefore, the ball milled Fe0@biochar composite had a promised prospect in field application as reactive barrier for ground water remediation.

Iron secondary minerals, as an important sink of contaminants, are common in sediments and floodplain soils. Stable transition metal isotopes have emerged as new tools to examine the sources and mechanisms controlling the cycle of trace elements in rivers and soils. In this study, we investigated the sorption of different crystallization structure of iron (III) oxyhydroxides by combining Cd adsorption isotherms at acidic condition, to quantify the magnitude of Cd stable isotope fractionation during adsorption process and to constrain the molecular mechanism responsible for fractionation in this system. At pH=6, significant Cd adsorption to both minerals surface was observed while all the Cd existed in the dissolved phase at pH=4. The amount of Cd adsorbed on iron oxyhydroxides between low and high ionic strength was not obvious, and Cd adsorbed on mineral surface could drive an isotopic offset between solution and solids, with isotopically light Cd preferentially sorbed (δ114/110Cd~NIST\\ 3108~ from -0.49‰ to -0.13‰). Cd signatures was constant as a function of the fraction of total Cd sorbed, indicating a reversible equilibrium isotope effect. The small difference of ∆114/110Cd~solution-solid~ between the two ionic strengths with same iron oxyhydroxide indicates similar mechanisms driving Cd isotope fractionation. The Cd isotope composition of different iron oxyhydroxides were slightly indistinguishable. Those shifts may result from the structure and crystallinity difference. At high ionic strength, the presence of SO42- dramatically promoted Cd adsorption, suggesting the formation of Cd-SO42- ternary surface complexes on goethite. In this circumstance, we observed that the δ114/110Cd of solid phase increased from -0.39 ‰ to -0.13 ‰, and the light δ114/110Cd of solid phase attenuated implied that the increased content of Cd was derived from heavy δ114/110Cd of the solution. Our findings emphasize the importance of inorganic ligands complexation in metal isotope sorption studies. Cadmium stable isotopes may be a novel tool for determining geochemical attenuates processes in river and soil environments.

In this study, we investigated the influence of short cycle of dry-wet repetition of soil on greenhouse gas emission, together with biochar which is expected to suppress greenhouse gas emission. Materials and methods Incubation experiment was carried out with Andosols and Chernozems soil collected in Japan and Hungary, respectively. Biochar (derived from rice husk, commercially available in Japan, pyrolysis at 600 to 800 ℃ for 5 minutes) was applied at the rate of 0% or 1%(w/w) of oven dried soil. Nitrogen fertilizer was applied to all treatments (100 kg N ha⁻¹). Moist soil equivalent to 10g oven-dried soil was filled in closed bottles, and aerobically incubated for 12 weeks at 20oC in dark place. The moisture was kept constant during the incubation period (CM; Water Holding Capacity (WHC) at 60%) or subjected to 6 cycles of drying and wetting (DW: WHC was decreased from 60% to 30% in one week by silica gel).

Since small spot sizes improve the resolution a high sensitive detection is key for this kind of applications. With the high sensitivity ICP-MS allows the use of smaller spot-sizes to improve the resolution and precision. The Tandem LA – LIBS instrument provides the unique capability of combining the analytical benefits of both LA-ICP-MS (Laser Ablation-Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry) and LIBS (Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy). LIBS can be used for the analysis of H – Pu, which includes non-metals such as H, N, O, and halogens that are difficult or impossible to analyze by a conventional ICP-MS instrument. When coupled with an ICP-MS instrument, it can perform LA-ICP-MS measurements focusing on trace elemental and isotopic ratio compositions.

In this study, the electron transfer processes during the reduction of Cr(VI) by biochar produced at different temperatures were evaluated. Biochar derived from peanut shell at 400-800oC could effectively reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), and the reduction capability showed the decrease as the pyrolysis temperature increased from 400oC to 600oC, and then increase from 600oC to 800oC. The electron donating moieties of biochar experienced a transition from the O-containing functional groups, especially –OH in the form of phenol or alcohol at lower pyrolysis temperature (oC) to conjugated π-electron systems associated with aromatic structure at higher temperature (>600oC). Biochar could mediate the reduction of Cr(VI) by small molecular weight organic acid in soil such as lactate, oxalate, etc., enhancing both extent and reaction rate of Cr(VI) reduction. The reaction rate of Cr(VI) by biochar and lactate together was up to 16.3 and 345 times higher than that by either biochar or lactate alone, respectively. The mediation capability of biochar increased with pyrolysis temperature from 400oC to 800oC, which was due to the increased electrical conductivity of biochar related to the growth of aromatic clusters. Our results indicated that oxygen-containing functional groups and aromatic structure of biochar, which were greatly affected by pyrolysis temperature, could facilitate the electron donating and mediating processes in the reduction of Cr(VI), and thus influencing the transformation and fate of Cr in the environment.

Antimony compounds are released into the environment through mining, smelting activities, combustion of fossil fuels and spent ammunition. Mobilization of Sb due to mining activities is often associated with highly acidic condition. Environmental fate of Sb in water depends on different factors such as pH, redox potentials and other environmental conditions. Two predominant forms of Sb present in water as oxyanions of which tri-valent Sb (Sb(III)) tends to bind more strongly in neutral and alkaline soils than pentavalent Sb (Sb(V)). However, the sorption of Sb(V) from aqueous solution can be significant at low pH. Biochar, a solid by-product of bio-refineries, is an emerging low-cost sorbent for environmental contaminants. In this study, three biochar products were investigated for their efficacy to sequester Sb(V), including biosolid (BS), cow manure (CM) and horse manure (HM) biochar. Slow pyrolysis (300 °C, 30 min) was employed at a 7 °C min–1 heating rate for biochar production. Among the three biochars, the biosolid biochar was modified with zirconyl chloride solution (biochar: solution = 1:10) as it was hypothesized that the modification will enhance the sorption capacity. The sorption behavior of Sb(V) on BS, CM and HM biochar was investigated using batch sorption techniques (sorbent dosage 2.5 g/L, temperature 25 °C). The sorption isotherms and pH edges indicated that the affinity of Sb(V) toward the BS biochar was strongly dependent on solution pH and biochar characteristics. Sorption of Sb(V) was favored at pH 1.0–2.0 as a consequence of the high affinity between the positively charged biochar surface and the predominant Sb species (Sb(OH)6– and Sb(OH)50). Increasing pH (4.0–8.0) resulted in a dramatic decrease in the sorption (0–5% sorption of Sb(V)) efficiency. The Langmuir isotherm model described experimental data well for Sb(V) (R2 = 0.97). The maximum sorption capacity (Qm) of BS, CM and HM biochars at pH 2.0 were 10.15, 4.06 and 4.94 mg/g, respectively. Zirconium (IV) modified biosolid biochar (ZMBS) enhanced Sb(V) sorption by 3 fold greater than the unmodified biochar. In this investigation, ZMBS performed well at pH 3.0–5.0 (maximum Sb removal efficiency found at pH 4.0). ZMBS was not effective below pH 3.0. Thus, the unmodified BS biochar shows that it has a great potential in removing Sb(V) from acidic aqueous environments such as groundwater and acid mine drainage, whilst ZMBS would be more suitable for less acidic waters, the more commonly encountered environment. Further research on the chemical modification of BS biochar is required to enhance the Sb(V) removal efficiency.

In this study, biochars from various pyrolysis temperatures were ball milled and tested for enrofloxacin (EFA) photocatalytic degradation and mechanisms. Ball-milled biochar could generate more •O2- under visible light irradiation, which favored the photocatalytic degradation of EFA. The ball-milled biochar pyrolyzed at 300 ℃ (BM300) exhibited the highest EFA degradation rate (66.3% compared to 13.9% for unmilled biochar). Characterization results suggested that the higher specific surface area and smaller particles size facilitated the adsorption of EFA molecules, while the abundant defects, more oxygen functional groups and persistent free radicals (PFRs) played significant role in the generation of reactive oxygen radicals (ROS), which benefited the enhancement of photocatalytic performance. Radical trapping experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique confirmed that •O2- and h+ were the main active species in the photocatalytic degradation process.

However, most studies focused only on soils contaminated mainly with metals such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), manganese (Mn), aluminum (Al), iron (Fe) and copper (Cu). Moreover, the main mechanism for their decline is reported as the adsorption by biochar and their decreased mobility at higher pH induced by biochar addition. However, we hypothesized that the application of biochar in neutral soil with elevated content of arsenic (As) could increase mobility of this element. To achieve the objective, we have included three soils having different As, Cd and Mn contents. The selected soils are Luvisol (pH = 7.0, high content of As), Cambisol (pH = 4.5, high content of Mn), and Fluvisol (pH = 5.9, high Cd and Mn contents). Selected soils were incubated for 56 days in controlled conditions with four elevating rates of biochar (0.5, 2, 4 and 8% w/w). Each treatment was set up in three replicates, irrigated to 60% of maximum water holding capacity every other day and samples were collected at 7th, 14th, 28th and 56th day of incubation and extracted with 0.01 M CaCl2 (1:10 w/v) for the determination of available As, Cd and Mn contents. The application of biochar increased available As content in Luvisol. The increment was significant especially at biochar application rate of 8% at the 56th day of incubation, while insignificant increment was found in other treatments. The increment in available As content of Luvisol is mainly attributed by higher original soil As content, the increment in the soil pH by biochar addition and the higher As mobility at higher pH. While in the rest soils (Cambisol and Fluvisol) available As content was below detection limit of inductive coupled plasma–optical emission spectrometer, ICP–OES). The availability of both Cd and Mn significantly declined after the addition of 2, 4 and 8% of biochar application rates at both Cambisol and Fluvisol at all sample collection periods. The decline in available content of Cd and Mn mainly raised from the increment in pH of both soils. In Luvisol it was only 8% of biochar application, which induced a significant decline in available Cd content and mostly inconsistent effect on available Mn content was found. This low effect of biochar on Cd and Mn content at Luvisol was probably due to very low soil content of these elements. Generally, biochar was able to induce increment in available As content ranging from 3.3 to 32%, decline in available Cd content ranging from 69 to 82% and decline in available Mn content ranging from 69 to 89%. The changes were substantially affected by soil type and properties of soils. Biochar could induce the decline in available soil Cd and Mn content, while increase the available As content. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate As content of soils before considering biochar as heavy metal remediation tool at contaminated soils. Finally, we would like to put our remark on further investigation of biochar effect on the mobility of trace elements, with especial emphasis given to the soil As content.

Tlustoš Department of Agro-Environmental Chemistry and Plant Nutrition, Czech University of Life Sciences, Czech Republic. szakova@af.czu.cz The current knowledge on the behavior of biochars in soil is ambiguous and the soil-biochar interaction depends on many factors including soil properties, biochar composition, specific surface, porosity, pyrolysis temperature, etc. In this study, five samples of biochar have been produced at different temperatures (300, 350, 400, 450 and 500 °C) from one type of feedstock (woodfillings). Consequently, the laboratory incubation experiment has been carried out with application of 2 % of biochar into two different types of soil for four weeks, where the soil samples were collected and analyzed weekly. The Mehlich III soil extraction procedure was applied for the assessment of the accessible portions of the nutrients, where atomic spectrometry was used for element determination in the extracts. A determination of the essential elements in the biochars (Ca, Cu, K, Mg, P, S, Zn) showed that the rising temperature increased the content of these elements in the pyrolyzed matter. It was due to the concentration effect of the pyrolysis, because the amount of the produced biochar decreased with increasing pyrolysis temperature. Under 500°C of pyrolyzed temperature, the biochar yield from the same amount of feedstock represented only 60 % of mass compared to the biochar prepared at 300°C. Based on the incubation experiment, it was found that an addition of 2 % of biochar did not increase the pH of slightly acid soils used in the experiment, in spite of the alkaline character of biochar. Therefore, it was found out that although the nutrient contents in biochars increased, the extractable proportions tended to decrease with increasing pyrolysis temperature. For most of the nutrients determined (except Cu and K), the results indicated better extractability of the nutrients in the soil treated with the biochar prepared at 300°C, and, on the contrary, opposite pattern was observed for the biochar prepared at 500°C. Moreover, the fate of extractable nutrient proportions differed according to the soil type and the course of incubation. Whereas the extractable proportions of nutrients dropped down in most of cases after one week of incubation in the slightly acidic (pH = 5.8) Luvisol with moderate level of cation exchange capacity (CEC = 116 mmol+/kg), the extractable contents of nutrients in the less acidic (pH = 6.4) Fluvisol characterized by low CEC (55.6 mmol+/kg) remained unchanged during the experiment, even increased in the end of incubation, as observed most apparently for S. The huge number of literature sources showed that the biochar alters the nutrient balance in the soil, and simultaneously can be considered as a source of nutrients such as Ca, P and K. However, these results confirmed that the potential ability of biochar to enhance the soil nutrient status is affected by many factors connected with both soil and biochar characteristics, where the fate of biochar-bearing nutrients in the particular soils still remains hardly predictable.

Fana,b, S.N. Lina, Y.W. Houb and C. Caia* a Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences b Huaqiao University yczhang@iue.ac.cn Cd pollution of soils becomes a global environmental issue, binging in increasing damage to food safety and human health. Biochar can retain metal ions via surface complexation, adsorption, electrostatic interaction etc, and is considered as cost-efficient soil amendment for Cd contamination. However, with the change of environmental factors like pH and water condition, metal ions adsorbed on biochars may be released. In this study, a thiol-modified biochar(T-RSBC) was prepared in order to strengthen the metal retention capacity of rice straw biochar, since the thiol group could form the stable complex with metal ions (like Hg2+ and Cd2+). And the Cd adsorption capacity of T-RSBC was investigated in the batch experiment and soil reactor experiment. Results indicated that the total S content of T-RSBC was increased from 0.98%(RSBC) to 24.0%, and the content of available thiol group tested by Ellman method was increased to 0.80 mmol/g. In addition, the results of FTIR, SEM-EDS and XPS were also confirmed the successful loading of thiol group onto RSBC. The adsorption of Cd2+ ion onto T-RSBC reached equilibrium within 6 hours. In the pH 5 buffer solution system, the saturated adsorption capacity of Cd ion of T-RSBC was 48.1 mg/g, which was 5.7 folds as that of RSBC. After amended into soils, the concentrations of DPTA extracted Cd of soils were significantly decreased to 60.8% - 65.2% in the T-RSBC treatments, which were lower than those in the RSBC treatments (80.0% - 96.3%). In addition, the TCLP extracted Cd of soils were decreased to 82.1% - 86.3% of that in the control treament. The results of Tessier sequential extraction indicated the amendment of T-RSBC decreased the content of carbonate bonding Cd in soils, and increased the contents of Fe-Mn (hydro)oxide bonding- and organic bonding Cd in soils, which lead to the decrease of mobility and bioavailability of Cd. In conclusion, the loading of thiol group onto rice straw biochar increased the interaction between Cd2+ ion and biochar, and improved the remediation of Cd pollution of soils. Our study developed a novel thiol-modified rice straw biochar as soil amendment for cadmium pollution, which provided scientific support for the remediation of soil contamination.

China libingyu2084@stu.hunau.edu.cn The aromatic organoarsenic compounds (e.g., roxsarsone) has been widely used in breeding industry as feed additives in China for decades. Due to its poorly metabolized by livestocks, roxsarsone (ROX) is excreted in original form through animal urine and feces. After being released into environment, ROX can be transformed into carcinogenic inorganic arsenic (As) species via biotic and abiotic reactions in natural environments, which lead to the widespread contamination of farmland soil and aquatic ecosystems. Thus, the exploitation of effective measures for the rapidly and safely elimnation of organoarsenic compounds are of significant urgency. In this study, bi-functionalized sludge-based biochar supported nano zero-valent iron (NZVI-SBC) composites have been successfully synthesized through simply modified liquid phase reduction method. Characterization results (e.g., SEM, TEM and XPS) manifested that NZVI has been succesfully incorporated into the biochar bulk martrix. Adsorption batch experiments revealed that NZVI-SBC has a unexpected higer adsorption capacity (up to 2500 mg/g at 318.15K) than the pristine biochar. Kinectics studies uncovered that removal processes of ROX followed a pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the adsorption behavior was highly pH dependent. Based on the results of UV-VIS spectra, FTIR, XPS, LC-AFS and UHPLC-QTOF-MS, the synergistic effect of adsorption and degradation was the pivotal factor for the unexpected higher adsorption capacity towards to ROX by NZVI-SBC. In review of all the experiment data, the removal mechanisms are, therefore, speculated that the attack of As-C bond by hydroxyl radical which generated from the NZVI corrosion in aqueous solutions, which determinated the higer removal capacity of NZVI-SBC for ROX. This study demonstrated that NZVI-SBC has great potential for the remediation of organoarsenic compounds contaminated wastewater.

However, studies on the redox properties of pyrogenic carbon have, until recently, been concerned with the development of electrochemical quantification methods. In this study, we investigated the redox properties of pyrogenic carbon and its enhanced performance in a microbial extracellular electron transfer system when it is functionalized with oxygen (HNO3 oxidation) or nitrogen (pyrolysis in NH3 atmosphere)-containing functional groups. Both oxygen-functionalized and N-doped pyrogenic carbons promoted the rate and extent of ferrihydrite reduction by Shewanella oneidensis MR-1. For the oxygen-functionalization, it increased the electron exchange capacity (EEC) of pyrogenic carbon, which was responsible for the enhancement of the microbial reduction of ferrihydrite. This conclusion was supported by the presence of quinone/hydroquinone groups and strongly positively correlation between the EEC and the content of C=O groups. For the N-doping, it increased the EEC and the electrochemical capacitance of pyrogenic carbon, which were responsible for the enhanced ferrihydrite reduction. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, electrochemical, and electron paramagnetic resonance analyses suggested the increase in the pyrrolic-N and pyridinic-N group contents in pyrogenic carbon played a dominant role in elevating the EEC and the electrochemical capacitance of pyrogenic carbon, and finally the rate for ferrihydrite reduction. The improved electron transfer rate due to surface functionalization favors the environmental and agronomic applications of pyrogenic carbon from a biogeochemical redox perspective. Microbial reduction of arsenic (As)-bearing Fe(III)-(oxyhydr)oxides is one of the major processes for the release of As in various environmental settings such as acid mine drainage, groundwater, and flooded paddy soil. Then, the fate and transformation of As during pyrogenic carbon facilitated microbial reduction of As-bearing ferrihydrite were investigated. Our results show that the pyrogenic carbon facilitated reduction caused the release of As(III) into the solution, whereas it caused the preferential immobilization of As(V) on the solid phase. Furthermore, pyrogenic carbon accelerated the precipitation of vivianite and siderite in sequence during microbial reduction processes. Both of the formed vivianite and siderite had an insignificant capacity for capturing As(III); however, As(V) was selectively immobilized by vivianite compared to that of siderite. Taken together, our findings provide crucial insights into understanding the role of pyrogenic carbon on the redox and immobilization of Fe and As in suboxic and anoxic environments and thus their environmental fate when it is employed for agronomic and environmental applications.

Nagasawa a, T. Tanimichi b and K.

The Global Warming Potential (GWP) of CH4 is about 25 times than that of CO2 (IPCC, 2007). CH4 emission from paddy soil will changed by the fertilizer we used. A pot experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of application of slag fertilizer (Material M) and biochar on methane emission, soil chemical property (pH) and rice growth, yields. MATERIALS AND METHODS The pot experiment was conducted from May 13 to September 21, 2018. Three kg sandy soil was placed into plastic pot (3L), five treatments were set up as allows: (1) NPK (39kg/10a); (2) NPK＋slag fertilizer (200kg/10a); (3) NPK＋biochar (1%); (4) NPK＋slag fertilizer (200kg/10a)＋biochar (1%); (5) soil only, all with 3 replications and three rice seedlings. All with top dressing twice with urea (0.125g) at Day 41-51 with mid-drainage. CH4 flux was measured by closed chamber method and gas chromatograph, soil pH was measured with pH meter. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Soil pH after harvesting was increased by slag fertilizer and biochar, because slag fertilizer and biochar contains alkaline. Soil Total C increased by biochar, which is considered to contribute to carbon sequestration. Total N was not significantly different in each treatment. There was also a tendency that the soil solution pH increased in slag fertilizer and biochar treatments, but there was not much difference. Total CH4 emission during crop season from slag fertilizer treatment decreased about 28% compared with NPK treatment, biochar treatment decreased about 35% compared with NPK treatment, slag fertilizer＋biochar treatment decreased about 47% compared with NPK treatment. Panicle number and tiller number increased compared with chemical fertilizer treatment. Combined application of slag fertilizer and biochar also increased the field grain. Interaction to trace elements is discussed.

Wisawapipatb a Institute of Biogeochemistry and Pollutant Dynamics, ETH Zurich, Switzerland b Department of Soil Science, Kasetsart University, Thailand iso.christl@env.ethz.ch Biochars have been proposed as soil amendments based on research indicating beneficial effects of biochar addition on various processes such as trace element retention, mitigating greenhouse gas emission, and increasing carbon sequestration in soil. In particular, acidic soil exhibiting low cation exchange capacities and low base saturation percentages were found to be ameliorated by biochar additions. In tropical regions, strongly weathered acidic soil such as ferralsols and acrisols are very abundant. In Southeast Asia, acidic soils are often used for growing oil palms, which are fairly tolerant to acidic conditions and elevated Al concentrations in soil solution. Often acidic soils are also used for rice production, being the staple food in Southeast Asia. In this study, we aimed at assessing the suitability of biochars produced from economic crop residues as soil amendments for acidic soils in Thailand. Rice and oil palm residues were selected as the feedstock materials for biochar production. Dialysis and acid-washing were applied to reveal the contribution of the charred carbonaceous solids in biochars to their reactivity as compared to the untreated biochars containing inorganic solids. Two well-characterized biochars produced from rice straw and chestnut wood were included as reference materials. Titration experiments revealed a trend in reactivity of the biochars with respect to cation binding of the charred carbonaceous solids in the following order: rice straw>oil palm fruit fibre>rice chaff>>oil palm shell. The reactivities were highly related to the amounts of carboxylic carbon of the biochars as determined with FTIR spectroscopy. Acid-soluble solid phases contained in the non-treated biochars substantially contributed to the total reactivity. Their share was strongly related to the intensities of C-O out of plane deformation IR band of carbonates indicating that solid carbonates are major reactant phases in biochars. Compared to reactivities reported for humic materials, the values measured for all biochars investigated here were low. Consequently, the investigated biochars have to be applied in high quantities to make the biochars substantially contribute to trace element sorption in soil. As the carbonates contained in biochars can additionally support trace element retention in soils by increasing soil pH and by acting as a sorbent we conclude that carbonate-rich biochars are preferably suited as amendments for acidic tropical soils contaminated with cationic trace elements such as Cd2+, Cu2+, and Pb2+.

Kumpienea a Waste Science and Technology, Luleå University of Technology, Sweden b Department of Sustainable Development, Environmental Science and Engineering, KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden alfreda.kasiuliene@ltu.se Adsorption is a commonly used method to treat groundwater contaminated with trace elements (TE). A lot of low-cost adsorbents from agricultural waste, industrial by-products and natural and modified materials are being developed and applied to contaminated water. However, seldom spent sorbent is safely handled afterwards and often end up in landfill, thus creating new problems and posing new risks to humans and environment. To overcome this issue, pre-treatment of spent sorbents prior final deposit might be necessary. As an alternative to traditional thermal methods, e.g. combustion or pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) opens possibility to treat wet waste streams, without the need for an energy-intensive drying before or during the process. Hydrothermal carbonization is a wet, relatively low temperature (180-350 °C) process where, under autogenous pressures, biomass undergo a chain of reactions, including hydrolysis, dehydration, decarboxylation, condensation polymerization, and aromatization. Recently, HTC has received attention as a method for producing low-cost carbon-based nano-compounds used for fertilization, soil amelioration, and carbon sequestration in soil. However, application of HTC for complex waste streams, such as spent sorbents, is little explored. Basic published trends show that major part of inorganics remain with the hydrochar, but in general, behaviour of compounds, like TE, during the HTC is largely unknown. The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of using HTC as a treatment method for spent iron-peat sorbents, highly enriched with TE. Physical, chemical and thermal properties of the hydrochar were evaluated after the HTC treatment. Spent iron-peat sorbent with high loads of arsenic (As) (1 g kg-1), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) (up to 4 g kg-1) was hydrolysed at 230 °C (420 PSI) for three hours. Determination of the major elements, calorific value, and sequential extraction were performed with the obtained hydrochar. While dissolved carbon, density, and total elemental composition were analysed for the aqueous phase. The calorific value of the hydrochars increased by at least 30% as compared to HTC-untreated spent sorbent. Obtained hydrochar showed similar calorific value of coal. More than 99% of total adsorbed Cr, Cu and Zn remained in the hydrochar but nearly 30% of As was transferred to aqueous phase. Dissolved organic content substantially increased in the aqueous phase because of a high content of degradation products such as sugars, organic acids, and aromatics. Hydrothermal carbonization as a treatment method for spent sorbents with high TE loads is promising. However, environmental and practical implications associated with the evolved gases and composition of the aqueous phase needs further investigation.

Wang and L. Yan Research Center for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China cyjing@rcees.ac.cn Antimony (Sb) has been an underappreciated element of environmental concern, until the last decade. The ever-increasing industrial activities such as mineral exploration and extraction liberate extremely high concentrations of Sb. Improved awareness of Sb exposure pathways and toxicity has motivated recent studies on the biogeochemistry of Sb. Nevertheless, compared with arsenic, an element in the same group in the periodic table, Sb biotransformation and mobility in the environment are much less understood. Sb exists mainly in two oxidation states in the environment. Sb(III) is prevalent in anoxic environments, whereas Sb(V) dominates under oxic conditions. The redox transformation of Sb generally involves microorganisms. Anaerobic microbiological Sb(V) respiration is a newly discovered process regulating the Sb redox transformation in soils. However, little is known about the role microbiological Sb(V) respiration plays in the fate of Sb in the subsurface, especially in the presence of sulfate and electron shuttles. Herein, we enriched a Sb(V) reducing microbiota (SbRM) from the subsurface near an active Sb mine. SbRM was dominated by genus Alkaliphilus (18-36%), Clostridiaceae (17-18%), Tissierella (24-27%), and Lysinibacillus (16-37%). The incubation results showed that SbRM reduced 88% of dissolved Sb(V) to Sb(III), but the total Sb mobility remained the same as in the abiotic control, indicating that SbRM alone did not increase the total Sb release, but regulated the Sb speciation in the subsurface. Micro X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) analysis suggested the association of Sb and Fe, and electron shuttles such as anthraquinone-2,6-disulphonic disodium salt (AQDS) markedly enhanced the Sb release due to its ability to facilitate Fe mineral dissolution. Sb L-edge and S K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) results demonstrated that indigenous SbRM immobilized Sb via Sb2S3 formation, especially in a sulfur-rich environment. Our study shows that Sb(V) respiring microbiota play an important role in Sb redox transformation in the subsurface. This conclusion provides a plausible explanation for the occurrence of high Sb(III) in paddy soils and subsurface groundwater. The new insights into Sb biotransformation warrant an extensive investigation of Sb(V) respiring reduction under different environmental conditions.

Mieke Verbeecka, J.P. Gustafssonb, C. Moensa and E. Smoldersa a Department of Earth and Environmental Science, KULeuven, Belgium b Department of Soil and Environment, SLU, Sweden mieke.verbeeck@kuleuven.be Due to potential hazardous effects, understanding the fate of antimony (Sb) in soils is essential. In soils, Sb(V) and Sb(III) are the main oxidation states. Both Sb(V) and Sb(III) can be strongly sorbed onto iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) hydroxides, by inner- or outer sphere surface complexation and this can be described by surface complexation modelling. It is hypothesized that Sb in soils originating from historical contamination may be less mobile than recently added Sb. The mechanism of this so-called ageing can be attributed to solid-state diffusion of Sb into the soil matrix or to incorporation into the Fe (hyd)roxide crystal lattice, both leading to Sb fixation. The aims of this study were (i) to relate time-dependent changes in the Sb mobility in soils to the Sb speciation and coordination environment in the solid phase by use of Sb K-edge XANES/EXAFS spectroscopy and (ii) to describe the solubility of Sb in soils by surface complexation modelling with the CD-MUSIC model for ferrihydrite. Nine soil samples with a range in soil organic carbon concentration, CaCO3 , pH and amorphous Fe and Al concentration were amended with 500 mg Sb(V) kg-1 via a stock solution of KSb(OH)6. This high concentration was needed to ensure good quality of the Sb K-edge EXAFS spectra and is a good proxy for Sb-contaminated soils. Model soil hydroxides (hydrous Fe and Al oxides) were prepared and spiked with Sb(V) at a Sb to Fe/Al ratio of 0.1. The samples were incubated at 20°C for 6 months at field-moist conditions. To evaluate changes in Sb sorption over time, freshly spiked samples were compared with the 6-month aged soil samples. The concentrations of Sb in the soil pore water decreased on average by a factor of three in the aged soils compared to Sb concentrations in the pore water of freshly contaminated soils. This resulted in increased solid:liquid distribution coefficients for both the spiked soils and the Sb(V) spiked Fe hydroxide samples (ferrihydrite), but not for the Al hydroxide. In the soils, the pH remained constant, however, in 2 soils, a pH drift towards lower pH was observed. The solid phase speciation analysis showed that over time and in all samples the redox speciation of the added Sb(V) did not change. No precipitation of ferric or calcium antimonates in the soil samples occurred. Preliminary results of the EXAFS modelling showed that the added Sb(V) is adsorbed to both Fe as Al hydroxides in the soil samples and that, with ageing, the Sb(V) coordination environment changes in the second shell. These changes were observed also for the Sb(V) spiked ferrihydrite, but not for the Al hydroxide, possibly indicating that Fe hydroxides are controlling Sb ageing in soils. At the conference, further EXAFS modelling of these results will be presented. Furthermore, the EXAFS data will be used to constrain a surface complexation model to describe Sb(V) solubility in soils.

According to µ-XRF mapping of the grain section, most of As were distributed and concentrated in the husk and bran part (mainly inorganic As) as well as in the embryo (As(III) and DMA). Sb distributed similarly to As in rice grain based on LA-ICP-MS. The results deepened our understanding about As and Sb pollution around Sb mining area.

Lia a Guangdong Institute of Eco-environmental Science & Technology, China b Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology, Rutgers University, United States wmsun@soil.gd.cn Biotransformation of antimony (Sb) is a newly discovered process regulating the Sb redox transformation in soils. Understanding such biogeochemical process may contribute to future bioremediation strategy to remove Sb from environments. In comparison to As, the relative of Sb belonging to the same group of periodic table, the biotransformation of Sb is much less studies. Our current understanding of the Sb-oxidizing and –reducing bacteria is entirely based on several pure isolates. In this study, we employed the stable isotope probing coupled with the metagenomic-binning to identify the microorganisms participating the Sb oxidation and reduction and reveal their potential mechanism to transform Sb. Sb-contaminated soils sampled from active Sb mining area were selected. Metagenomic analysis on this soil indicated that As-related genes (e.g., arsC and aioA) are correlated with Sb species, suggesting that microorganisms may use similar pathways to oxidize or reduce Sb as As. In order to verify this observation, DNA-SIP was performed to identify the potential Sb oxidizers and reducers in the microcosms inoculated from Sb-contaminated rice paddy soils and dry land soils. DNA-SIP indicated that Pseudomonas, Lysinibacillus, and Geobacter may be the potential Sb(V)-reducing bacteria. Further, metagenomic-binning was performed to reveal the physiological traits of the potential Sb(V)-reducing bacteria identified by DNA-SIP. Our data indicated that the Sb(V)-reducing bacteria may use the respiratory arsenate reductase (arrABD) to reduce Sb(V) to Sb(III). However, members of Lysinibacillus may use other mechanisms to transform Sb(V) instead of arrABD. Sb(III) oxidation also represents a very important geochemical process, which can reduce the toxicity of Sb. Therefore, experiments are currently on the way to identify the potential autotrophic Sb(III)-oxidizing bacteria in microcosms seeded from Sb-contaminated soils. Several novel Sb-metabolizing bacteria were identified in this study, indicating that DNA-SIP is a powerful tool to identify the Sb-metabolizing bacteria. The combination of DNA-SIP and metagenomic-binning suggested the effectiveness of these advance molecular techniques in unravelling the mystery of biotransformation of Sb. This work represents the first application of DNA-SIP and metagenomic-binning to identify Sb-metabolizing bacteria and their potential metabolic potentials and therefore provides a valuable set of data to definitively link identity with Sb cycling. The identification of novel putative Sb-metabolizing bacteria expands current knowledge regarding the Sb cycling.

Higher concentrations of Sb are usually resulted from anthropogenic activities, and particularly high Sb concentrations are found in the waters from mining areas and smelter sites. China is a country with the most abundant Sb resources with huge reservation and productivity on top of the world; Sb pollution has become one of the typical environmental issues in China. Due to the lack of corresponding management measures in early mining, however, a large number of mine wastes left over from history mining were discharged in disorder, some of which were dumped or piled directly in the streams of the mining area. Most of them were washed into the river bed by water flow and became one of the most important parts of sediments in the mining-impacted rivers. Usually, mine waste piles are exposed to the surface environment during the dry season, while they are submerged in rainy season. According to our study results, it is obviously that near-neutral circumstance combined with wet-dry cycle forms the favorable condition for the release of Sb from the mine wastes (sediments). Meanwhile, our study on the release and migration characteristics of Sb in the main stream of the river basin showed that the dissolved Sb contents flowing through the reservoir have increased in varying degrees. The reason is that the sediments at the bottom of the reservoir would release Sb into the waters under reducing conditions. So, contaminated stream sediments are the important sources of Sb in the river basins. In addition, research on the transportation and transformation of Sb in the mining-impacted fluvial system showed that a proportion of Sb were removed in the rivers due to adsorption onto particulate matter, whereas migration of Sb in the downstream of mine area was attributed to dispersion in dissolved forms. It was found that downstream sediments had elevated concentrations of mining-derived Sb, but there was a significant decrease in concentration of Sb in aqueous phase, suggesting that Sb behavior was conservative in the water-sediment systems under the oxic conditions prevailing in these waters. In a sense, Sb entering fluvial sediments through physical transport and natural sedimentation forms a sink of Sb in the river basin under oxidative environment. In view of the importance of sediments in mining-impacted fluvial system as the sources and sinks of Sb in the river basins, it can be seen that the Sb pollution on the river basins will be long-lasting. Therefore, we need to strengthen the risk assessment of Sb release from sediments in the river basins, and management strategies implemented.

In the environment it exists mainly in inorganic forms as antimonite [Sb(III)] and antimonate [Sb(V)] with little organic methylated species. Its distribution dramatic increases as a result of its rapid growth in industrial use. Selenium (Se) is considered beneficial at low dosage to plants as an antioxidant and it can inhibit the uptake of various heavy metals. The aim of this study is to investigate uptake, translocation, speciation of Sb in rice plants Se-biofortified or not, exposed to Sb(III) and Sb(V) at increased concentrations under hydroponic condition. At the same time, how Se influences/is influenced by the different Sb concentrations in the distribution of organic (SeCys2, SeMeSeCys and SeMet) and inorganic forms [Se(IV), Se(VI)] of selenium from roots to leaves, together Malondialdehyde (MDA) content as indicator of physiological status during plant growth. Oryza sativa L. grains were chosen for the hydroponic experiments. After Se-biofortification, at rice plants seedlings was added SbCl3 and other plants with SbCl5 at 5 different dosages (0, 1, 3, 9 and 27 mg L-1). Lyophilized and mineralized aboveground and the root samples were analysed by ICP-MS for total Se and Sb concentrations. Other macro elements (Ca, K, Na, Mg, Mn, Cr, Fe, Cu, As and Ni) were analysed by ICP-OES. Speciation of Sb and Se was performed by HPLC-ICP-MS on anion and cation exchange columns. MDA analysis on fresh materials confirm the role of antioxidant of Se at low dosage with low results in root and aboveground. The high-dose of Se used for biofortified roots and sprouts had significant biomass reductions even in the absence of Sb, while the low-dose ones showed not significantly different results from the control even in the presence of Sb. Sb, with or without the addition of Se, was accumulated more in the roots. Sb, present in aqueous solution such as Sb(III), was accumulated in the roots more than the Sb present in aqueous solution such as Sb(V). Se seemed to promote of Sb(III) store in the roots, Sb(V) showed a lower accumulation in the Se-enriched roots. In the leaves, the effect of Se as antagonist element of Sb was appreciable at intermediate concentrations of Sb (3 and 9 mg L-1). Sb(V) was the predominant specie in rice plants (79 to 93%). 9.3% of Sb(III) were found in roots and leaves when the amount of Sb increases in hydroponic solution. Chromatographic separation revealed the presence of unknown organic forms of both Sb and Se. Se underwent changes in the distribution of its chemical forms, especially organic, in the plant. Heterogeneity of the organic forms of Se in the roots, especially SeMeSeCys and Met, were in the plant roots at low Sb content. When the concentration of Sb increases, the organic forms of Se decreased in the roots and increase in the leaves, the percentages of SeMeSeCys and Met increase up to 20 and 30% of the sum of all Se species, respectively. Additional considerations may be included in the study, monitoring Sb speciation in the medium and in short-term experiments, for the instability of Sb(III) by isotopic dilution analysis.

The aim of this study was to examine and compare spatial and temporal uptake and biotransfer of the metalloids in foodwebs of the Bakers Creek - Macleay River catchment of northern NSW, which has been strongly affected by Sb and As contamination with over a century of gold (Au)-Sb mining and processing. Metalloid concentrations were measured in the water, sediment, and biota representing various trophic levels and diverse species assemblages (biofilms, algae, detritus, aquatic plants, macroinvertebrates, tadpoles, and fish) at fifteen morphologically and hydrologically different sites over four occasions in 2015. Data indicated that all stream components examined were variably enriched with both metalloids (e.g. 3.64 – 1187.82 µg L-1 Sb and 0.10 – 64.79 µg L-1 As in water; 58.69 -554.82 µg g-1 Sb and 4.85 – 30.16 µg g-1 As in detritus; 83.15 – 855.93 µg g-1 Sb and 70.08 – 222.27 µg g-1 As in sediment; 8.03 – 1203.35 µg g-1 Sb and 13.38 – 255.36 µg g-1 As in stream autotrophs; and 1.04 – 140.10 µg g-1 Sb and 0.56 – 404.92 µg g-1 As in heterotrophs) close to the source Bakers Creek (BC) site at all sampling occasions but this enrichment decreased substantially downstream from that site. The spatial distribution of Sb in water and sediment was strongly associated with distance from the mine, dissimilar to As, which was independent of distance. While bioaccumulation in the food webs existed and some of the greatest concentrations of Sb reported in biota were recorded, As showed greater uptake efficiency in foodweb biota. Temporal changes in metalloid sources (water, detritus, and sediment) to biota had little or no effect on Sb and As bioaccumulation in trophic groups, other than Sb in autotrophs collected from one site. Bioaccumulation of As in tissues of freshwater mussels, Corbicula sp., was greatest in body tissue, and As uptake was greater than Sb in all tissues. In contrast, the greatest Sb concentration in the mussels was found in the muscular foot tissue. Concentrations of Sb and As were elevated in plants, but sediment/soil to plant transfer was small, even though rhizosphere sediment/soil was elevated for both metalloids. Comparisons and mapping of metalloid transfer across feeding groups showed that neither trophic transference nor biomagnification of Sb or As through the food webs of the different sites occurred. Rather, there was a biodiminution of both metalloids with increasing trophic level. This is the first study with such a wide scope of sampling biota for both Sb and As and provides insight into metalloid ecosystem distribution and food web transfer. Ecotoxicological profiling of the measured concentrations on a range of aquatic organisms is the next practical step to better assess the risk associated with Sb and As co-occurence in aquatic environments.

China jaime.caplette@giub.unibe.ch Antimony (Sb) is a naturally occurring element, ranging from 0.3 – 8.4 mg kg-1 in soils. The US-EPA and EU consider Sb a priority pollutant of interest, potentially carcinogenic, and volatile stibines are known genotoxins. Sb contaminated sites, such as mining and smelting and shooting range sites are potential point sources of volatile Sb into the environment. Volatile Sb, stibine (SbH3), monomethylstibine (MMSb), dimethylstibine (DMSb), and trimethylstibine (TMSb), can be produced at ambient temperatures under aerobic and anaerobic conditions and represent an understudied portion of the biogeochemical cycle of Sb. Few studies have investigated volatile Sb production in natural media. The production and formation of volatile Sb in the soil environment is poorly understood due to the lack of an easy-to-use method for field and lab quantification. We validated a method for trapping hydrides of Sb (SbH3 and TMSb) using activated carbon sorbent material (ACSM). Volatile species of antimony were synthesized by hydride generation (HG) using standard solutions made from Sb(III) and trimethylantimony and trapped on ACSM. Our digestion method is validated for total Sb and recoveries of digested traps for HG of SbH3 were 89.58 ± 6.75 % (n = 3) and TMSb were 92.34 ± 3.94 % (n = 4). This method was used to capture total volatile Sb emanating from manure-amended (5%) flooded shooting range soils (Laupen, Switzerland) during an incubation period of 36 days. Our results show volatile Sb is produced from contaminated shooting range soils. We observed the in-situ production of volatile Sb from two rice paddy fields in the vicinity of the worlds largest Sb deposit (Xikuangshan mine, Lengshuijiang, China) using our newly validated trapping method for total volatile Sb. Our results show that volatile Sb is produced at low (-1 Sb) and high (-1 Sb) Sb contaminated sites in rice paddy fields. Up to 160 ng of Sb was trapped on the ACSM traps after t = 4 days at the high Sb site. These results equate up to 390.65 mg ha-1 y-1 of volatile Sb being produced from high Sb paddy fields. The relationship of Sb- volatilization with other parameters (Sb and multielement concentrations in porewaters and soils, DOC, anions (e.g., NO32-, NO2-, SO42-), pH and redox potential) will be discussed. We developed an easy and field-deployable method to capture volatile Sb produced from incubation and field experiments. Our results are the first to indicate volatile Sb is produced from flooded contaminated shooting range soils and paddy field sites. As these sites represent large point sources of Sb and have favorable conditions for bio- methylation and -volatilization processes, they could be large contributors of toxic stibines to the environment and influence the biogeochemical cycling of Sb.

The contaminated soils and sediments in Chenzhou, Hunan province in the South of China. Contamination of many different heavy metals is reported. Antimony (Sb) are present in various polluted sites. A better process description of the sorption processes of antimony in contaminated soils and sediments is needed. Therefore, an optimization of existing analysis techniques are recommended for the determination of the free antimony present in the samples. In this study, the ability to use the Donnan Membrane Technique for oxy-anions speciation was tested, more in particular for free antimony. The method was studied with artificial antimony solutions at different background concentrations, with different antimony species and with various antimony concentrations. It was concluded that high concentrations of antimony and background electrolyte concentrations tend to block the migration of antimony through the anion exchange membrane. Since the equilibria were not reached, the time needed for equilibrium was calculated using the obtained data and varied from 13 days to 126 days. The longest equilibrium times, e.g. 126 days, were attributed to the slow migration of the neutral species Sb(OH)3. Field DMT experiments for anions were performed in different rivers in Chenzhou, in Hunan Province. A high percentage of free antimony was present in the river systems and the attachment of Sb to dissolved organic carbon was suggested. The desorption behaviour was determined by batch sorption tests for the total amount of antimony and for the two species Sb(III) and Sb(V), using the HPLC-ICP-MS. The behaviour was tested under different pH values and varying CaCl2 concentrations. As a conclusion, high distribution constants Kdes seem to be attributed to the strong adsorption on the soils and irreversible sorption behaviour of Sb. A clear effect of iron oxides and the initial Sb concentration present in the soil is observed. A change in pH and desorption solution concentration (CaCl2) show a rather variable impact on the desorption behaviour. Often, it has been assumed that antimony (Sb) and arsenic (As) have the same behaviour in the environment.

The biogeochemical effects of microorganisms on redox potential and mobility of Sb were investigated in this research. A dissimilatory Sb(V)-reducing bacterium was isolated from stream sediment samples (Sb 3,069 mg/kg) taken in the vicinity of an Sb oxide-producing factory in Korea. This anaerobic rod-shaped bacterium reduced Sb(V) and grew through respiration using 5 mM Sb(V) and 10 mM acetate under pH 7.7 and 30 oC. A part of Sb(III) which was produced in anoxic minimal medium precipitated as a biomineral which was likely Sb(OH)3. Based on the phylogenetics of 16s rRNA gene sequence and DNA G+C content, the bacterium appears to be a novel strain of the Sinorhizobium genus. The results suggest that microorganisms may play a significant role in changing the redox state of Sb and thus geochemical fates of Sb in geological media. Twelve Sb-resistant bacteria were isolated from the same sediment samples, and eight of these strains were heterotrophic Sb(III)-oxidizing bacteria. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the Sb(III)-oxidizing bacteria fell within two subdivisions of Proteobacteria. Cupriavidus sp. NL4 and Comamonas sp. NL11 belong to the subdivision β-Proteobacteria. Acinetobacter sp. NL1, Acinetobacter sp. NL12, Pseudomonas sp. NL2, Pseudomonas sp. NL5, Pseudomonas sp. NL6, and Pseudomonas sp. NL10 are the members of the γ-subdivision of the Proteobacteria. Among them, Cupriavidus sp. NL4 completely oxidized 100 μmoles/L Sb(III) in 500 hours. The other strains could not oxidize all of the Sb(III) in the medium, even with longer incubation. The results imply that diverse bacterial lineages are able to detoxify sites polluted with Sb(III) by oxidizing it to Sb(V), and to contribute to antimony cycling in natural environments.

The mining industry is one of the most important sources of Sb, which could cause increasingly accumulation of that Sb and other toxic metals in supergene environment, such as soil and water. In the past 20 years, numerous studies focused on the environmental geochemistry of Sb and its environmental risk, but researches on the transportation and accumulation of Sb between sediments and aquatic plants are still rare. Interestingly, we have found that Typha latifolia Linn. can survive in a wetland seriously contaminated by discharges from a tailing pond of a large Sb smelting factory, southwest China. However, there is little information on why Typha latifolia Linn. can live in such wicked environment with high Sb concentrations, and whether it can uptake Sb or not. In order to investigate the distribution of Sb and As in the wetland, and ascertain the tolerance and/or accumulation of Sb by Typha latifolia Linn., eighteen sediments (including nine surface and nine rhizosphere sediments) and nine Typha latifolia Linn. samples were collected, and the concentrations of Sb and As in all samples were analysed by ICPMS. The results showed that the concentrations of Sb and As in sediments were 743.7 ± 327.0 mg/kg and 24.4 ± 11.6 mg/kg, respectively, suggesting that the sediments in the wetland were seriously polluted by wastewater discharged from the tailing pond of the large Sb smelting factory. Compared to surface sediments (669.6 ± 228.8mg/kg Sb and 21.3 ± 4.70 mg/kg As), the rhizosphere sediments were much more enriched in Sb (817.9 ± 403.1mg/kg) and As (27.5 ± 15.6 mg/kg ), which may infer that the root exudates of Typha latifolia Linn. could be helpful for bounding Sb and As around its rhizosphere. Typha latifolia Linn. can uptake large amounts of Sb and As, although our previous research had documented that the bioavailabilities of Sb and As in tailings were quite low.

It is a common contaminant of coal and oil. Although it is considered as geochemical non-mobile element, it enters the environments from natural as well as anthropogenic sources, e.g. industry, agriculture, traffic and burning of fossil fuels. It is present in relatively low concentrations in lakes, rivers and drinking water. Antimony is dangerous metalloid with potential carcinogenic effect on living organisms. Plants take up Sb from soil solution by roots and it can substitute other essential elements, like phosphorus, and therefore it might be phytotoxic. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the phytotoxic effect of antimony on growth and performance of Arundo donax, a fast growing grass suitable for phytoremediation of contaminated sites. The rooted cuttings were grown in perlite regularly watered with nutrient solution (control) and with the same nutrient solution containing 10 mg kg-1 Sb (Sb treatment) for 5 month in controlled environmental conditions. At the end of the experiment the growth of roots and shoots was compared. The uptake of Sb and selected other elements in roots and shoots, content of photosynthetic pigments in leaves and leaf photosynthetic performance, as well as anatomy of plant tissues was investigated. We found that antimony reduced the growth of plants and was accumulated mostly in root tissues. Antimony significantly reduced photosynthetic pigments, although the analysis of chlorophyll fluorescence revealed that the photosynthesis was only partially affected by presence of this element.

As a metalloid element with potential toxicity and carcinogenicity, Sb pollution in soil and groundwater has seriously threatened to the human environment for the combustion of fossil fuel and waste containing Sb and a series of mining activities. Recent years, Sb isotope technology is used as a new perspective to identify pollution source and reveal its migration and transformation. In this study, Sb isotopic composition of river water and groundwater collected in mining area was determined by MC-ICP-MS (Multi-Collector Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometer). A method of preconcentration and purification was developed and optimized based on the use of a silica-based thiol resin column, which achieves a quantitative recovery of Sb (at least 95%). When SPEX (dissolution of Sb ore) and GSB were used for in-house standard materials of Sb isotope measurement, it was demonstrated that there was little Sb isotope fractionation in the proposed method, which the ε123Sb falls in the -0.1 to -0.4 level. Therefore, the method for the preconcentration and purification of Sb is effective for isotope analysis. Indium (In) was used as an internal standard for correction of the instrumental mass discrimination occurring in the MC-ICP-MS instrument. Under the conditions of Apex injection, the ε^123^Sb value for in-house standard solution and water samples could be determined with a reproducibility (or external precision) of 0.04‰. The isotopic composition of the selected water samples shows a variation of 2 to 3ε units. One groundwater sample showing light isotope enrichment contrasted Sb isotopic signature of others samples containing river water and groundwater, which could be related to various biogeochemical processes when Sb transfers from rocks, mine wastes and sediments to the water compartment. This result shows that Sb isotope technology may be useful in tracking pollution sources and biogeochemical processes in hydrologic systems. Due to the limited water samples and the absence of leachate from tailings pond and waste heap, a small isotopic variation of samples was observed. Now the digestion procedure for ore samples especially for stibnite and slags is developing and optimizing, so the relationship between potential source of Sb and water environment can be established in the near future. Assuredly the processes (dissolution, oxidation, precipitation and adsorption) may generate fractionation during Sb transports from ore material into the water environment, and these part of the related experiments will continue to be carried out as soon as possible.

Soils were treated with green waste compost and deferrisation sludge prior to incubation. Additionally, the effects of treatment with acid and lime were examined. Pore water was collected 5 times with MacroRhizon suction samplers, and Sb concentrations in water were measured. Sb speciation in pore water, that involved Sb III and Sb V, was determined by ICP MS-HPLC. Additionally, five operationally defined fractions of Sb in soil solid phase were determined by sequential extraction before and after incubation. The study confirmed a relatively high concentrations of Sb in pore water of shooting range soils, that in all cases exceeded 10 μg∙L-1 set as a threshold for satisfying quality underground water. The waterlogging considerably reduced final Sb concentrations in pore water, irrespectively of the kind of pretreatment, except for a temporal increase in Sb solubility in two soils. Suchresults illustrate ambiguity of Sb behaviour in soils. Therefore, applicability of any treatments designed for remediation of shooting range soils should be thoroughly examined in relation to the properties of those particular soils. Sb III was negligible in pore water of oxidized soils, while its share in pore water of waterlogged soils was considerable and tended to increase with prolonged incubation. The highest concentrations of Sb III in pore water were found in waterlogged acid-treated soils, and also in limed soils. Finally, this research allowed us to conclude that sequential extraction did not prove to be a suitable tool for examining the changes in Sb and As binding in sandy shooting range soils, mainly because of large heterogeneity of soils and amendments.

As the ninth-most mined metal worldwide, a large quantity of Sb and Sb-contained compounds have been released into the environment. Sources of Sb release include abrasion from brake linings, use as flame retardants, plastic production, mining, refining and shooting activities. Though the ecotoxicity of Sb is not well known, Sb(III) compounds are generally considered to be more toxic and mobile than Sb(V), similar to that of As. Therefore, distribution, speciation, toxicity and bioavailability of Sb in various environmental compartments are considered to be primary controlling factors for human and ecosystem health. To investigate Sb distribution and biogeochemical characteristics in contaminated soils, we collected three different types of Sb-contaminated soil samples in South Korea: 1) Sb refining factory, 2) Sb waste landfill site, and 3) military shooting range. Mineralogy and speciation of Sb were investigated using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and x-ray absorption fine-structure (XAFS) analysis. Metagenomic analysis was used to characterize the microbial community compositions. Citric acid extraction and sequential extraction were also used for Sb fraction analysis. Soil samples adjacent to Sb refining factory and antimony waste landfill site generally represented higher Sb concentration than the shooting rage and showed significant change of Sb concentration with depth. We will discuss Sb speciation in these different types of contaminated soils. These results will be correlated to microbial community dynamics analyses.

The mechanism of the interactions between NOM and antimony (Sb) was previously unraveled under sunlight, while remained poorly understood in the absence of light. In our study, the combination of wet chemistry, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) based calculations were applied to explore the mechanism of Sb(III) oxidation induced by various LMWPAs and their effect on Sb(III) adsorption on goethite in the dark. The results indicated that Sb(III) was rapidly oxidized to Sb(V) in the presence of LMWPAs in neutral and alkaline conditions. The reactive oxygen species (hydrogen peroxide) and quinone species (the semiquinone radical and oxidized forms of LMWPAs) were the main contributors to the oxidation. According to DFT based calculations, the bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of the phenolic hydroxyl groups is well correlated with the Sb(III) oxidation rate constant, which is in line with its pro-oxidant property towards Sb(III) through the production of semiquinone radical. The significant inhibition of Sb adsorption on goethite as the pH increased was observed. Except for the competitive adsorption by LMWPAs, the inhibition also resulted from the extensive Sb(III) oxidation in the suspension and the lower Sb(V) sorption capacity of goethite at higher pH. Besides, the edge-sharing inner-sphere complexes were formed between Sb and goethite regardless of the presence of LMWPAs. The findings of this study provided new insights into the role of LMWPAs in Sb(III) oxidation and their profound effect on Sb immobilization by iron minerals.

Suna, L. Zhaoa and H. Houa,b a State Key Laboratory of Environmental Criteria and Risk Assessment, Chinese Research Academy of Environmental Sciences, China b College of Water Sciences, Beijing Normal University, China 15110038821@163.com Introduction: Antimony (Sb) is a naturally occurring metalloid. Anthropogenic activities have caused elevated levels of Sb in soil. Sb is a toxic element and Sb(III) is much more toxic than Sb(V). However, Sb(V) is the dominant speciation in field soil. Thus using Sb(III) to study Sb toxicity will greatly overrate its toxicity and has a little ecological relevance for assessing hazard posed by Sb in real life scenarios. The springtail Folsomia candida has been extensively used as an ecologically relevant model organism because its high sensitivity. The interest on toxicity of Sb has increased in recent decades, however, data on toxicity of Sb to springtails are fairly limited and existing studies did not consider effects of various soil properties and long aging time. As all know, these two factors could significantly influence metal toxicity and should be considered for the purpose of toxicity assessment. To address this, the chronic toxicity of Sb(V) to Folsomia candida were evaluated following ISO guideline in the laboratory studies. Materials and methods: Ten types of soil, representing typical agricultural soils in China, were used as test soils. The Sb(V) were artificially added into soils and nominal concentrations were set up as 400–12800 mg/kg. After aging Sb-treated soils for 150 d, the total Sb and water soluble Sb concentrations were measured, and springtails were exposed to soils for 28 d. At the end of test, the number of reproduction were counted. The EC50 (concentrations causing 50% inhibition) values are calculated using Logistic curve. Results: The toxicity of Sb significantly differed between ten soils, closely relating to distinct variations in water soluble Sb. The EC50 values based measured total Sb ranged from 1735 mg/kg to 13680 mg/kg, which corresponded to a 8-fold variation among ten soils. Correlation analysis showed that EC50 values correlated significantly and positively with clay, organic matter, free Fe and Al oxides, amorphous Fe oxides, indicating decreased toxicity with increasing contents of these soil constituents. The EC50 values significantly and negatively correlated with pH and CaCO3. The prediction models were further developed using regression analysis. The results indicated that free Fe oxides was the most important single factor in predicting Sb toxicity, explaining 89.3% of toxicity variance, and the inclusion of clay in this model could best explain the toxicity variance (95.9%). Soil pH and organic matter could also well explain the toxicity variance. Conclusions: This study not only demonstrated the significant toxicity differences of Sb to springtails among soils, but also developed quantitative relationships using key soil properties. It should be noted that the prediction models was based on soils aged for 150 d which made Sb equilibrate sufficiently in soil, which allow prediction of Sb toxicity in a wide range of soils and are helpful to establish soil-specific quality criteria.

In the current study, four soils with variable TOC contents were sampled from two industrial sites, representing the high dose perfluorinated compounds (PFCs) and heavy metals (antimony, Sb and lead, Pb) contaminated soils. Two Fe rich waste materials (slag and Fe charcoal) produced during the melting process of iron and titanium ore were tested as remediation agents, with the target of immobilizing pollutants in the soil systems, preventing them from contaminating the environment. Both materials were tested for their remediation efficacy of heavy metals (Pb and Sb) and PFCs contaminated soils. The slag and Fe-charcoal are rich in Fe and calcium (Ca), the abundant Fe oxyhydroxides endows both sorbents high affinity for metals. Together with the formation of Ca‒Pb/Sb‒Fe precipitates, Sb adsorption to slag and Fe-charcoal ranged from 8.2 ‒ 30.7 μg g-1 and 4.7 ‒ 26.3 μg g-1 respectively. For Pb, slag showed an adsorption of 3.0 ‒8.2 μg g-1, and this value of Fe-charcoal was 8.8 ‒ 13.7 μg g-1. Generally, organic matter in the soil system hindered the adsorption of both Sb and Pb by slag, most likely due to competition for the active sites on the sorbent. However, Fe-charcoal showed better performance with high TOC soils, which can be attributed to the formation of organo-metal complexes that helped the sequestration of Sb and Pb. Fe-charcoal showed promising performances in the immobilization of PFCs in mineral soil with low TOC content, the Freundlich constant (KF) ranged between 5.1 ‒6.5 (μg kg-1) (μg L-1)-n, with the nF values of 0.33 ‒ 0.44. However, the high organic content of the high TOC-soils drastically hindered the adsorption of PFCs by Fe-charcoal. In general, both slag and Fe-charcoal can be used as reliable remediation agents for Pb and Sb contaminated soils, while the utilization of Fe-charcoal requires moderate to low content of organic carbon in the bulk soil for PFCs immobilization. The result of this study gives the option of reusing these Fe rich wasted materials as promising sorbents for both heavy metals and organic pollutants. Possible uses of these sorbents can be as soil amendments related to the heavily polluted industrial sites remediation or used as barriers in landfills for sorption of leachate contaminants.

China bDepartment of Environmental Science, University of Liverpool, UK Zhaofeng.Yuan@ac.uk Antimony (Sb) is a priority pollutant in the environment, but much less attention has been paid for migrating Sb risk than its sister element arsenic (As). Contaminations of Sb and As are always co-occurring as a result of mining activities. Interestingly, the behaviours of Sb and As are quite different under changing redox conditions. Arsenic tends to be mobilized under reducing conditions as a result of arsenate desorption from iron oxides reduction as well as its subsequent reduction to arsenite, while the inverse was observed for Sb. Paddy soils are the largest artificial wetlands in the world, and supporting the growth of rice. In order to maintain a high yield, NO3-1 fertilizer is usually applied. It is well recognized NO3-1 is the strongest oxidizer in saturated soils after O2 is depleted. However, the influence of NO3-1 application on Sb mobility remains largely unsolved, but the relative research would be crucial for mitigating Sb risk in rice production. We hypothesized the release of Sb in soil water interface could be triggered by applying NO3-1 fertilizer in flooded paddy soils. A novel technology, entitled Integrated Porewater Injection (IPI) profiler, was used to explore the high-resolution (mm level) Sb profile (10 mm in overlying water and 50 mm in soils) repeatedly in Shaoguan (SG) paddy soils with or without NO3-1 addition (500 μM NO3-1·L-1 in overlying water). Before applying NO3-1, overlapping profiles were observed for the NO3-1 treatments and control soils. The Sb profile in the SG paddy soils can be divided into three stages: 1) high Sb (~3 μg·L-1) was observed in oxic condition (overlying water and the top 3 mm soil); 2) Sb decreased dramatically to low concentration (~1 μg·L-1) in reducing soils near soil water interface; 3) Sb incraesed slowly to high concentration (~3 μg·L-1) in deep soils. Nitrate addition significantly increased Sb concentration in top soils (2-13 mm). The fast tranformation of NO3-1 in the top reducing soils may explain why the influence of NO3-1 on Sb release is restricted in top soils. Eight days after the NO3-1 addition, the extra release of Sb in top soils disappears. These results indicate NO3-1 application in paddy soils would lead to a temporary antimony release in soil water interface. Therefore, great care should be taken to apply NO3-1 in Sb polluted paddy soils. Furthermore, more studies are required to elucidate the correlation between Sb behaviours and N cycling in aquatic ecosystems.

Tighea, L. Milana and S.C. Wilsona a School of Environmental and Rural Science, University of New England, Australia sdohert5@myune.edu.au Antimony (Sb) derived from historic mining waste from the Hillgrove gold/Sb mine has dispersed over 300km through the Macleay River Catchment of south-east Australia. Stibnite and Sb-rich ore form the bulk of the dispersed material, with minor arsenopyrite. The resulting co-contamination of the Macleay River has been well-characterised, but the processes underlying the sequestration of As and Sb in the catchment are unknown. This study aimed to characterise metalloid mobilisation and sequestration processes whilst also identifying diferences in the geochemisty of the two elements in this system. Sediments were collected from 13 sites spanning the length of the waste dispersal pathway in the river system. Sediment elemental content was determined with aqua regia digestion and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES). Elemental composition of individual grains from high concentration sites was undertaken using electron microprobe. Extracts targeting the water soluble (H2O), easily exchangeable (0.5M NaHCO3), and amorphous-associated (0.5M acid ammonium oxalate) metalloid content of sediments were analysed using ICP-mass spectrometry and atomic fluorescence spectrometry (AFS). Iron (Fe) was significantly positively correlated with total As and Sb in the lower Macleay River, while in the more heavily contaminated upper reaches only As was correlated with Fe. Electron microprobe analysis of highly contaminated sediments identified grains of high purity Sb2O3. Arsenic was identified at concentrations up to 2.5 % of total grain weight, but only in association with Fe oxide grains. The three-step extraction showed that a similar proportion of total Sb (59 – 88 %) and As (59 – 82 %) remained in the residual fraction of the upper catchment sediment, whilst in the sediments of the lower river residual As (51 – 71 %) was significantly greater than Sb (27 – 53 %). Antimony in sediment was more water soluble than As throughout the catchment (0.6 – 2.2 % total Sb compared with 0.4 – 1.4 % of total As), but 0.5M NaHCO3 extractable As was greater than Sb (by 1.9 – 5.3 times). Metalloid association with amorphous phases was significant and positively correlated with distance from the upper catchment source, being up to 29 – 49 % of total As and 22 – 64 % of Sb in lower catchment sediments. Antimony associated with amorphous phases was significantly lower at two sites often subject to anoxic conditions (22 – 28 % of total Sb) compared with nearby aerated sediments (47 – 63 %). This variability was not observed for As. The results suggest that As has been more completely dissolved from its mineral sources than Sb, and been significantly incorporated into Fe hydroxyoxides throughout the dispersal pathway. In contrast Sb remains in high purity forms in the upper Macleay River, and becomes increasingly associated with amorphous phases in the lower reaches. The sediment associations of Sb were more variable than those of As when comparing sites with different redox conditions. This study provides critical insights into metalloid sequestration processes under a range of environmental conditions which is vital to fully quantify the risks posed by As and Sb in contaminated river catchments.

Lu Yua, Jianwei Zhou a, Jing Liub and Xiaocen Jia a a School of Environmental Studies, China University of Geosciences, China b College of Resources and Environment, Southwest University, China mei836@126.com With the rapid development and application of biochemical technology, the biogeochemical behaviour interaction between microbial and metal elements has become a research hotspot, especially the research about relationship between microbial and toxic metal elements. Shewanella is a facultative anaerobic iron-reducing bacterium. Studies have been conducted to investigate the reaction of Shewanella sp. with various heavy metals, including iron, arsenic, uranium, etc. Shewanella sp. can reduce, precipitate and even remove heavy metals, so it is widely used in sewage treatment. Yet, there are few articles discussing the interaction between Shewanella sp. and antimony currently, especially about antimonial smelting slag. In this research, the antimonial smelting slag is reacted with Shewanella sp. over 10 days at circumneutral pH conditions. The changes in Eh, pH, dynamics and speciation of Sb and Fe are investigated at room temperature. The results are as follows: (1) A large amount of Fe3+ released from smelting slag is preferentially reduced to Fe2+ by Shewanella sp., and then precipitated as nano-Fe sulphides (e.g. FeS, FeS2), the Fe2+ concentration first rose to the highest peak and then decreased to a constant after seven days; (2) The dissolved Fe3+ and Sb3+ are subjected to the redox reaction, and the Sb3+ is oxidized to the Sb5+. This process is only needed less than 24h. The presence of cerium oxide in a sterile control test indicates the presence of a redox reaction during the reaction, and (3) the total Sb concentration is reduced by the adsorption of iron or manganese (hydr)oxide dissolved in the solution from the smelting slag. A supplementary experiment is done to further explore the relationship between Sb and Fe under the action of Shewanella sp.. The chemical reagents (K(SbO)C4H4O6•1/2H2O and KSb(OH)6) were used to simulate slag and reacted with Shewanella sp., and Fe3+ was used as a control. When there was no iron element, the Sb was reduced, it was oxidized. This further illustrates that, although Shewanella sp. has a reducing ability for Sb and has great application prospects, when coexisting with iron, there are sequential reaction sequences and other complex reactions. This study provides a theoretical basis for the treatment of heavy metal pollution in the mine by Shewanella sp..

Huanga, T. Konga, F. Hana, W. Taoa and W. Suna a Guangdong Institute of Eco-Environmental Science & Technology, China sxx860613@foxmail.com Mine tailings are usually fine particles that discarded as wastes during mining processes. Although these materials are considered low quality for extractions, they contain a considerable amount of metal(loid)s. It has been reported that there are more than 8 billion tons of tailings in U.S., 4 billion tons in former Soviet Union, and more than 6 billion in China. Thus, the storage of these hazardous wastes is a serious environmental concern and received extensive attentions globally. To reduces its risk, bioremediation was emerged as a promising method for re-extraction or stabilization of the metals. One of the obstacles, however, is that tailings are usually characterized as low organic content, low nutrient, and high metal concentrations. Indigenous microbial community, however, was adapted to the extreme environmental condition by adopting survival strategies, such as nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation, which converts nitrogen gas to ammonium, is a essential natural process that provide nitrogen source to the ecosystems. As an marconutrient for all life forms, the bio-available nitrogen content limits the tailing restoration and reclamation. Thus, understanding the nitrogen fixation potential is necessary for bioremediation process. Our knowledge regarding how does the heavy metal(loid)s impact the nitrogen fixation process in tailings is still sparse. In the current study, tailing and soil samples from five representative mining areas across the southern China were collected and analyzed. The geochemical analysis revealed significantly elevated metal concentrations, along with reduced organic carbon and nitrogen contents in tailings. Multivariate analysis suggested that both As and Sb contents were the key factors in shaping both total and nitrogen fixing microbial community compositions, and thus the community structure were distinct between tailings and soils. Cluster I nitrogen fixers, including members of Burkholderiales, Rhizobiales, and Xanothomonadales, were enriched and identified as the core microbiome in tailings. Despite the higher relative nitrogenase gene (nifH) abundance, nitrogen fixation potential in tailings were significantly lower than that in soils. The result of the current study suggested that metal(loid)s contamination, along with the oligotrophic conditions, posit strong suppression on microbial activity and impairs key environmental processes, such as nitrogen fixation.

This study investigated the oxidation and sequestration of Sb(III) from solution onto newly formed biogenic Mn oxides (BMO), using batch experiments and spectroscopic analyses. Kinetic experiments indicated that Sb(III) was quickly oxidized and sequestrated after 10 min by BMO at a pH of 7.0. Bacterial activity in BMO did not significantly affect Sb(III) sequestration. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer (XPS) analysis indicated that Sb(V) was the only species remaining in the solid phase after the reaction of Sb(III) with BMO. Chemical extraction experiments with the (NH4)2HPO4 and NH2OH·HCl showed that the dominant fractions of Sb(III) after the reaction included a Mn oxides bound fraction and residual fraction. XRD results further indicated that the rapid oxidation of Sb(III) by BMO contributed to the production of Mn(II) antimonate precipitates. The formation of less reactive Mn(III) blocked Sb(V) adsorption on the BMO surface. These results provide important experimental evidence related to the effect of BMO on the environmental behavior of Sb(III).

Sb(III) mobility in natural aquatic environments is generally enhanced by dissolved organic matter. Competition between such low molecular organic acid complexation and adsorption of Sb(III) has received little attention, which prompted us to measure Sb(III) adsorption by iron oxyhydroxide adsorbents commonly used in water treatment plants. Sb K-edge X-ray absorption fine structure spectra gave Sb–O and Sb–Fe distances and coordinations compatible with a bidentate binuclear inner-sphere complex with trigonal Sb(O,OH)3 polyhedra sharing corners with Fe(O,OH)6 octahedra and a bidentate mononuclear inner-sphere complex with Sb(O,OH)4 tetrahedra at alkaline pH. Experimental batch titration data were fitted using the charge-distribution multi-site surface complexation (CD-MUSIC) model, taking competitive effects for the organic ligand into consideration. The adsorption efficiency at acid–neutral pH decreased as the Sb(III) concentration increased. The CD-MUSIC adsorption model indicates that this was solely caused by strong competition from tartrate complexation with adsorption constants up to three orders of magnitude (logK units) higher than the iron oxyhydroxide adsorption constants without taking this competition into account. The study provides consistent CD-MUSIC surface complexation stability constants, allowing the new database to be used to model reliably adsorption of toxic oxyanions in anoxic aqueous environments, in particular also to model yet difficult to understand competition between Sb(III) and As(III).

Furthermore, there is a problem regarding the stability of inorganic trivalent Sb (iSb(III)) during sample treatment. The main aim of this work was to develop an analytical methodology for the separation of Sb species of NMG-Sb(V), iSb(V), and iSb(III) in Glucantime®. To achieve this, a methodology was developed based on anion exchange High Performance Liquid Chromatography Hydride Generation Atomic Fluorescence (HPLC-HG-AFS) using gradient elution mode with different concentrations of Na2H2EDTA as the mobile phase. The results show that 0.473 mM Na2H2EDTA should be used for 1.20 min as the first mobile phase for the separation of NMG-Sb(V), which should then be changed to 20 mM for the elution of the inorganic species. The results also reveal that iSb(III) content may be underestimated when sample filtration is used as the previous separation step. Instead of filtration, this study demonstrates that adjustment to pH 9 and dilution in deionized water are a better strategy to determine the iSb(III) content.

Manganese oxides in soils, sediments and water systems can bind strongly with bacterial biomass through physical-chemical processes to form bacteria-mineral composites, which may play a significant role in determining the sequestration of antimony at solid interfaces. In the study, we synthesis mineral-bacteria composite using birnessite and Sb-tolerant Bacillus cereus that isolated from Sb-contaminated soils in Lengshuijiang City, China; we investigate the binding of Sb(V) on cell-birnessite composite using batch adsorption coupled with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). From the Scanning electron microscope, we can see that the flaky birnessite is tightly bound to the surfaces of bacterial cells. Adsorption of Sb(V) conforms to the Langmuir isotherm model, wih maximum adsorption of Sb(V) of ~59.2 mg g–1 on birnessite, compared to that of 14.3 mg g–1 on isolated bacteria. The adsorption of Sb(V) decreases with pH increasing from 3 to 10. The adsorption of Sb(V) on the B. cereus-birnessite composite is intermediate between those on the end-members. Morevoer, Sb(V) adsorption conforms to a non-additive rule, i.e., Sb removal by cell-birnessite composites is ~16-50% larger than that predicted based on the end-member adsorptivities. XPS results confirm that Sb binds to the MnOH groups of birnessite, and the carboxyl and amino groups of bacteria in the cell-birnessite composite. In these cases, our results indicate that it wil be important to consider the fate and mobility of antimony with respect to manganese oxides-organo composites, in addition to pure mineral phases.

Moreover, thermodynamically based surface complexation models (SCMs) describing Sb(V) sorption on LDHs have not yet been examined and the number of other studies dealing with the SCMs investigating Sb(V) sorption on different solid materials is also limited. Therefore, we propose coupling SCMs with various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques to investigate the Sb(V) binding arrangements on the Mg-Fe LDH surface. The Sb(V) sorption on Mg-Fe LDHs was performed at different initial Sb(V) concentrations, ionic strengths and pH values. The removal rate (described by pseudo-first order kinetics) and the maximal (ad)sorbed amount (described by Langmuir model) increased with decreasing pH values. The pH-dependent sorption data at different ionic strengths and Sb(V) concentrations were further modeled by the diffuse layer model (DLM) which predicted preferable formation of monodentate mononuclear complexes on the Mg-Fe LDH surface. Spectroscopic (XRD, FTIR-ATR, XPS) and microscopic (SEM/EDX with elemental mapping) techniques were used to further specify the sorption mechanisms. The influence of chemical adsorption, surface-induced precipitation of brandholzite, formation of brandholzite-like phases and/or anion exchange was observed depending on the Sb(V) concentrations and pH values. At lower pH values, the negatively charged Sb(V) surface complexes adsorbed on the Mg-Fe LDH surface provided binding sites for Mg(II) that is commonly leached from Mg-Fe LDHs. This process resulted in the formation of individual layers corresponding to the brandholzite-like phases. Nevertheless, the surface-induced precipitation of crystalline brandholzite occurred only at higher pH values. The binding of Sb(V) to both Fe(III) and Mg(II) in the Mg-Fe LDH structure was confirmed by spectroscopic techniques suggesting the proposed sorption mechanisms. At all pH values, Sb(V) was nonhomogeneously distributed on the Mg-Fe LDH surface (especially on smaller particles) showing the presence of different (ad)sorption sites, i.e., monolayer/multilayer adsorption as well as surface-induced precipitation. The surface complexation modeling supported by solid-state analyses provided a strong tool to investigate the binding arrangements of Sb(V) on the Mg-Fe LDH surface. Such a comprehensive mechanistic/modeling approach has not previously been presented and predicted the Sb(V) sorption behavior on Mg-Fe LDHs under different conditions. Moreover, the presented mechanistic/modeling approach can be useful for newly synthesized materials to evaluate their Sb(V) sorption properties.

Deng, Y.Qiu, Z. Su and T. Xiao* Key Laboratory for Water Quality and Conservation of the Pearl River Delta, Ministry of Education, School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Guangzhou University, China nnwang@gzhu.edu.cn Antimony (Sb) is classified as one of the 13 priority pollutant metals and is increasingly detected in the environment mainly due to various mining activities and industrial applications. Sb is a non-essential trace metal in human body and similar to arsenic (As) in chemical properties and toxicity, however, little was known about environmental behaviors of Sb and associated pollution cleanup. Owing to the unique chemical properties of iron, many researches reported on the Sb removal by chemosynthesized iron oxyhydroxides or Fe/Mn bimetal oxides, but few was about natural particles. Secondary iron minerals (SIMs), such as schwertmannite, jarosite and goethite, commonly occur in acid mine drainage environments and are considered an important sink for toxic metals. In this study, two natural sediments from the acid coal drainage, including the newborn secondary iron mineral (n-SIM) and mature one (m-SIM), were used to remove Sb(III/V), and the adsorption behaviors and surface structures of Sb(III/V) on secondary iron minerals were comprehensively investigated. The natural sediments m-SIM and n-SIM were mainly composed of Fe, O and S, and their EDS-mapping analyses indicated that the morphologies of m-SIM and n-SIM were dependent on the distribution of O. The results of XRD analyses implied that both similar crystalline and amorphous iron oxide minerals coexisted in these natural sediments. However, m-SIM and n-SIM had different microstructures. The particle size of m-SIM was larger than that of n-SIM, and m-SIM was spheroids with a close-packed arrangement and regular sharp, while n-SIM had two morphologies: sea urchin-like and pompon-like with a random loose arrangement and non-uniform sizes. Batch experimental results showed that the effect of solution pH on Sb(III) adsorption was more remarkable than that of Sb(V) and the optimal pH was 7 and 3, respectively. The adsorption behavior of Sb(III/V) on n-SIM and m-SIM were spontaneous, endothermic, controlled by chemical adsorption and followed the monolayer Langmiur isotherm model. m-SIM had a larger adsorption capacity to Sb(III) than Sb(V), while n-SIM had a reverse trend but its maximum adsorption capacities of Sb(III) (219 mg/g) and Sb(V) (366 mg/g) were higher than those of m-SIM. The presence of Na+ promoted the Sb(III/V) adsorption while Ca2+ suppressed Sb(V) adsorption on SIMs. Characterization techniques of FTIR, Raman and XPS indicated the changes of functional groups, elemental compositions and binding energy regions after the adsorption of Sb(III/V) on SIMs, and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analyses showed that Sb(V) was the dominant species adsorbed on SIMs. These results revealed that the adsorption mechanism of Sb(III/V) on SIMs involved in the electrostatic force, coordinated action, oxidation and ion exchange reaction. This study contributes to better understanding for Sb adsorption mechanism on natural secondary iron minerals, and also provides potential materials for environmental remediation.

At the moment, the technologies to reduce antimony (Sb) uptake in crops are also scarce. This study attempted to use exogenous iron and water management to synchronously reduce the uptake of Sb, arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) by rice plants. A pot experiment was set up using a Sb and Cd co-contaminated soil which was treated with 5 mg kg-1, 10 mg kg-1 and 20 mg kg-1 FeCl3 (Experiment I), and treated with flooding, intermittent irrigation and dry farming (Experiment II). Since unsuitable water management will result in As accumulation in crops even when As concentrations in soil are not high, we also monitored the As concentration in the soil, soil solution and in different plant tissues. Our results showed that long-term irrigation resulted in an increase in Sb and As concentrations in the soil solution at the early stage of plant growth. In general, the addition of Fe had a negative effect on the Sb and As concentrations in the soil solution and grains, but did not have a negative effect on their available concentrations in soil and the concentrations in the shoots and husks. 20 mg kg-1 FeCl3 promoted rice fresh biomass but did not affect the yield and essential element concentrations in the grains of this rice plant. Lower soil moisture also decreased the Sb and As concentrations but increased Cd concentration in the soil solution and grains (including their available concentrations in the soil). Lower soil moisture also decreased fresh biomass and most essential nutrient elements in the grains. The addition of FeCl3 facilitated the formation of Fe/Mn plaques, but lower soil moisture only facilitated the manganese plaque formation. Iron plaque formation under FeCl3 treatments could constrain As but showed little effects on the immobilization of Cd and Sb. In contrast, lower soil moisture facilitated the concentration of Cd on the Mn plaque. In conclusions, although FeCl3 in most cases could reduce the As and Sb concentrations in the grains, it also resulted in the accumulation of grain Cd under the 10 mg kg-1 FeCl3 treatment. Soil moisture is a vital factor to control the uptake of As, Cd and Sb in rice plants and unsuitable water management practices could lead to the As accumulation even at very lower As concentration in soil.

Besides the widespread stibnite (Sb2S3) mineral, aqueous Sb-S complexes, so-called thioantimony, have been measured or modeled in several previous studies. However, because the instability and detecting difficulty of thioantimony, the role of thioantimony in Sb biotransformation process remains unknown. Thioantimony are formed during the reaction between sulfide and antimony. Sulfide in natural water is mainly generated by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), and SRB have simply been believed to inhibit Sb mobilization via Sb2S3 formation. However, our study found that Sb release was greatly enhanced by SRB because of the formation of dissolved thioantimonate. pe-pH diagrams suggested that in most neutral Sb contaminated water (Sb concentration at μg/L level), it is thioantimonate formed rather than Sb2S3 in the presence of biogenic sulfide. The formation of thioantimony promoted the transformation from goethite to ferrihydrite. Even with higher surface reactivity than goethite, the newly formed ferrihydrite failed to reuptake thioantimonate, which finally causing Sb mobility. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometric (FT-ICR MS) and the density functional theory (DFT) calculation were conducted to explore the thioantimonate formation mechanism. A new pathway was proposed based on the direct reaction between antimonate and sulfide without redox transformation. Multiple intermediates with six/five- coordinate thioantimonate were detected by FT-ICR MS, and four-coordinate thioantimonate was considered as the final stable product through thermodynamic calculation. The insights gained from this study shed new light on the effect of SRB in Sb mobilization and the role of thioantimony in Sb biogeochemistry cycling.

The present research investigated the effects of coexisted Fe(II) on oxidation and adsorption of Sb(III) by MnO2 under acidic conditions. Results of kinetic experiments showed that oxidation and adsorption of Sb(III) by MnO2 were both influenced by Fe(II) in Sb(III)-Fe(II) simultaneous oxidation system and Fe(II) pretreated system. Oxidation was inhibited yet adsorption was promoted in the presence of soluble Fe(II), and both effects were enhanced with increasing ratio of Fe(II): Sb(III). Through scanning electron microscope, energy dispersive spectrometer, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, it was confirmed that Fe(III) compounds were formed around MnO2 particles, and they were the reason that caused inhibition of Sb(III) oxidation. However, two different Fe(III) compounds were formed around MnO2 particles when Fe(II) intervened experiment systems in different ways. In simultaneous oxidation system, poorly crystallized or amorphous Fe-Sb precipitates (probably FeSbO4) were formed around MnO2 particles after competitive oxidation of Sb(III) and Fe(II), while in Fe(II) pretreated oxidation system, Fe(II) pretreatment caused formation of schwertmannite around MnO2 particles. Both Fe(III) compounds prevented the direct contact of Sb(III) with MnO2 surface, but most Sb(III) could still diffuse through both Fe(III) compounds and be oxidized by MnO2, while part of the Sb(III) was adsorbed by Fe(III) compounds. The newly formed Sb(V) was firstly adsorbed by Fe(III) compounds, and then released into solution after reaching adsorption saturation. The present study revealed that Fe(II) was critical to Sb(III) oxidation and adsorption by MnO2, and the influence mechanisms were different when Fe(II) intervened the reaction systems through different ways.

Earthworms are usually considered as biological indicators to predict the bioavailability of Sb in soil and an important component of ecological risk assessments. Avoidance tests can be used as a kind of quick and cost-effective method for assessing contaminants in soils. Laboratory experiments of earthworms with series of concentrations of antimony (Sb) spiked agricultural soil were conducted in a climatron to study the chronic toxicity and avoidance response of Sb on Eisenia Fetida. The mortality rates and growth inhibition of 28d culture increased significantly when the level of Sb in the soils above 500 mg/kg. The bioaccumulation of Sb by earthworms increased with the increasing concentration of Sb in the soils, and there were no statistically significant increases in the level of Sb of the soils under 800 mg/kg. For Eisenia Fetida, significant differences(P>0.05) were found in the distribution of the worms between the untreated sides and the sides with treated soil, the avoidance response by worms decreased with the increasing concentration of Sb addition. The growth inhibition rates and bioaccumulation were both significantly correlated with the exposure dose, and might be used as sensitive indicator for ecological risk assessment of soils.

Its toxicity and mobility are strongly influenced by redox processes. Pyrite (FeS2) is the most abundant natural sulfur mineral in the earth’s crust. Pyrite is also associated with stibnite. Simultaneously, Some studies have reported that Sb(III) can be oxidized to Sb(V) both in solution and on pyrite surfaces in oxic condition. The pyrite-induced hydroxyl radical (·OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) are the main oxidants for Sb(III) oxidation. However, pyrite is thermodynamically unstable and can be oxidized in aerobic environments. It has been proposed that pyrite oxidation results in the formation of an oxidation layer on its surface. The nature of the oxidation layer on pyrite will determine the reactivity of weathered pyrite in aqueous solutions. Our interest here is the surface phase will determine how weathered pyrite might oxidize Sb(III). In this research, pyrite was exposed to air at room temperature for 1 week and the product was named SOP(O2). Aqueous pyrite oxidation experiments were also performed. In this step, pyrite samples were immersed in air-saturated water (pH=3, 5 and 7) for 1 week and SOP(H20) were obtained. Sb(III) oxidation in pyrite suspension was investigated at pH =3, 5 and 7 under oxic condition with 2μmol/L Sb(III) and 0.5 g/L pyrite. Our study showed that the oxidation efficiencies of Sb(III) by SOP(O2) were enhanced compared with by pyrite in all conditions. But the efficiencies of Sb(III) oxidation by SOP(H20) were greatly restrained at pH=3,5 and 7. We found that the ferric and ferrous (hydr)oxides were formed on the surface of SOP(O2). Besides, pyrite oxidation in water phase results in the formation of an Fe-hydroxide or Fe-oxyhydroxide layer on the surface. Thus oxidation layer on pyrite has great influence on the efficiency of Sb(III) oxidation.

LC-MS and HG-AFS are commonly used in the analysis of Sb content and speciation. However, their high prices and immobility characteristics limit the spread of these methods. Due to the unique capability of pre-concentrating analytes at/in the working electrode surface, electrochemical stripping analysis has been recognized as one of the most convenient choices for measuring trace metal ions. But except for the determination on its total concentration, the speciation determination of Sb(III) and Sb(V) by electrochemical analysis has not yet been realized in the same solution without adding any oxidizer/reductant or using complex mathematical calculations, which is mainly because of the significant difference between the electrochemical activities of Sb (III) and Sb (V) and the difficulty in separating the electrochemical signals of Sb(III) and Sb(V). The theoretical research related to photooxidation characteristic of Sb(III) is widely studied in recent years, but this feature is not well used yet. This research, based on the photooxidation characteristic of Sb(III) and the electrochemical activity difference between Sb(III) and Sb(V), realized the determination of Sb species in one electrolyte solution by anodic stripping square wave voltammetry (AS-SWV) without adding any enthetic oxygenant. The electrolyte solution used in this research was 2.0mol/L HCl. Under this condition, Sb(III) had an obvious anodic stripping peak at the enrichment potential of -0.4V. While an obvious stripping peak of Sb(V) was observed under a more negative enrichment potential of -0.9V. Therefore, the interference of Sb(V) on Sb(III) determination can be avoided under the enrichment potential of -0.4V. After the determination of Sb(III), the whole system was exposed to ultraviolet light for a suitable time to make sure all Sb(III) was oxidized to Sb(V). Then Sb(V) was detected under the enrichment potential of -0.9V, which represented the total Sb concentration (Sb(tot)) in solution. The original Sb(V) concentration was calculated by difference subtraction method with the results of Sb(tot) and Sb(III). The linear range of Sb(III) and Sb(tot) were 0.6 to 1.5μmol/L and 0.8 to 10.0μmol/L, with the detection limits of 4.21nmol/L and 5.05nmol/L, respectively.

The adsorption of Sb(III) and Sb(V) on Mn-coated biochar using batch experiments was studied in this paper. Mn-coated biochar was simply synthesized through the reaction of biochar with different MnSO4 concentrations in aqueous solution. It is confirmed the successful coating of Mn on the surface of the biochar from SEM and XRD analysis. It is showed that MnSO4 modification greatly increased the particle size of the original biochar by Laser particle size analyzer and the specific surface area of Mn-coated biochar is smaller than the untreated biochar by BET analysis. The effects of initial Sb concentration, pH, reaction time, and temperature at different concentrations on the adsorption of Sb(III) and Sb(V) were investigated in this research. Kinetic studies indicated that Sb(III) and Sb(V) reached an adsorption equilibrium within 12 hours.

The sorption process of Mn-coated biochar was pH independent. It is indicated that physical adsorption and chemical adsorption of biochar occurred together, reflected in ion exchange and redox reaction. Strong chemisorptive binding of Sb to biochar surfaces is further confirmed from FTIR and XPS.

Mine exploitation is an important source of Sb contamination, and very high levels of contamination have been detected around mine sites. Antimony mobilization is closely linked to redox state and adsorption and desorption in nature. Molybdenum (Mo) and Mo isotope can be informative of the redox conditions, moreover, Mo isotope fractionation is mainly controlled by the adsorption and desorption onto Fe/Mn-(hydr)oxides. The Mo isotope compositions were analyzed to elucidate the Sb mobilization in high Sb groundwater from the world’s largest antimony mine, Xikuangshan (XKS) Sb mine. The Mo isotope values (δ98Mo) in groundwater at XKS Sb mine range from +1.57‰ to +2.49‰ (average of +1.96‰), which are relatively heavier that those reported in fresh waters. The relationships between δ 98Mo values and Fe, Mn and Mo concentrations suggest that compared with Mn, Fe-(hydr)oxides may have a more significant effect on Mo isotope. The increased δ98Mo values with an decrease in Mo concentrations might result from the adsorption of Mo from Fe/Mn-(hydr)oxides, and also might be a consequence of the faster rate of adsorption of Mo from groundwater than the rate of desorption of Mo from Fe/Mn-(hydr)oxides. Importantly, the relationships between δ98Mo values and Sb and As concentrations further demonstrate that adsorption and desorption of Fe/Mn-(hydr)oxides are an important factor for affecting the Sb mobilization in groundwater, more specially, a competitive adsorption with As may occur. This study is the first to examine the Mo isotope compositions in high Sb groundwater mine, and the results show that the Mo isotope would be an important tool in demonstrating the migration and transformation of antimony in groundwater.

All this information emphasizes the importance of identifying and quantifying the chemical forms of antimony to provide comprehensive information about its toxicity and environmental relevance. In the aqueous environment, inorganic antimony mainly appears in the oxidation states +V and +III. In natural, non-contaminated waters, extremely low concentrations of total antimony are usually quantified. Direct speciation analysis, in this case, is practically impossible. So, many of the procedures for the selective separation/preconcentration and quantification of antimony species in natural waters are based on the coupling of a selective separation technique with a sensitive detection method. During the past years, separations and preconcentrations based on cloud point extraction (CPE) are becoming an important and practical application of the use of surfactants in analytical chemistry. The technique is based on the property of most non-ionic surfactants in aqueous solutions to form micelles and become turbid when heated to the cloud point temperature (CPT). Above the CPT, the micellar solution separates in a surfactant-rich phase of a small volume and in a diluted aqueous phase, in which the surfactant concentration is close to the critical micellar concentration (CMC). Any analyte solubilized in the hydrophobic core of the micelles, will separate and become concentrated in the small volume of the surfactant-rich phase. Metallic elements can be extracted to the surfactant-rich phase, trapped in the hydrophobic micellar core, in the form of hydrophobic complexes that are formed between the metal ion and an appropriate chelating agent under adequate conditions. The aim of the present work is to use an optimized CPE procedure for the selective separation/preconcentration of Sb(III) prior to its quantification by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). In this procedure, ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) is used as the chelating agent and Triton X-114 (TX-114) as the extracting one. Potential factors affecting the CPE separation/preconcentration of Sb(III) are investigated in detail. A certified reference material for trace elements in riverine water SLRS-4 is used for checking the accuracy of the method for the total antimony determination after reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III). Finally, the method is applied to the speciation of inorganic antimony in non-contaminated natural waters (well and lake waters).

Many of these soils are at least occasionally subject to waterlogging and the redox-sensitive metal-Sb may undergo speciation and mobility changes under periodic changes between oxic and anoxic conditions. However, the behaviour of traffic-related Sb and its controlling mechanisms are still poorly understood. We performed column experiments to investigate how redox conditions affect Sb leaching by simulated waterlogged roadside soils. Results showed clear on-off switch mobility behaviour for Sb under different redox conditions. Sb was mobilized under oxic conditions and Sb (V) was the main speciation in soil solution. With the development of anaerobic conditions upon waterlogging, Sb in leachate decreased under 5 ug/L and remained stable and the concentration of Sb(V) was lower than that under oxic condition. This was attributed to the reduction of Sb(V) to Sb(III) and the stronger sorption affinity of the latter to iron (Fe) (hydr)oxide phases. However, when the redox potential further decreased to Fe-reducing conditions, the concentration of Sb in leachate was increased. This may due to reductive dissolution of the iron (hydr)oxides.

The main goal of this work was to evaluate the effects of arsenic and antimony on the growth, anatomy, and morphology, and cell development of cultural plants. We have focused on the analysis of the negative effects of these metalloids on the roots of maize (Zea mays L.), mainly on its primary roots. Plants have been cultivated in hydroponic solutions with the increasing concentrations of tested metalloids, which correlated well with the intensity of each observed toxic effect of arsenic or antimony on the primary roots. We used the software analysis to analyse the morphological features of roots. Using light microscopy and software analysis we determined the anatomical characteristics focused on the tissue and cell level. By fluorescence microscopy we observed the development of the cell wall modifications in the endodermis and exodermis of primary root. Spectrophotometrically we determined the concentration of anthocyanins and using light microscopy we observed their location and visual difference. The most important outcomes were a reduction in the length of the primary roots even at the metalloids concentration of tenth of micromoles; changes in the area and the number of cells in each plant tissue, measured at the level perpendicular to the axis of the roots. Moreover, we observed both the changes of the anthocyanin concentration or their intracellular location in the whole root system. Additionally, the presence of both metalloids resulted in the changed cell wall composition. Predominantly, the deposition of material of apoplasmic barriers occured into the cell walls of cortical cells of the primary roots. We also observed the ontogenetic changes of endodermal and exodermal cells of primary roots dependent on the applied concentration of arsenic and antimony. Conclusion: The plant roots are sensitively responding even to very low concentrations of arsenic and antimony. The morphological reactions are complex on the level of cells, tissues and organs and further investigation will be needed to understand the control network system maintaining the homeostasis of the whole plant after influence of toxic metalloids.

Yamaguchib a Department of Environmental and Resource Sciences, Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, Japan b National institute for Agro-environmental Sciences, NARO, Japan yhashim@cc.tuat.ac.jp Cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) in the rice paddy soil are a serious public concern for people whose diet is chiefly based on rice. For rice cultivation in some temperate and (sub)tropical areas, paddy soil undergoes a long flooding (reducing) period followed by a short draining (oxidizing) period, which can alter solubility of Cd in the soil. In contrast to Cd, soil As chemistry is contrastingly different and the solubility increases more in the reducing conditions where As occurs mainly as As(III). Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy was used to understand chemical species of Cd and As in relation to their solubility and redox gradients in paddy soils. Our study found that the formation and dissolution of CdS is primarily controlled by redox potential and sulfur (S) in the soil. In the reducing period, the CdS proportion in the high-S soil was rapidly increased to 30% at day 4 and reached 90% at day 29, whereas CdS in the low-S soil did not exceed 35%. In the following oxidizing period, CdS in the soils underwent oxidative dissolution, but was not completely dissolved remaining at An excess of sulfate decreased extractable and dissolved As in the soil reducing period due to retardation of soil reduction process that decreased soluble As(III) in the soil solid phase. The As species at the end of soil reducing period were 38-41% As(V), 46-51% As(III), and 11-13% As2S3-like species, regardless of initial S treatments. In the following soil reoxidation, As2S3-like species were sensitive to oxidation and disappeared completely in the first 2 days when the Eh value increased rapidly above 160 mV. About 50% of As(III) to the total As persisted over 32 days of soil reoxidation period (Eh > 400mV), suggesting some mechanisms against oxidation of As(III) such as physical sequestration in soil microsites. Arsenic species and distribution in Fe plaque of the rice rhizosphere soil were investigated using micro-XANES spectroscopy. The result demonstrated that oxidation of As(III) to As(V) occurred faster in the Fe-plaque than the soil matrix, and As was sequestered in iron mottles originating from Fe-plaque around the roots. The ratio of As(V) to As(III) decreased toward the outer-rim of the subsurface Fe mottles where lepidocrocite occurred preferentially. These results provide direct evidence that speciation of As in proximity to roots depends on spatial and temporal redox variations in the soil matrix.

Therefore, there is an urgent requirement to reduce both Cd and As in rice grain for human health. By using different approaches, many transporters involved in the transport of Cd and As from soil to the grain have been identified in rice. Recently, attempts have been made to reduce As and Cd accumulation through manipulation of relevant transporters. For example, knockout of OsNramp5, a major transporter for Cd uptake has resulted in significant reduction of Cd in rice grain although the effect on yield was not consistent between different studies. Several studies consistently showed that over-expression of OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized transporter for vacuolar Cd sequestration resulted in decreased Cd accumulation in rice grain without yield penalty. On the other hand, knockout of Lsi1 and Lsi2, two transporters for arsenite and Si in rice, decreased accumulation of As, but also showed negative effect on the yield because Si uptake was also hampered. Recently, over-expression of OsABCC1, a node-based transporter for As distribution, under control of specific promoter, resulted in effective reduction of As in rice grain. Recent progress on molecular breeding of low-Cd rice by using low-Cd alleles will also be presented at the symposium.

Rice can accumulate toxic elements such as arsenic and cadmium, and for these elements especially, the crop water management strongly affects uptake. While a number of genes have been identify that regulate the accumulation of arsenic and cadmium in rice grains, these genes have been through the use of mutant studies, over expression or gene knockouts. While the identification of these genes have been instrumental in upstanding the processes of arsenic and cadmium accumulation in rice, there is still scope to utilise natural variation for these traits in breeding programmes. This study was developed to assess genotype by water management interaction, identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for arsenic and cadmium accumulation and propose candidate genes for lowering grain arsenic and cadmium. This study utilises the Bengal and Assam Aus Panel to conduct genome wide association (GWA) mapping for grain arsenic and cadmium in shoots and grains of grown over two years under continually flooded (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). AWD significantly reduced grain arsenic across all cultivars on average by 15.7% and 15.1% in year 1 and 2. AWD significantly increased grain cadmium across all cultivars on average by 50.0% and 92.4% in year 1 and 2 respectively compared to the plants grown under CF. There was strong cultivar by treatment interaction for grain cadmium but it was weaker for arsenic. All traits were strongly influenced by cultivar. GWA mapping identified a large number of QTLs for both arsenic and cadmium traits, with respectively six and- 26 QTLs showing stability across years and/or water treatments. Six of the loci were investigated in detail using an approach of clustering cultivars that had similar haplotypes for the QTL regions and then looking at the phenotypic values across the clusters. A number of the identified QTLs co-localised with known genes involved in arsenic (Lsi2) and cadmium (OsNRAMP5) accumulation. This study has identified a number of novel QTLs for arsenic and cadmium accumulation, as well as cultivars that consistently accumulate less of these elements over multiple field traits. The use of a haplotype clustering approach after genome wide association mapping has allowed for the affect, in terms of elemental accumulation, to be determined for cultivars that share similar genomic sequence. These haplotypes can be further investigated for their potential in breeding low arsenic and cadmium rice cultivars by utilising natural variation.

Identification of genes and the molecular mechanisms for As transport and detoxification is crucial step to develop lower As rice. Hear we identified 25 rice genes participating As resistance using yeast expression system with rice cDNA library generated from mRNA of As-treated rice roots. Among of them, AsRT1 (a zinc finger type transcription factor) exhibited the most dramatically improved As resistance in yeast cells and inhibited As accumulation through the regulation of many different mechanisms, such as As efflux, As uptake and ubiquitination in yeast. The loss of functional mutants of Arabidopsis and rice AsRT1 and AsRT2 expressing phloem in shoot less accumulated As in seeds. The calli generated from atasrt1atasrt2 exhibited enhanced As resistance and reduced As accumulation compared to those of WT. The results from As feeding assay with rosette leaves and stem of Arabidopsis and rice showed that the Arabidopsis and rice mutants had reduced As transport activity to neighbor tissues through the phloem pathway.

The location of TAs in rice grains has been evaluated by laser ablation-inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and ICP-MS, while arsenic speciation has been determined using high performance liquid chromatography-inductively coupled mass spectrometry (HPLC-ICP-MS). In this work, 256 samples were analysed for TAs and As speciation (only some representative samples by LA-ICP-MS), representing two European commercial categories (Long A grain and Long B grain groups) and 15 varieties according to their use for parboiling processes. Out of them, 53 sample pairs of paddy rice and corresponding parboiled paddy rice were collected directly from different Italian rice millers. Polished and brown rice aliquots of the same sample were also compared for TAs and As speciation. This investigation shows that the polishing process, besides modifying the physical characteristics of rice, decreases the concentration of As compared to the brown rice. Indeed, there was a statistically higher arsenic content (TAs and iAs) in brown rice than in white rice, with differences close to 50%. Removing the bran layer during polishing process is thus useful to reduce iAs in rice grain. The parboiling process, conversely, increases the As content of the polished rice grain with respect to the not parboiled white rice. The hydration and thermal phases of the parboiled process mobilize the high content of arsenic present in the bran layer, so that TAs and iAs contents in parboiled rice bran were 3-times lower than those in the bran of not parboiled rice. The As removed from the bran was though partly transferred into the endosperm, as evidenced by LA-ICP-MS, rising the overall As content of the parboiled grain. In the rice grains subjected to different industrial processes, from polishing to parboiling, the main form of As remains As(III) as iAs and DMA(V) as organic Arsenic (oAs).

Currently, groundwater of 107 countries are affected by As contamination released from predominantly geological sources, posing a serious health hazard to an estimated 150 million people worldwide. Arsenic exposure to humans mainly occurs via drinking As-contaminated water and Food crops grown in As-contaminated areas. Besides drinking water, groundwater is also used for irrigating crops during the dry season, particularly for paddy rice (Oryza sativa). Rice and vegetables are the main foods of population in Bengal delta. Transfer of As from groundwater into crops has been well documented. Arsenic in rice is an important issue as about 3 billion people around the world consume rice as staple food. In this study, we have investigated the geographical variation, cancer risks for adults due to the consumption of rice and how to reduce As from paddy rice using water management options. For this study, we collected and analyzed 965 rice samples from 20 districts of Bangladesh. Districts were selected based on the As concentrations (severely, moderately and less affected) in groundwater. Digestion of the rice samples for total As analysis was carried out as per standard protocol. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer (ICP-MS) was used to determine the amount of total As. Two water management options such as continuous flooding (CF) and alternative wet and dry (AWD) were used to see the variation of As uptake in 10 rice cultivars. The analytical results showed that As concentration in rice grain varied from 3-680 µg/kg (dry weight). Arsenic levels in rice are dominated by the location and variety. Dietary exposure to inorganic As from rice poses potentially serious risks (both carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic). Daily intake of inorganic As from rice ranged between 0.38 and 1.92 μg/kg BW. The female groups are more susceptible than male groups while the 2–5 and 6–10 age groups are supposed to be more exposed to As from rice consumption. The results from water management study showed that significant yield difference among the cultivars under CF and AWD irrigation. The AWD irrigation significantly increased grain yields for around 38% over CF. The variety with the highest yield was Binadhan-8 (7.0 t/ha) followed by Binadhan-6 and BRRI dhan58 (6.8 t/ha).

In southern China, rice safety is threatened by elevated concentrations of toxic metal(loid)s accumulating in rice grain. Mining related industries in this ore-rich region extensively dispersed metal(loid)s to streams and rivers which were used for irrigation of rice paddies leading to soil contamination. Among toxic metal(loid)s accumulated in paddy soils, cadmium (Cd) is of particular concern due to its high mobility and soil-to-rice grain transfer factor in acidic soils, which are typical in southern China, as well as its long biological half-life in humans (>10 years) after ingestion. The objective of this study was to reveal if rice grain Cd can be related to soil physico-chemical characteristics at a relatively large regional scale, which may be used to predict rice grain Cd based on an empirical model. A previous study by Simmons and co-workers demonstrated CaCl2 extractable Cd using field-moist soil instead of conventionally air-dried soil during grain-filling allowed reliable prediction of rice grain Cd for 20 fields along a 3 km length of the Mae Tao Creek in Thailand. However, it remains unclear whether similar moist soil extraction can serve as a general test method to predict rice Cd for paddy soils having strongly varying soil physico-chemical characteristics. For this, we collected 35 paired soil-rice grain samples across five provinces in southern China at the time when rice was ready to be harvested during October to November 2017. Soil extraction with 0.01 M CaCl2 was conducted on site with field-moist soil immediately during sampling to avoid changes in Cd speciation. For comparison, soil extractions were also performed post-sampling in the laboratory using air-dried soils. Element concentrations as analyzed in field-moist soil extracts and in rice grains together with total soil analyses were used as input variables in an explorative algorithm implemented in the R software to generate best multi-variable regression models for rice Cd. We found that rice Cd correlated more strongly to extractable Cd from field-moist soils (R2=0.54) when compared to extractable Cd using air-dried soils (R2=0.27). This may be due to oxidation of Cd sulfides during drying, leading to a co-mobilization of Cd and S. Our data analysis indicated that field-moist soil extractable Cd and Fe formed the best two-variable model for rice Cd (Rrob2=0.64) with extractable Cd contributing 89% to the model-explained variance in rice Cd. Our study demonstrated that 0.01 M CaCl2 extraction at rice harvest using field-moist soil was able to predict rice Cd at a relatively large regional scale with ranged soil physico-chemical properties. Based on the findings presented in this study, bioavailable Cd accumulating in the rice grain may reliably and quickly be tested by 0.01 M CaCl2 extraction.

Rice is efficient in accumulating As in grains, thus rice consumption has become the main route of dietary As intake for populations consuming rice as the staple food. Organic substances are recommended to be added to the soil for carbon sequestration and soil fertility. However, organic substances application has been demonstrated to remarkably influence As mobility and transformation in soil. Straw incorporation is widely performed in As contaminated paddy fields. Our results showed that rice straw application significantly increased the abundance of iron-reducing bacterium, and the significant positive correlation between dissolved As with Fe and the abundance of iron-reducing bacterium suggested the coupling of As and Fe reduction mediated by iron-reducing bacterium. In addition, rice straw application significantly increased the abundance of methanogenic bacteria, and the significant positive correlation between DMA in rice grains and the abundance of methanogenic bacteria indicated that methanogenic bacteria could be involved in As methylation after straw application. From this study, it is clealy demonstrated that rice straw application significantly enhanced As release from iron minerals and promoted As(V) reduction to As(III) in soil, accelerated As methylation, enhanced As volatilization and elevated DMA accumulation in polished grains, but decreased As(III) accumulation. Rice straw can be degraded to humic substances (HS) by microorganisms in the soil. Humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) are dominating humic substances (HS) in soil. We found that fulvic acid addition caused significant enrichment of Desulfitobacterium (41-fold), and significantly increased the concentrations of As (12-fold), iron (Fe; 20-fold), manganese (Mn; 3-fold) and acetic acid (3-fold) in soil porewater. In contrast, HA slightly increased the concentrations of As (1.2-fold) in porewater, and little effect on Fe, Mn and acetic acid. Under both FA and HA treatments, As was primarily complexed with HS, only a small fraction of free As was available for methylation. Therefore, although there was abundant putative As methylating microorganisms, such as Methanobacterium and Methanosarcinaceae, As methylation was limited. These results illustrated that different organic substances exhibited different effects of on As mobility and transformation in paddy soil through regulating soil microbial community.

The transporters for As uptake and metabolism have been elucidated and target genes have been identified in different plants, which may offer effective approaches to reduce As accumulation in plants, especially in some important crops. Arsenite (AsIII) antiporter ACR3 is critical for As metabolism in organisms, but it is lost in flowering plants. Here, a novel ACR3 gene from As hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata, PvACR3;1, was cloned and expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Arabidopsis thaliana (model plant), and Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco). Yeast experiments showed that PvACR3;1 functioned as an AsIII-antiporter to mediate AsIII efflux to an external medium. At 5 μM AsIII, PvACR3;1 transgenic Arabidopsis accumulated 14−29% higher As in the roots and 55−61% lower As in the shoots compared to WT control, showing lower As translocation. Besides, transgenic tobacco under 5 μM AsIII or AsV also showed similar results, indicating that expressing PvACR3;1 increased As retention in plant roots. Moreover, observation of PvACR3;1−green fluorescent protein fusions in transgenic Arabidopsis showed that PvACR3;1 localized to the vacuolar membrane, indicating that PvACR3;1 mediated AsIII sequestration into vacuoles, consistent with increased root As. In addition, soil experiments showed ~22% lower As in the shoots of transgenic tobacco than control. Based on the above results, we also transformed PvACR3;1 gene into rice (Oryza sativa L.), which is the staple food for half of the world’s population and also an efficient accumulator of As. Similar to Arabidopsis and tobacco, transgenic rice also showed higher As retention in plant roots and lower As translocation to the aboveground tissues. More importantly, When grown in flooded soils with As, expressing PvACR3;1 significantly reduced inorganic As accumulation in brown rice by >20%, significant for controlling As exposure risk from rice. Thus, our study provides a potential strategy to limit As accumulation in rice, shedding light on engineering low-As crops to improve food safety.

Seyfferth Department of Plant and Soil Sciences, University of Delaware, United States of America flinam@udel.edu Arsenic and cadmium are contaminants of concern in many rice-growing regions, such as Southeast Asia. Arsenic is a concern due to the geology and the increased mobility and toxicity of As under reduced/flooded soil conditions. Methylated As species (MMA, DMA, TMAO, e.g.) are formed by microbes in flooded rice paddies and can accumulate in rice grain. Arsenic can limit rice yield through straighthead disorder and is also toxic to humans. Minimizing flooding can lower As mobility, but increases Cd mobility in acidic soils and decreases yield. Strategies that minimize both As and Cd uptake while minimizing yield loss are critically needed. The benefits of Si to rice are well known, and these include yield increases and resistance to environmental stressors. Recent research suggests that increasing Si may limit uptake of As via competition of silicic acid and arsenous acid for transporters, and Cd via several mechanisms including increasing soil pH, growth dilution, and retention in cell walls. Release of Si through soil mineral dissolution is slow, and plant available Si is dominated by biogenic sources such as plant residues that are Si-rich such as rice husks. We posit that biochar of rice husk can be optimized for maximum retention of organic As forms as well as Cd2+. The properties of biochar are altered by production parameters such as feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature. Therefore, we investigated the physicochemical changes of rice husk biochar created at various pyrolysis temperatures to determine the biochar for maximum sorption of Cd and organic As species. A key factor was the decrease in biochar surface functional groups seen at high pyrolysis temperatures. Pyrolysis of rice crop residues can transform many of the minerals present, including Si. Thus, we also investigated the effect of biochar production parameters on Si availability. Total Si supply and rate of Si dissolution were evaluated, showing maximum release rate at low pyrolysis temperatures. Through correlation of these results, optimal pyrolysis conditions were identified to maximize both contaminant sorption and Si release to soil by rice husk biochar. Next, we performed sorption and desorption isotherms of organic As species MMA and DMA and Cd2+ onto biochars created at different temperatures. We also examined the effects of different biochar additions on methylated As species production in paddy soil, to test if amendment addition provided substrates for methylation. These data provide insight into methylation dynamics in rice paddy soil, and the potential for, and nature of, organometallic sorption by biochar. These optimized biochars can have applications for rice paddies as well as in water treatment to minimize human exposure to As and Cd.

Cd contamination in rice grains poses a potential health risk. The typical pre-harvest drainage of paddy fields, coinciding with the rice grain filling stage, can result in substantial mobilization of Cd in contaminated soils, thereby causing elevated concentrations of Cd in the rice grain. However, the processes controlling the mobilization of Cd during soil drainage remains unknown. Using microcosm incubations with twelve field-contaminated paddy soils varying widely with soil properties, we investigated the factors controlling temporal changes in Cd solubility in paddy soils. Generally, soluble and extractable Cd concentrations decreased rapidly upon flooding but increased again during the oxidation phase, with Cd solubility (aqueous Cd/soil Cd) largely depending upon porewater pH. The decrease in both soluble Cd and extractable Cd during the reducing phase did not appear to be related to the major sulfate reduction. Furthermore, inhibiting sulfate reduction using an inhibitor of sulfate-reducing bacteria in the reduction phase or inhibiting oxidation dissolution of Cd-sulfides through gamma irradiation during the oxidation phase had no or little effect on the mobilization of Cd in the subsequent oxidation phase. Sequential extraction revealed that changes in Cd availability were largely dependent upon the transformation of Cd between the Fe-Mn (oxyhydro)oxide fraction and exchangeable fraction during both soil flooding and the oxidation phases. A concomitant decrease in soil pH upon drainage of acid soils resulted in desorption of Cd from Fe-Mn (oxyhydr)oxides, with this being responsible for the elevated mobilization of Cd upon soil drainage. Taken together, our results indicate that Fe-Mn (oxyhydr)oxides, rather than oxidation of sulfides, play a critical (and prevalent) role in controlling the mobilization of Cd upon soil drainage in paddy systems.

Previous research indicated that increasing concentration of silicic acid in soil solutions may mitigate As uptake by rice. However, some studies also found that silicic acid can desorb arsenite (iAsIII) from soil solid phase and lead to an increase in As uptake by rice. Therefore, further clarification of comprehensive effects of silicic acid applied on paddy field is necessary. Two rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars including TK9 (japonica) and TCS 10 (indica) commonly planted in Taiwan were used in this study, which were grown in two As-contaminated paddy fields located at Minsyong (Ms) and Guandu Plain (Gd), Taiwan, where soil As concentration are 20-110 mg/kg and 100-240 mg/kg, respectively. Based on recommended application rate of 750 kg SiO2 ha-1, there are four calcium silicate application rates: 0 kg (Si0), 750 kg (Si1), 1500 kg (Si2), 3000kg (Si4) SiO2 ha-1 used in this study. The results show that the As concentration in brown rice of TK9 and TCS10 cultivars grown in Gd field were decreased about 15% and 20% after Si application, respectively, which decreased by 2-7% and had no significant difference in Ms soils. In addition, it was observed that the main As species in brown rice was iAsIII and DMA, and the proportion of iAsIII was higher than DMA. Moreover, it was also found that the As concentration in shoot were significantly reduced after Si application, and the extents of decrease in As concentrations of shoot in Gd field was higher than Ms field. The results of growth index show the shoot biomass and grain yield of two tested rice cultivars grown in Gd field under Si treatments were decreased, which may be resulted from As phytotoxicity. However, there was no significant growth inhibition was observed in Ms field. Based on the above results, it suggests the Si application can reduce the As (inorganic As) accumulation in brown rice, the extents of decrease were controlled by the soil properties, As concentrations and rice cultivars. Therefore, it needs to consider these factors when Si fertilizer is applied to As-contaminated paddy soils.

Therefore, a fundamental understanding of processes that control Cd accumulation in crops is crucial. Currently, we are investigating Cd behaviour in rice by combining synchrotron solid state speciation analysis with Cd isotope process tracing in contaminated soil-rice systems. The main principle of the combined approach is that (i) synchrotron solid state speciation techniques (XANES) identify snapshots of Cd speciation in soil and rice compartments at the time of sampling (ii) while mass balances and isotope ratios provide information on how Cd speciation control the mobility of Cd during plant growth. With this combined approach, we aim to provide a holistic view on major processes that determine the Cd distribution in distinct soil-rice systems. To this end, we grew rice (Oryza sativa L.) in pots that contained wet and flooded soils that were spiked with 15 mg kg-1 Cd. We grew two rice accessions: Taichung and TCM213, which respectively have functional and non-functional OsHMA3, a tonoplast-localized Cd transporter. At flowering stage, we collected bulk soil, roots, and shoots. During plant growth, we frequently collected soil solution and analyzed pH, Eh, TOC, major cations and anions, Fe, Zn, and Cd concentrations as well Cd isotopes to model Cd speciation in soil solution using PHREEQC. Prior isotope analysis using MC-ICPMS, soil and plant samples were purified using a one stage anion exchange chromatography. For bulk XANES analysis, samples were frozen with liquid nitrogen immediately after their harvest. At the conference, we will show Cd mass balances, Cd isotope, and Cd speciation data of flooded and non flooded soil-rice systems. Overall, we expect that S ligands will strongly determine the mobility of Cd in the entire soil-rice system. First soil solution data showed that the different soil redox states caused contrasting soil properties that control the solubility of Cd in the soil such as pH, Fe2+ concentrations, and total dissolved organic carbon. We expect that dissolution of Fe-oxides and sulfide formation in the flooded soils will alter Cd binding sites in the soil and thus also the Cd isotope ratios in soil solution and plants. Within the rice, we expect that the retention of Cd in the roots is not only determined by its functional HMA3 transporter but also by a Cd immobilization through enhanced binding to S ligands in vacuoles. Consequently, a larger fraction of Cd bound to S should be accompanied by a strong enrichment of light isotopes in roots in wild type compared to mutant rice. The outcomes of this pot trial will be integrated into current conceptual models of Cd isotope fractionation and Cd transport in soil-plant systems.

Arsenic thiolation, the formation of soluble inorganic thioarsenates (AsVS-IInO4-n3-, with n=1-4) and methylated thioarsenates ((AsVS-IIn(CH3)O3-n3- or AsVS-IIn(CH3)2O2-n3- with n=1-3) under sulfate-reducing conditions, has to date seldom been considered in soil environments. Inorganic thioarsenates are structural analogues to arsenate and formed from arsenite, zerovalent sulfur, and sulfide. How methylated thioarsenates form in nature has not been investigated, yet, but in synthetic solutions they are formed from the reaction between methylated arsenates and microbially produced sulfide. Studies of 31 distinct paddy fields across China using standardized soil anaerobic incubations revealed widespread occurrence of arsenic thiolation over various environmental gradients. The magnitude of arsenic thiolation was comparable to methylation, with thioarsenates contributing in sum up to 29% to total arsenic. Sulfate addition generally increased total arsenic thiolation, but with only minor impacts on its large scale distribution. The geographic pattern of total arsenic thiolation was intrinsically determined by variations in soil parameters, and was largely correlated with total zerovalent sulfur formed anaerobically. The speciation of thioarsenates was strongly driven by soil pH values. Methylated thioarsenates dominated in acidic paddy soils, whereas inorganic thioarsenates dominated in neutral and alkaline paddy soils. Both inorganic and methylated thioarsenates were found to be partially decomposed after soil drainage, but all species were also discovered after re-flooding. Further soil oxidation experiments proved that thioarsenates oxidized the fastest the more thio-groups they had. Dimethylmonothioarsenate showed the highest stability upon prolonged oxidation. Given the ubiquitous occurrence of arsenic and sulfur, we suggest that thioarsenate formation as well as their environmental fate need to be deciphered in future paddy soil arsenic studies.

Organic and inorganic As are also present in most foodstuffs. Contribution of each food category to daily total (both inorganic and organic) As intake of the Japanese was estimated. Fish and shellfish contributed the greatest to total daily intake, followed by seaweed and rice. As compound present in fish and shellfish is mostly arsenobetaine and in seaweed is mostly arsenosugar; both are organic As and considered virtually nontoxic. Meanwhile, inorganic As [arsenate and arsenite] is more toxic than organic As. Two food items— rice and hijiki seaweed, a brown alga Sargassum fusiforme,—were estimated as major contributors to daily inorganic As intake in the Japanese population. Because rice is a globally important food crop, the Codex Alimentarius Commission set the maximum levels for inorganic As in white rice in 2014 (0.2 mg kg-1) and brown rice in 2016 (0.35 mg kg−1). According to a survey of rice As concentrations by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan, approximately 5 % of brown rice cultivated in Japan collected in 2012 contained inorganic As at the concentration higher than 0.35 mg kg−1, and the average concentration (n = 600) of inorganic As was 0.21 mg kg−1 for brown rice. It was higher than that in brown rice collected from 2004 to 2006 (n=600) by 0.15 mg kg−1, so we examined the cause of the difference. For twenty years (1996-2015), rice plants had been cultivated in a paddy field at our institute under flooding condition before and after heading. The field experiments show positive correlation between temperature after rice heading stage and inorganic As concentration in rice grain. Global warming will increase temperature in rice growing areas, which could result in higher concentration of inorganic As in rice grain. To verify the effect of high temperature on As concentration in rice grain, we conducted a pot experiment in temperature gradient chambers (TGC). A chamber was divided into zones of three different temperature (TGC1, TGC2, TGC3). Twenty seedlings per pot were circular-dense-transplanted, and transferred into each TGC one week after heading time and harvested at maturity. Average air temperature from one week after heading to harvest time were 27.0 °C (TGC1), 28.3 °C (TGC2) and 29.3 °C (TGC3). Rice inorganic As concentration were ranked as TGC3 > TGC2 > TGC1. There was a significant negative correlation between inorganic As concentration and thousand‐kernel weight.

Arsenic is ubiquitously present in soils and mobilized during rice cultivation on flooded paddy soils by reductive dissolution of iron minerals. Recently, methylated thioarsenates (HAsSxO4−(x+y)(CH3)y2−, x;y =1-2) and inorganic thioarsenates (HAsSxO4−x2−, x =1-4) have been reported to occur in paddy fields besides the better-known oxyarsenates. Inorganic thioarsenates are structural analogues to arsenate and form under sulfur-reducing conditions from arsenite via OH-/SH- ligand exchange and addition of zerovalent sulfur. Methylated thioarsenates form via ligand exchange of OH-/SH- in mono- (MMA) or dimethylarsenate (DMA) molecules. Sulfur (S) addition is one driver for the occurrence of thiolation, even though naturally occurring S concentrations are sufficient for As thiolation in paddy soils. Sulfur fertilization has recently been suggested to lower grain As concentration, however, no conclusive data have been obtained so far. Even though methylated thioarsenates are highly toxic for humans, no data about uptake, transformation or translocation of methylated thioarsenates in plants are available until now. Using hydroponic experiments with 20-day-old rice plants, we showed that monomethylmonothioarsenate (MMMTA), dimethylmonothioarsenate (DMMTA), and monothioarsenate (MTA) were taken up by rice roots and could be detected in the xylem. Total arsenic translocation from roots to shoots was higher for plants exposed to DMMTA, MTA, and DMA compared to MMMTA and MMA. Our experiments revealed that all thioarsenates were partially transformed in the presence of rice roots, but processes and extents differed. MMMTA was subject to abiotic oxidation and largely dethiolated to MMA outside the plant by root oxygen loss (ROL). DMMTA and MTA were not oxidized by ROL. Inside roots, MTA was rapidly enzymatically reduced to arsenite, while DMMTA transformation to DMA was not enzymatically catalyzed and much slower. While MMMTA and MTA seem to be less critical for food safety, based on current knowledge, DMMTA behaves differently as uptake and total As translocation are high. Although DMMTA is mostly transformed to DMA, it is the only As species besides arsenite, arsenate, MMA and DMA that has ever been detected in rice grains before. DMMTA is highly toxic, comparable to inorganic As, but co-determined as DMA using common acid extraction for rice grains as the acid converts DMMTA to DMA. This is especially problematic, as DMA is not considered toxic and exempt from food guidelines. Contribution of DMMTA and total As in rice grains especially after S fertilization needs to be further investigated and potentially both standard extraction methods and guidelines need to be adapted.

Although management options including alternative wetting and drying or upland rice farming are effective approaches to reduce As uptake and accumulation, rice yield penalty is a big concern. Continuous flooding enhances rice production that is crucial for a growing global population, but enhances As bioavailability. The dilemma requires new insights and transformative approaches to control the As speciation and uptake in rice paddies. An emerging trend in the U.S. water bodies is the gradually increasing nitrate and perchlorate levels. Both chemicals are strong oxidants which can potentially oxidize As in the absence of molecular oxygen (e.g. under flooded irrigation) and consequently alter As speciation. We conducted a greenhouse study including three treatments with addition of nitrate only (10 mg/L NaNO3), perchlorate only (50 µg/L NaClO4), or mixed nitrate and perchlorate (10 mg/L NaNO3+ 50 µg/L NaClO4) as well as one control treatment (no nitrate and perchlorate) throughout the life cycle of rice. The results showed that the presence of nitrate or perchlorate increased the rice grain yield compared to the control treatment, although larger standard deviation was observed in the perchlorate treatment (six replicates). The mixed nitrate and perchlorate treatment also increased the rice grain yield, but the increase was more moderate. The total As was lower in all treatments with nitrate and/or perchlorate compared with the control, with the perchlorate alone treatment caused most reduction. As speciation analysis in plant tissues suggested that the altered As uptake was caused by the modified As speciation by the co-existing oxidizing agents. Organic As was dominant As species in rice grains, especially di-methylarsinic acid (DMA), accounting 66-76% of total As, while inorganic As was predominant in rice straws and roots in all the treatments. In summary, the presence of nitrate and perchlortae in irrigation water significantly decreased the As uptake and accumulation while enhancing the rice yield, which indicates the application of continuous flooding with oxidizing compounds as a sustainable As management strategy.

Intermittent flooding constitutes a successful measure in reducing As-grain level; however, it is an uncommon practice for rice production in Asia as compared to continuous flooding and can limit rice yield. Arsenite (AsIII)–natural organic matter (NOM) complexes under strong reducing conditions have been documented as an effective mechanism for As sequestration in terrestrial wetlands, yet the contribution of NOM on As bioavailability in the soil-plant system remains unresolved. Herein, we examined the effects of organic sulfur (manure) and inorganic sulfur (sulfur powder) on As bioavailability in an As-laden soil and rice grown under continuously flooded conditions. Soil incorporation of organic and inorganic sulfur materials significantly (pIII concentration in grain by 65% and 61%, respectively. The As solubility data revealed that As associated with sulfides and resistant minerals were the dominant As pools in the sulfur-amended soil, demonstrating the formation of As sulfides using reductive precipitation. Our results shade light on the potential use of sulfur materials in decreasing grain As concentration under continuous anaerobic conditions. Moreover, such flooded conditions efficiently promote the metal sulfide precipitates, which advocate the proper water management regimes for reducing grain Cd level in contaminated soils. The combined use of sulfur material with continuous flooding management is proposed to be a promising practice to diminish both As and Cd levels in rice grown in As/Cd co-contaminated soils.

Tradeoff relationships have been recognized between dissolved As and Cd in soil, and between As and Cd in rice grains. Recent studies, however, have suggested the possibility of simultaneous suppression of As and Cd concentrations in rice grains by appropriate water management strategies. A key notion underlying the strategies is that dissolved As is rapidly immobilized once the air-filled porosity of soil exceeds a threshold value upon drainage, whereas solubilization of Cd is a slower process which continues after the completion of As immobilization. This leads to a hypothesis that by conducting intermittent irrigations with an appropriate drained period, dissolved As and Cd concentrations are simultaneously kept at low levels, resulting in suppression of their uptake by rice plants. The objective of this study was to find an optimal intermittent irrigation interval for reducing rice grain As while minimizing the increase in rice grain Cd. The study was comprised of Field Experiments I and II, both of which examined the effects of intermittent irrigation during preheading 3 weeks and postheading 3 weeks on dissolved as well as rice grain As and Cd concentrations. In Field Experiment I conducted in four fields, intermittent irrigations with different irrigation intervals (4–10 days) were compared. Intermittent irrigations with a drained period of 3 days or longer substantially lowered dissolved As concentration in soil during postharvest 3 weeks, which was critical to rice grain As. Intermittent irrigation repeating 3-day flooding and 4-day drainage was capable of achieving acceptably low levels of rice grain As and Cd concentrations simultaneously. In Field Experiment II, feasibility of this intermittent irrigation strategy with 3-day flooding and 4-day drainage was further tested at 21 sites for two years. On average, rice grain inorganic As concentration was lowered by 38% relative to the continuous flooding at sites where the latter exceeded 0.2 mg kg−1. Adverse effects on rice grain Cd, grain yield and quality were minimized in most cases. Further field experiments are in progress to develop a more versatile water management strategy to reduce rice grain As and Cd concentrations.

Redox cycling of iron is known to control As mobility and bioavailability, and soil amendment with different Fe-based products is now a recommended farming practice for enhancing iron redox reactivity and reducing As uptake by rice. However, it is not known when it is the best time over the entire rice growth stage for intervention that can maximize the cost-benefit with such a practice. This study investigated arsenic mobility and bioavailability in paddy soil amended with different iron constituents over the entire growth stage of rice plant. Pot experiments were conducted using the same soil amended with: (1) amorphous Fe oxide, (2) FeCl2, (3) FeCl2+NaNO3, along with two control soils of (4) the untreated soil (control) and (5) amended with NaNO3. Samples of soil, rice plant (whole plant sample and samples of grain, straw, and root fractions) and Fe plaque on roots were collected at each of the four rice growth stages of tillering, jointing, heading, and maturation stages. The results showed that the whole rice plant at the heading stage had the highest As contents. Significantly positive correlations were found between the concentration of dissolved As in soil at the heading stage and grain As or straw As at the maturation stage, indicating the important contribution of bioavailable As at the heading stage to As uptake in rice plants at the maturation stage. In addition, As transfer coefficient from roots to the rice plant tissues above the ground showed a decreasing trend at the heading stage, indicating a lower translocation of As from roots to shoots at this stage. The study suggested that the heading stage may be the key stage for intervention in order to reduce As uptake by rice. Meanwhile, Fe plaques at the root surface can reduce As mobility and bioavailability by direct adsorption of As. Our data showed that the concentrations of the mobile As in soils were negatively correlated with the As contents in Fe plaques. It appears that application of Fe-based products in soil for reducing As accumulation in rice is a very promising practice.

In addition, Cd mobility has hardly been investigated in soils with a realistic concentration of total Cd. We successfully accounted for the dynamics of Cd solubility in a paddy soil that contained 0.36 mg kg-1 total Cd after flooding and re-drying by monitoring multiple soil chemical and microbial properties. After flooding, the addition of rice straw promoted greater microbial iron reduction and greater increase in soil pH compared to the control and treatments with added gypsum or hematite. Consequently, dissolved soil Cd decreased from 34 μg kg-1 to under the detection limit in a week when straw was added but remained high even after eight weeks in the control (13 μg kg-1) and treatments with added hematite (8 μg kg-1) or gypsum (12 μg kg-1). After re-drying, dissolved Cd in the straw-amended soil increased but was still lower than other three treatments after five weeks. The results suggest OM addition is efficient to immobilize soil Cd at a realistically low concentration by stimulating microbial reductions of soil native oxidized components after flooding, while adding extra iron oxide or sulfate alone is not effective because it cannot remove the limitation by OM availability.

Arsenite oxidation can be accelerated by bacterial catalysis, but the effects of bacterial catalysis on accelerated As(III) oxidation in flooded paddy soil are poorly understood. Herein we investigated how an arsenite-oxidizing bacterium GD03, namely Achromobacter xylosoxidans, influences As(III) oxidation in flooded paddy soil, As(III) toxicity and translocation from paddy soil to rice grain. Rice seedlings of Guang You Ming 118 (GYM) at four-leaf-stage was inoculated with different inoculation percent of GD03 into potting soil added by 100 mg/kg As(III) to investigate the effect of GD03 on accelerated As(III) oxidation in flooded paddy soil and its effects on arsenic toxicity and translocation from paddy soil to rice grain. The results showed that GD03 significantly (p 9 CFU GD03 /kg soil had the highest Eh value and the lowest As(III) concentration in soil solution of indica cultivar GYM stressed by As(III) from 1 d’s inoculation till Maturation Stage and showed the best subdued As(III) toxicity at its each growth stage. The inoculation of GD03 led to 59% to 96% increase in rice grain yield, as well as 35% to 57% of As(III) concentration decrease in rice grain. Therefore, the accelerated oxidation for As(III) in flooded paddy soil was a promising method to mitigate As(III) induced human health risk.

Root is the first barrier of Cd uptake in plant. Roots secrete an enormous range of compounds into the surrounding soil to adapt various environments (i.e., heavy metal stress). Rice tends to accumulate high quantity of Cd, and is the major source of dietary Cd intake in rice-eating populations. However, the impacts of root exudates on Cd uptake and transport in rice have largely been overlooked. Here, we hypothesize that metabolic up-regulation of the key root exudates to sequester/exclude Cd would inhibit Cd uptake in Cd-tolerant rice by forming Cd-complex. To test this hypothesis, two rice cultivars with contrasting Cd tolerance and accumulation were selected to conduct root exudations collection and metabolic profiling analysis by hydroponic culture under 25 μM Cd stress. The results showed that Cd inhibited the growth of the sensitive cultivar while the tolerant one was promoted compared with the control because of the lower Cd uptake, translocation and oxidative damage. Under Cd stress, the tolerant cultivar tended to develop more adventitious roots, and have greater root length, surface area, root volume and number of tips while those root parameters of the sensitive one were reduced, compared to the control. Cadmium addition inhibited the uptake of trace elements (Cu, Mn, Mg and Fe), the concentration of which had a significant negative correlation with shoot Cd concentration. Metabolomics data revealed that Cd triggered significant metabolic changes in root exudates which are significantly different between the two rice cultivars, and three compounds were identified and assumed to be potential biomarkers. The root exudate metabolic changes revealed an active defence mechanism against Cd stress. Together, this work demonstrates that root exudates metabolomics is a good tool to reveal the detoxification mechanism of Cd tolerance in rice.

High-Cd accumulating rice varieties (henceforce: high-Cd rice), especially, are desirable to remove Cd from paddy soils. However, such varieties so far are all indica-type and they are not suitable for the practical cultivation in Japan because of high shattering and easy lodging habit, resulting in unfit for mechanical harvesting. In this study, we attempted to develop practical high Cd varieties with non-shattering and lodging resistance that are suitable for the Japanese rice cultivation systems. Three practical high Cd rice varieties were developed: A variety name \"Phytoremediation CD No.1\" is characteristics of non-shattering and lodging resistance with short culm. This variety was produced by a gamma ray mutation method from an indica-type, a high-Cd rice variety “Jarjan”. \"Phytoremediation CD No. 2\" is non-shattering and strong culm. This variety was developed by crossing of “Jarjan” and “Tachisugata” which is a rice variety for whole crop silage use. DNA markers were used to introduce Jarjan OsHMA3 allele showing high-Cd accumulation and Tachisugata qSH1 allele showing a non-shattering habit. \"Phytoremediation CD No.3\" is also non-shattering and lodging resistance. In addition, this variety showed substantially high-Cd accumulation ability via pyramiding of several genes of high-Cd traits. In four field trials, the amounts of Cd accumulation in aerial part of \"Phytoremediation CD No.1\" was 3.6 to 16.7 times higher than those of leading edible japonica rice varieties (control varieties). \"Phytoremediation CD No.2\" accumulated Cd at 7.0 to 14.2 times higher than the control varieties, and \"Phytoremediation CD No.3\" showed 7.7 to 12.1 times higher than the controls. We achieved producing three new varieties carrying necessary traits of high-Cd accumulation, non-shattering, and lodging resistance. In addition, we confirmed that these varieties have high practicability for phytoextraction use in the Japanese paddy fields. We expect that use of these varieties for extracting Cd will be a good method to reduce Cd concentrations in edible rice grains.

Wilsona a School of Environmental and Rural Science, University of New England, Australia hgunadas@myune.edu.au Overuse of agrochemicals, combined with a suite of little controlled industrial activities, have resulted in metal(loid) contamination of agricultural soils in many parts of the world with often serious impacts on human health and the environment. The Dry Zone of Sri Lanka has one of the world’s highest incidents of chronic kidney disease (CKD) with more than 30,000 reported related deaths. Exposure to cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) sourced from the agrochemicals used in rice farming has been proposed as one of the possible causes. The aims of this study were, to examine As and Cd in the soils and rice seeds of dry zone Sri Lanka and to understand factors influencing contaminant sorption and risk. Surface soil samples (0–15 cm) were collected using grid systematic sampling for two consecutive years (2017 and 2018) from four different locations including three CKD hotspots Giradurukotte (G), Madawachchiya (M) and Padaviya (P) and a non-affected area Hambanthota (H) in the Dry Zone, Sri Lanka. Soils for each sampling location were characterised and analysed for total Cd and As as well as other trace elements. Rice seeds from the four (4) locations were also analysed. Subsequently, a series of sorption experiments using two soils, sandy loam (pH = 7.25) (A) and sandy clay loam (pH = 4.95) (B) with similar characteristics to dry zone soil in Sri Lanka were used to understand factors influencing the concentrations and mobilisation of the two contaminants in the Sri Lankan soils. All data was analysed with R version 3.5.0. For the field soils in 2017, the mean As and Cd concentrations were 0.99 mg kg-1 (0.00-3.50 mg kg-1) and 0.63 mg kg-1 (0.00-7.32 mg kg-1), respectively. There were a significant differences in Cd (H = 94.13, df = 3, pp-1 (0.00-3.85 mg kg-1)) and Cd (2.19 mg kg-1 (1.20-11.21 mg kg-1)) at all locations compared to 2017. Nevertheless, the As and Cd concentrations detected in all samples collected in dry zone paddy soils were less than sensitive land use health investigation levels (HIL) in Australia (As-100 mg kg-1 and Cd-20 mg kg-1). The As/Cd concentrations of rice samples were all ≤ 0.1mg kg-1, and less than food standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) guideline values for Cd (0.1 mg kg-1) and As (1 mg kg-1) in rice. The sorption of As and Cd on Soil A and B were best-fit with the Freundlich model. The sorption experiments revealed that soil pH had an important influence on As and Cd Kd values, with significantly lower As sorption in soil A, and lower Cd sorption in the more acidic Soil B. Synergistic and antagonistic effects on sorption of the co-occurring contaminants were evident. This represents the first systematic study of As and Cd in some of the CKD affected areas in Sri Lanka. The paddy soils sampled were indeed slightly contaminated but not to concentrations that would be expected to result in significant risk. The sorption experiments showed that the contaminant concentrations in the soils were directly affected by the soil and the co-contaminant. To fully understand the risk presented by As and Cd in the affected environment, and the factors that may be influencing concentrations in soils and the wider environment additional work should target.

Moreover, Cd accumulation in rice grains poses a potential health risk via the food chain and was also the major contributor to the human intake of Cd worldwide, especially in Asia. Therefore, based on diffusive gradient in thin-film (DGT) and planar optodes (PO), the two-dimensional dynamics and toxicity of Cd and the mechanism in situ that control the solubility of Cd yellow pigment and Cd bioavailability in rice rhizosphere were investigated for better evaluating environmental exposure. The results showed that although Cd yellow pigment was insoluble complex, Cd can be released from the Cd yellow pigment and entered into the soil solution, which can be influenced by the bacterial activity. The rice rhizosphere altered solubility of the Cd yellow pigment and Cd distribution in the rhizosphere, enhancing the potential risk of Cd yellow pigment. Different O2 saturation in the rhizosphere can influence bioavailability of Cd from Cd yellow pigment through the change of Fe(II) mobilization and the oxidation of S2- to SO42-. An acidification and chelation in the rhizosphere may be also one of the reason for enhancing Cd concentration in the rhizosphere than the bulk soil. High-throughput sequencing also indicated that the toxicity of Cd yellow pigment was related to the microbial activity. Summary, the insoluble Cd yellow pigment can increase the risk of Cd uptake in rice. In future, it is possible to investigate in situ the stability of remediation treatments and remobilization of Cd yellow pigment with the extension of the time in rice rhizosphere.

The application of foliage dressing with mineral elements to alleviate Cd toxicity and reduce Cd uptake in rice might offer a cost-effective and practical strategy for safe food production. In the present study, a pot experiment was conducted to select the optimum foliar composition and dosage. Field experiments in two consecutive rice seasons were carried out to investigate the effectiveness and mechanisms of foliage dressing. Foliar spray of S, P, and a mixture of both were effective treatments to reduce Cd concentration in rice grain. The S and P sprays had the ability to change Cd translocation from roots to aboveground parts and change the bioconcentration factor of aboveground parts. The maximum leaf–grain translocation factor decrease rate was 84%, and a maximum bio-concentration factor decrease rate of 69% was observed in the stem. Foliar dressing reduced the adverse effect of Cd and enhanced plant height, yield, photosynthesis, and physiological characteristics. Multiple stepwise regression further highlighted the significant role of leaf Cd, peroxidase, catalase, glutathione, and photosynthesis in determining grain Cd. Foliar spray with S is likely to reduce Cd accumulation in rice grain via minimizing reactive oxygen species production by improving activities of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant defense systems and manipulating glutathione synthesis. The detoxification of foliar-applied P was mainly due to decreased Cd translocation and maintaining photosynthetic machinery. These results indicate that foliage dressing with mineral elements has great potential for the remediation of vast agricultural fields.

Wang and F.-J. Zhao College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, China 2017203047@njau.edu.cn Contamination of cadmium (Cd) in paddy soil is a serious environmental problem threatening food safety in some parts of southern China, where rice grain Cd concentration often exceeds the Chinese limit (0.2 mg kg-1). Many field studies have shown a poor relationship between rice grain Cd concentration and soil total Cd concentration and other soil properties. One of the reasons is that the bioavailability of Cd in paddy soil is strongly influenced by the soil redox potential, especially during the grain filling stage. To investigate this effect, we conducted field experiments in a paddy field contaminated with a moderate level of Cd (total soil Cd 2.6 mg kg-1, pH 5.8) in Xiangtan, Hunan province in 2017 and 2018. The paddy soil surface was prepared in a slight slope (5 cm) along the 20 m length from the irrigation inlet to the outlet. This slope created a gradient of soil water content and hence, the redox potential, when paddy water was drained during the grain filling period. Soil Eh, pH, and dissolved Cd concentration were monitored during the rice growing season. During the grain filling stage when paddy water was drained from the outlet, soil Eh ranged from -200 to -100 mV in the outlet area to 100 – 200 in the inlet area, whilst soil pH varied from 6.2 to 6.7. At maturity, grain Cd concentration showed a distinct spatial pattern, increasing from low levels in the outlet area to high levels in the inlet area, with a difference of 5 fold. To test if the gradient in soil Cd bioavailability generated from differential redox potential along the slope was caused by the drainage-induced variation in soil pH, we applied lime (4.5 t ha-1 CaCO3) to one of the two adjacent field slopes. Liming increased soil pH the initial 5.8 to 6.5. In the unlimed control, rice grain Cd concentration showed the same gradient of 6-fold variation. In contrast, grain Cd concentrations in the limed slope were generally very low and showed no clear spatial pattern. Our results show that variation in the paddy water status during the grain filling can cause a large variation in grain Cd concentration, and this effect is attributed mainly to soil pH changes associated with the variation in the redox potential. To decrease grain Cd concentration, paddy field should be maintained flooded as late as possible during grain filling or that paddy soil should be limed to pH above 6.5.

In the coastal environment, the saltwater inundation and ebb tide can induce anaerobic conditions in soils. However, the effect of anaerobic microbe on As reduction and mobility in coastal wetland with high sulfate has not been reported, and the underlying mechanisms of this process remain poorly understood. This study investigated speciation transformation and redistribution of As in coastal wetland soil under anaerobic conditions using incubation experiments and molecular biology techniques. The effect of microbial sulfidogenesis on these processes was examined by addition of sulfate to the incubation systems. The biotic incubation results clearly revealed that As was reduced to As(III) and released in the early stage of the incubation. Dissolved As(III) and total As concentrations all increased and reached the maximum values of 12.0 and 64.8 μg/L, respectively, either sulfate addition or not. In contrast, As(V) reduction was not observed, and total As concentration was lower in abiotic experiments. In the later stage of the incubation, dissloved As(III) and total As concentrations decreased and resequestered into the solid phase. The XRD and soil sequential extraction analysis indicated that the new mineral of Fe2O3 was formed, and the dissolved As in the solid was re-adsorbed on new formed Fe2O3 mineral primarily in the later stage of the incubation. Moreover, the relative abundances of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were examined.

One main reason for the high accumulation of As in rice grain is the high bioavailability of As in porewater of flooded paddy soil. Recently, it has been shown that the application of soil microbial fuel cell (sMFC) can significantly reduce soil porewater As concentration, however, the effect of sMFC on As accumulation in rice is unknown. In this study, a pot experiment was performed to investigate As distribution in rice tissues and the functional microbial communities in soil when the sMFC was installed. The results suggest that the sMFC can simultaneously work as an electricity generator and As mitigator. The total As concentrations in the stems, leaves, husks, and rice grains were significantly decreased by 53.4%, 44.7%, 62.6%, and 67.9%, respectively in the plants with sMFC compared to the control. This decrease in As accumulation in the sMFC treatment may be explained by the decrease in the As reducing arrC gene abundance and soil porewater dissolve organic matter content. The sMFC also significantly increased the relative abundance of the As oxidizing aioA and the As methylation arsM genes which also may have favored the decrease in porewater As. Therefore, the sMFC offers a promising way to mitigate As accumulation in rice tissue and reduce dietary As exposure, while simultaneously producing electricity.

Daily consumption of Cd contaminated rice has caused Itai-Itai disease in Japan. Cd in rice was found as high as 1–2 mg kg−1 in some areas in China and is much higher than the national standard 0.2 mg kg−1 (GB2762-2005), imposing great threat to both food security and safety. Therefore, reducing Cd accumulation in rice grains is highly demanded. Previous QTL analysis identified OsHMA3 and CAL1 as two important players in Cd translocation between roots and shoots. OsHMA3 regulates cadmium translocation via the modulation of vacuolar sequestration capacity for Cd in rice roots. CAL1 encodes a defensin-like protein, which facilitates Cd loading into xylem vessels by chelation and the subsequent secretion from cytosol to apoplastic compartments. Here we reported the mapping and isolation of another major QTL SQ9, using the previously reported parental varieties CJ06 and TN01 as the derived mapping population. SQ9 is located on Chromosome 2 and contributes about 20% of the overall variance in Cd accumulation in rice grains. Pilot experiments showed that overexpression of the SQ9TN1 increased Cd concentration in grains with CJ06 background, while reduced Cd concentrations in grains was observed in the knock-out mutants of SQ9 in TN1 background. We will further report and discuss the underlying mechanisms.

Meanwhile, the application of potassium (K) fertilizers has a broad influence on the transportation and accumulation of Cd in soil-crop system. Therefore, a greenhouse pot experiment was conducted with in-situ Cd-contaminated soil to study the influence of different forms of K fertilizers (KCl, K2SO4, and KNO3) on Cd accumulation in rice, wheat, and pakchoi as well as Cd fractions in soils. The results showed the Cd contents in all crops increased in the KCl treatments; it increased by 10.84%-172.77%, 17.09%-67.72%, 15.27%-41.22% in rice grains, wheat grains, and pakchoi shoots, respectively, when KCl dose increased from the lowest to the highest. Generally, in the K2SO4 treatment, the Cd contents in rice decreased greatly while those in wheat and pakchoi increased slightly. The supply of KNO3 also led to an increase in the Cd contents in crops. In addition, KCl resulted in a significant increase in the NH4NO3 extractable Cd (NEX-Cd) content in paddy soil. However, there were no significant differences in NEX-Cd content between all the treatments in wheat soil or pakchoi soil no matter which forms or doses of K fertilizers were applied. Consequently, when K fertilizers are applied to in-situ Cd-contaminated soils, both forms and doses should be fully considered to mitigate the Cd accumulation in crops, especially the edible part. Hopefully, our manuscript can offer opinions to understand underlying mechanisms of Cd transportation in soil-crop system when soil was disturbed by potassium fertilizers.

Reducing arsenic accumulation in rice grain is of critical importance for food safety. In our work, we investigated the role of a member of the rice C-type ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (OsABCC) family, OsABCC7, in arsenite [As(III)] accumulation in rice. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR showed that OsABCC7 was expressed intensively in the roots and the expression was strongly suppressed by As(III) exposure. Transgenic rice plants expressing OsABCC7 Pro-GUS showed that the gene was predominantly expressed in the xylem parenchyma cells in the stele region of the primary and lateral roots. Transient expression of OsABCC7:GFP fusion protein in Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells showed that the protein was localized at the plasma membrane. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, OsABCC7 showed an efflux activity for As(III)-glutathione complex but not for As(III). Knockout of OsABCC7 in rice significantly decreased As(III) concentration in the xylem sap and As concentration in the shoots, but had little effect on root As concentration. Taken together, our results indicate that OsABCC7 is involved in the root-to-shoot translocation of As(III).

The results indicated that dissolved Cd, Pb and Zn were microbially removed from solutions, which was likely due to the formation of metal sulfides after reduction of natural sulfate by indigenous sulfate-reducing bacteria. The soil containing a large amount of sulfate resulted in complete removal of dissolved As after 25 days, while there were gradual increases in dissolved As concentration in the soils which showed low sulfate concentrations. Subsequent experiments with sulfate supply were conducted to identify the effects of sulfate amendment to stimulate microbial sulfate reduction on heavy metal behaviors. Batch-type experiments were performed with lactate or glucose as a carbon source to activate indigenous bacteria under anaerobic condition for 100 days. Sulfate (250 mg/L) was artificially injected at 60 days after the onset of the experiments. Lactate supply exerted no significant difference on the amounts of dissolved Zn, Pb, Ni and Cu between microbial and abiotic control slurries; however, lower Zn, Pb and Ni and higher Cu concentrations were observed in the microbial slurries than in the controls when glucose supplied. Sulfate amendment led to dramatic decrease in dissolved Cr and maintenance of dissolved As, both of which had gradually increased over time till the sulfate injection. Black precipitates formed in solution after sulfate amendment, and violarite was found via XRD analysis in the microbial precipitates. Conceivably the mineral might be formed after Fe(III) reduction and microbial sulfate reduction with coprecipitation of heavy metals.

In many East and South Asian countries, the accumulation of arsenic (As) in rice ecosystems and its subsequent transfer to the human food chain is a major environmental issue. Codex Committee of Contaminants in Food (CCCF) has set a new standard of arsenic (As) in rice in 2014 and discussing a code of practice for the prevention and reduction of As contamination in rice since 2013. In order to establish a propose draft maximum level for As in rice, inorganic and total As content in both brown and polished rice produced were monitored in Korea. The average concentration of inorganic and total As in polished rice monitored were 0.07 and 0.11 mg/kg, respectively. The average concentration of inorganic and total As in brown rice monitored were 0.11 and 0.18 mg/kg, respectively. In this study, the As in rice was not closely related to the As in paddy soil taken from the same sites. This study were also conducted to investigate the effect of water management and soil amendments on As accumulation in rice, and to select the low As accumulation rice genotypes which are resistant to As uptake. The reduction efficiency of the amendment was confirmed to be higher efficiency in As reduction for brown rice by the order of gypsum > steel slag > poultry manure > agri-lime. We also concluded that limited water supply may be a promising strategy to reduce As accumulation in rice grains. 280 rice cultivars were screened to find the lower As accumulated rice cultivars in Korea. It concluded that the screening program is feasible to effectively reduce the risk of human exposure. However, additional field studies and As bioaccessibility research are required to control As in paddy soils and rice grains.

Ma Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Japan wpt361@gmail.com Arsenic (As), a class 1 carcinogen is widely distributed in the environment. Since rice (Oryza sativa) takes up As in the form of arsenite (As(III)) in paddy field through highly expressed Si transporters Lsi1 and Lsi2, it is able to accumulate higher As in the grains compared with other cereal crops. As a result, rice is a major dietary source of inorganic As for the populations consuming rice as the staple food. Therefore, it is a very important issue for human health to reduce the As accumulation in rice grains. To identify genes controlling As accumulation in rice, we first investigated the genotypic difference in shoot As accumulation in 134 core collection rice varieties. By using hydroponic solution containing 1 µM As(III), we found that shoot As concentration ranged from 11 to 41 mg kg-1 dry weight depending on cultivars after exposure for 6 days. Furthermore, indica cultivars accumulated significantly lower As in the shoots than japonica cultivars. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we used one F2 population and one chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL) population to map the responsible genes. The F2 population was derived from a cross between an indica cultivar (lower As concentration) and an japonica cultivar (higher As concentration). By using the F2 population, one major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for shoot As accumulation was detected on chromosome 10. This QTL explained 20-30% of total As variation. A QTL located at the same region was also detected by using the CSSL population derived from Muha (indica cultivar, low As) and Koshihikari (japonica cultivar, high As). In addition, another QTL on chromosome 6 was also mapped for shoot As concentration in this CSSL population. Fine mapping of these QTL genes is being undertaken by using high generation populations in future.

Cost saving and high efficient remediation strategies for controlling rice Cd content are urgently needed. The effects of three water management modes i.e. drought (D), intermittent flooding (IF), continuous flooding (CF) and the combined application of water management and amendments iron silicon rich materials (IS) and biochar (B) on Cd uptake of different rice varieties were studied by field experiment, and the possible mechanisms of their effects were discussed. The results showed that the content of brown rice Cd under CF condition from tillering to maturity stage was reduced by 0.2%-45.43% and by 37.67-62.11%, respectively, compared with IF and D treatments. Under three water management modes, the content of brown rice Cd of low accumulative rice cultivar G82168 was 35.03%-54.61% lower than that of conventional variety. Under the condition of three modes of water (D.IF, CF) management, the content of Cd in brown rice treated with IS amendment decreased by 64.26%, 55.74% and 38.14% compared with that treated with water management only, and the effect of combined amendment IS+B was much weaker. Brown rice Cd was the lowest with the combined application of low cumulative variety, continuous flooding and IS. Continuous flooding could promote the fixation of Cd by root iron plaque which acted as a barrier for Cd entering rice plant. On the other hand, continuous flooding also significantly decreased soil available Cd (extracted by 0.01M CaCl2) by 29.71%-63.13%. Both the mechanisms helped to reduce the Cd uptake by rice. IS had no significant effect on the root iron plaque fixed Cd. It decreased rice Cd uptake mainly by decreasing the content of soil available Cd dramatically. The combined application of low accumulative rice variety, continuous flooding and IS can guarantee the safety of rice production on Cd contaminated paddy soil. Planting low accumulative rice cultivars coupled with continuous flooding during the critical growth stage are of great significance to inhibit Cd uptake by rice. Application of amendments and low accumulative rice varieties should be emphasized in water shortage seasons or areas.

However, across Asia, cadmium (Cd) has increasingly accumulated in paddy soil owing to the use of phosphate fertilizers and the release of industrial effluents into irrigation channels that are used for flooding paddy fields. The food safety risk posed by increasing Cd levels in rice is of great concern. Information about the genotypic variations of Cd tolerance, distribution, and accumulation in rice plants is essential for selecting and breeding more rice cultivars to reduce Cd in human diets. Rice cultivars showing low Cd transportation into the aboveground parts of a plant can be selected to reduce Cd contamination in grains. In this study, eight rice cultivars, TY3, TK9, TNG71, KH145, TKW1, TKW3, TCS10, and TCS17, which are commonly grown in Taiwan, were used. The seedlings of each cultivar were transplanted with 0, 5, 10, 50, 100, and 250 µM CdCl2 solutions, respectively, for a 7-day treatment in hydroponics. The Cd-treatment resulted in significant reductions in the root elongation and the shoot extension of rice seedlings for each cultivar. According to the Cd distributions in the root and shoot for the used cultivars, the Cd absorption by rice plants was predominantly accumulated in the root rather than transferred to the shoot. The Cd-treatment induced lignification in the sclerenchyma tissue and in the endodermis and metaxylem cell walls of the rice root specimens. The lignification of the cell walls enhancing the Cd sequestration by the root would be related to the tolerance to Cd toxicity and to the Cd transfer into the aboveground parts of a rice plant. Much higher Cd concentrations in the shoot were found for the TY3 and TK9 plants. By contrast, the translocations of Cd in TNG71, KH145, TKW1, and TKW3 plants were relatively low. Thus TNG71, KH145, TKW1, and TKW3 would be the candidates for cultivation to reduce Cd transported into the aboveground parts of a rice plant. TCS10 and TCS17 cultivars also showed low translocation of Cd from the root into the shoot, but their Cd absorption rates in the plant were much higher than the other cultivars.

Japanese arable lands, especially paddy fields, are contaminated to some extent by Cd through irrigation with river water originating from mines or through emission from metal-smelters. Rice is a staple crop in Japan and is a major source for dietary intake of Cd. In addition, soybean or wheat is often used as a rotation crop or a secondary crop, respectively, in paddy fields; therefore Cd concentrations of soybean and wheat should also be taken care of as well as rice. The rice Nramp5 is well known to mediate Cd and manganese (Mn) uptake in the root and the knockout line greatly reduces Cd concentration in the grains. In a recent study, the Cd transport activity in TaNramp5A and 5D from hexaploid wheat was investigated. In this study, we examined if the Nramp5 orthologs in soybean and two types of wheat, i.e., tetraploid and hexaploid wheat, have ability for Cd and Mn transport. To examine the effects of Cd on Mn uptake in the plants, the seedlings of rice, soybean, and wheat were treated for 3 days with different levels of Cd (0, 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5, 1 mg Cd/L) in nutrient solution and the Cd and Mn concentrations of plants were determined by ICP-MS or ICP-OES after acid-digestion. The full-length ORF of Nramp5 in rice (OsNramp5), soybean (GmNramp5), tetraploid wheat (TdNramp5A and TdNramp5B), and hexaploid wheat (TaNramp5A, TaNramp5B, and TaNramp5D) was cloned by PCR and sequenced. For subcellular localization analysis, confocal microscopy of rice protoplasts transiently producing the Nramp5 orthologs fused with green fluorescence protein (GFP) was performed. The two yeast mutants, Cd-sensitive Δycf1 and Mn uptake-defective Δsmf1, were used to analyze Cd and Mn transport activities of Nramp5 orthologs. Metal analysis showed that the Cd concentrations of shoots and roots in all plant species were increased in dose-depending manner, but the Mn concentrations remarkably decreased with increasing Cd levels, indicating antagonistic interaction between Cd and Mn uptake by roots in plant species tested. The cDNA sequences between TdNramp5B and TaNramp5B matched perfectively. High identity of more than 80% was found between rice and wheat in amino acid sequence of Nramp5. Amino acid sequence of OsNramp5 and GmNramp5 shared 69% identity. Confocal microscopy of rice protoplasts expressing GFP-fused proteins demonstrated that the all Nramp5 orthologs are localized at the plasma membrane. The growth of Δycf1 cells expressing OsNramp5 or GmNramp5 was strongly impaired by Cd, whereas all Nramp5 homologs in wheat did not affect the growth. The growth of Δsmf1 was improved by the expression of OsNramp5 or GmNramp5, whereas was not by all Nramp5 homologs in wheat. These results suggest high or low ability for Cd and Mn transport through GmNramp5 or Nramp5 homologs in wheat, respectively.

Therefore, it is necessary to develop a rice cultivar with low Cd uptake. We previously found rice mutants showing low Cd uptake from a rice mutant library developed by carbon ion beam irradiation method. Previous results indicated that the defective OsNramp5 transporter greatly reduces Cd concentration in rice grains. However, because OsNramp5 is a major transporter for manganese (Mn), Mn concentration in mutants was decreased as well. On the other hand, iron (Fe) concentration in straw of the mutant was 1.5 - 2 times higher than that of the original rice cultivar (WT) when they were cultivated under continuously submerged conditions, while the Fe concentration of grains in the mutant was not significantly increased. To investigate the molecular mechanisms on the increased Fe level in straws for rice mutants with defective OsNramp5, we performed a microarray analysis using root samples of rice seedlings grown in hydroponic culture. The analysis showed that expression levels of several genes involving in Fe transport were significantly upregulated in the mutant compared to the WT. Because the transcript levels of OsIRO2, OsNAS1, OsNAS2, OsYSL15 and OsTOM2 were increased in the mutant, it was speculated that Strategy II mechanisms of chelation-based Fe uptake were activated. Thus, OsNramp5 mutation enhanced the expression levels of genes involved in Fe transport independent of Fe deficiency. According to the study by Inoue et al. (2009), OsYSL15 gene expression is not induced by Mn deficiency. Thus, we guess that such enhanced gene expression could not be due to the reduced Mn uptake in OsNramp5 defective mutants. Further investigation would be needed to elucidate the mechanisms on the changes in Fe transport metabolism in the OsNrmap5 defective rice mutant.

Paddy fields are characterized with periodic flooding and drainage, which have a substantial impact upon the solubility of Cd in soils. The elevated Cd concentrations in rice grains are mainly attributed to the enhanced mobilization of Cd during pre-harvest drainage, with this period coinciding with grain filling stage. There are substantial variations among the soils in the release rates of Cd once soils are drained, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we used sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) to synthesize Cd and Zn sulfides with different Zn/Cd ratios (0-600 on a molar basis). Using a microcosm incubation system simulating the occurrence of typical flooded/drained processes, we added these synthetic sulfides into the flooded soils to investigate the release of Cd in the subsequent oxidation process. Our results show that a higher Zn/Cd ratio leads to a lower Cd release during the oxidation phase under different pH conditions. When the Zn/Cd ratio is higher than 200, little of Cd is released. These results indicate an important role of the ratio of Zn/Cd in sulfides formed in the reducing soil in the subsequent release of Cd during soil drainage. Enhancing the ratio of Zn/Cd in the sulfides may provide a strategy to mitigate Cd accumulation in rice grains.

In recent research, it has been reported that the extents of As accumulated in plants related to the plant species, soil characteristics and climate. Compared with paddy rice, the mechanism of the As uptake by upland crop is still unclear. In general, vegetables are grown in upland field which availablility of As in soil is low, so it is not easy to accumulate As in plants. However, due to water spinach can be planted in both flooding and upland field, which may cause the differences in As accumulation in plants between these two water managements. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to compare the distribution of As species and total As concentration in water spinach grown in As-contaminated soils with different water managements (flooding and upland conditions). In this study, two tested soils collected from Guandu(Gd) and Minsyong(Ms), which soil texture are clay and silt loam, respectively. The As concentration in Gd soils are 21 mg As kg−1(GdL) and 139 mg As kg−1(GdH), and those in Ms soils are 38 mg As kg−1(MsL) and 100 mg As kg−1(MsH). Besides, the contents of organic matter and free iron (Fe) oxide (DCB extractable) in Gd soils are higher than in Ms soils. The results showed that the arsenite (iAslll) was the dominant species in the soil pore water under two water managements, while the proportion of arsenate (iAsV) in the upland field was slightly increased. Due to the higher contents of free Fe oxides in Gd soils, the amounts of Fe plaque on the root surface and biomass of the water spinach grown in Gd soils are higher than Ms soils. The results of plant analysis showed that the As concentration in plants grown in GdH soil was higher than other tested soils, and it also indicated the As concentrations in roots were higher than shoots. Inorganic As was the predominant species in water spinach, while the main As species in roots is iAslll, and the aboveground part is iAsV. In addition, it was found that the proportion of iAsV in plants grown in soil with upland condition was higher than flooding condition. Based on the results of this study, it suggests the As species in water spinach is highly related to those in soil pore water, and the As accumulation in edible parts are significantly decreased under upland condition.

To find the cause of these discrepancy, the objectives of the present study were (1) to compare As solubility in flooded soils amended with different types of OAMs, and (2) to clarify the important factor to determine As solubility in soils amended with OAMs. A surface paddy soil was collected and passed through a 2-mm mesh sieve. The soil had 7.42 mg kg-1 of HCl-extractable As. We used 15 OAMs from three different sources, namely (1) plant-based composts (PBCs), (2) cattle manures (CMs), and (3) fermented livestock (swine and poultry) droppings (FLDs). They were milled mechanically and were sieved through 1-mm mesh sieves with keeping moisture in them. Their carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N) ranged from 5.1 to 45.7, and the average of C/N of each source of OAM decreased in the order of PBCs>CMs>FLDs. Moist soil (10 g as oven-dried basis) and OAM (0.05 g as oven-dried basis) were mixed with ultra-pure water to bring the total water up to 30 mL in a glass vial. Corresponding vials without OAM (control soils) were also prepared. Vials were tightly capped after N2 gas purging, then were manually shaken well. They were incubated at 30 °C for a specific period with shaking every 2 or 3 days. After incubation, the soil solution was collected and immediately acidified. The acidified soil solution was diluted and used for As measurement by ICP-MS. Residual soil suspension was used for measuring pH and Eh. After incubation, all soils with FLD contained significantly greater dissolved As than those with control soils at 10 and 39 days after incubation. The dissolved As in soils with two CMs were also significantly greater than control soils at day 39, while the rest of the OAMs did not promote As solubilization. The amounts of dissolved As in all soils eventually became comparable at 80 days. Averaged relative ratio of dissolved As in soils with FLBs to control soils was significantly greater than those with the PBCs and CMs at days 10 and 39 (P "},"S4/90-Juang-K-S4.docx.html":{"url":"S4/90-Juang-K-S4.docx.html","title":"Kai-Wei Juang (Poster)","keywords":"","body":"Evaluation of genotypic variation in Cd toxicity and distribution for rice seedlings with regarding physiological regulations Kai-Wei Juanga and W.-T. Chiaob a Department of Agronomy, National Chiayi University, Chiayi City, Taiwan, China b Ph.D. Program of Agriculture Science, National Chiayi University, Chiayi City, Taiwan, China kwjuang@mail.ncyu.edu.tw Paddy rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a staple crop in most East and Southeast Asian countries. However, across Asia, cadmium (Cd) has increasingly accumulated in paddy soil owing to the use of phosphate fertilizers and the release of industrial effluents into irrigation channels that are used for flooding paddy fields. The food safety risk posed by increasing Cd levels in rice is of great concern. Information about the genotypic variations of Cd tolerance, distribution, and accumulation in rice plants is essential for selecting and breeding more rice cultivars to reduce Cd in human diets. At present, variations in the Cd levels in rice plants and accumulation in rice grains are still not considered during rice breeding in Taiwan. A physiological understanding of genotypic variations in Cd contents in rice grains would be useful for better selecting or breeding low Cd-accumulation rice genotypes. The present study aims to investigate Cd absorption and toxicity in different rice cultivars and to clarify their relationship with the physiological response to Cd stress. This study conducted a hydroponic experiment to investigate rice genotypic variations in Cd absorption and toxicity related to plant physiological traits. Eight paddy rice cultivars were selected based on the criteria of rice grains quality in Taiwan. These rice cultivars were of three different types: japonica (TY3, TK9, TNG71, and KH145 cultivars), indica (TCS10 and TCS17 cultivars), and glutinous (TKW1 and TKW3 cultivars). Uniformly grown seedlings were drawn up for Cd treatment with 50 µM CdCl2 in hydroponics for 7 days; a check was set at 0 µM CdCl2. In results, the reductions of shoot growth were more significant than those of root growth for the rice cultivars with Cd treatment. However, absorbed Cd was preferentially accumulated in the root than in the shoot. This suggested that less Cd transfer from the root to the shoot would be related to higher Cd tolerance and shoot growth improvement. The oxidative statuses of rice plant under Cd stress depended on the configurations of H2O2 in the root and shoot and the oxidative damages of Cd stress were determined by the malondialdehyde (MDA) contents in plant. The results showed more enhanced MDA by Cd treatment in the root than in the shoot. This consisted with that the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activities were more pronounced in the shoot than in the root. The regulation tendencies of SOD and APX were also related to the Cd preferential accumulation in the root. Therefore, the root would play a role in protecting the shoot from oxidative damages of Cd stress for rice plants.

Zhaoa a College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, China. b Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Japan. changjiadong1991@163.com Cadmium (Cd) is nonessential and toxic for rice growth and humans. Rice is a major dietary source of Cd for Asian populations. Reducing Cd accumulation in rice grains is an important task. A number of transporters involved in the uptake or translocation of Cd have been identified in rice. Previous studies have shown that OsNRAMP5 is constitutively expressed in the roots and encodes a plasma membrane-localized protein. OsNRAMP5 is polarly localized at the distal side of both exodermis and endodermis cells. Knockout of OsNRAMP5 resulted in a significant reduction of Cd accumulation in rice roots and shoots. The aim of this study is to manipulate both the expression and tissue localization of OsNRAMP5 under the control of the rice OsActin1 promoter. We generated transgenic rice overexpressing OsNRAMP5, and tested the effect on Cd uptake and translocation. Overexpression of OsNRAMP5 in rice promoted Cd uptake into the roots but decreased Cd translocation from the roots to the shoots, and decreased Cd concentration in the shoots markedly. However, overexpression lines had no significant effect on manganese concentration of shoots, but increased Mn concentration of roots in hydroponic experiments when exposed to different Mn concentrations. A short-term Cd uptake experiment revealed that the Km of overexpressing lines was more than two times higher than wild-type. Immunostaining showed that the overexpressed OsNRAMP5 proteins were localized in all cells of root tips and lateral root primordium without polarity. Cd imaging indicated the overexpression lines accumulated higher Cd concentration in the root tips by using synchrotron X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM). In addition, overexpressing lines showed much stronger intensity of Cd green fluorescens in the epithelial cells and vascular bundle of mature roots compared with the wild-type, in agreement with the results of the Cd concentration. When grown in two Cd-contaminated paddy soils, overexpression lines contained significantly lower Cd concentration in rice grains than the wild-type without disturbing accumulation of essential nutrients. Overexpression of OsNRAMP5 contributed to flux of Cd from the stele, restricting xylem loading of Cd consequently. Taken together, our study has shown that overexpression of OsNRAMP5 can reduce Cd accumulation in rice grains effectively.

In contrast to oxic soil environments, mobility and bioavailability of As to rice under (reduced) paddy soil conditions is an emerging issue to food security and human health. This is because rice is a staple food of about 3 billion people throughout the world including in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh and it accumulates As in paddy soil environments. The objectives of the present study were to: (1) explore the accumulation of As in different parts of rice (Oryza sativa L.) plants of the two contrasting rice genotypes (Kainat and KSK-385), and (2) evaluate the effect of As on morphological and biochemical parameters of rice plants. Six types of organic (farm yard manure (FYM), cow dung (CD), biogas slurry (BGS), mixed biomaterials waste (MBW)) and inorganic (gypsum, lignite) amendments were applied to determine their impact on soil As availability and uptake by the two rice genotypes. Arsenic-contaminated irrigation water was applied to rice plants after 15 days of transplantation in three intervals – each irrigation contained 15 mg As/L (400 mL per 2 kg soil). We found that the percentage increase in number of tillers ranged from 28–51% and tiller length spanned 28–50% with the maximum values obtained for FYM over their respective control for KSK-385 genotype. In the case of Kainat genotype, number of tillers and tiller length ranged from 41–50% and 18–33%, respectively, with the maximum values attained for CD treatment compared to control. This study highlights that organic amendments, notably FYM and CD, could possibly have nutritional effect, although contrasting, on the growth of two rice genotypes under As stress, thus providing an essential strategy to mitigate As accumulation in rice under paddy soil conditions. Our further analysis of As in rice tissue and in different soil fractions will help identify As bioavailability and transfer in paddy-soil rice system.

The world’s first documented incidence of mass poisoning by Cd, the Itai-Itai disease in Japan, brought global public attention to the problem of Cd-contaminated rice. For this reason, bioaccumulation of Cd in rice grain is a major agricultural concern, particularly in Asian countries where people ingest rice two to three times per day. Many agricultural soils are contaminated with Cd due to anthropogenic inputs such as smelting, fossil fuel burning, and application of sewage sludge and phosphate fertilizer. Traditional remediation technologies that focus on soil washing or excavation and transport of farmed soils to prescribed landfills is not practicable with the management of agricultural soils exposed to Cd. For this reason, a risk based approach, that minimizes Cd uptake by plants in upland soils is often practiced in most countries. In this study, we have investigated the potential role of iron plaque formation in paddy soils on soil solution Cd dynamics and uptake by rice plant. Two soils (pH values 4.6 and 6.6) collected from the rice growing region (Griffith) of Australia were chosen for this study. Rice was grown as per traditional practice such as under continuous flooding conditions. Two Australian local rice cultivars (Quest and Langi) were used. Three levels of Cd (0, 1 and 3 mg Cd kg-1 soil) and three levels of Fe (0, 50 and 100 mg Fe kg-1 soil) were spiked in soil. The experiments were carried out in the pot under glasshouse conditions with three replication. Rhizon sampler were installed in the pot before the rice transplanted and soil pore water were collected with Rhizon sampler at different growth stages of rice plant (10, 30, 60, and 110 days of transplanting). The samples were analyzed for Fe and Cd using ICP-OES and ICP-MS, respectively. The results showed that Cd concentration in soil pore water gradually decreased with growing period of paddy rice. Comparison among the data of four time points (Day 10, 30, 60 and 110) demonstrated that pore water Cd concentration was the highest at the initial sampling period (day 10) and reached to the lowest values at day The Cd concentration in pore water increased greatly with application of Fe @50mg/L and this trend of increment was declined at higher dose of Fe (100mg/L) application. Further investigations with increasing concentrations of Cd and Fe are required to determine the effect of Fe to reduce the Cd level in rice grain.

In many cases, modifications of the cell walls and intercellular spaces (apoplasm), especially those in the root peripheral parts (epidermis, cortex), are the key stage in defence responses. Along the whole plant body there are several checkpoints that regulate water transport and the movement of solutes, including toxic metals, metalloids and (potentially toxic) nutrients. Checkpoints are known at the root surface, starting from the protection of the root apical meristem by the root cap and the interface between the rhizodermis/root hairs and the soil. Radial transport across the root is regulated at the exodermis and endodermis. Suberin, lignin and other cell wall components occurring in peripheral parts of a root form barriers preventing uncontrolled movement of solutes, water and gasses. A further checkpoint is in the transfer from the symplasmic space to the xylem apoplasmic space. Xylem transport along the plant body is regulated by checkpoints between lateral roots and the main root, and in junctions between the root and the stem. Leaf interconnections with the stem in nodes is another checkpoint in transport processes. The sporophyte/gametophyte junction and the connection between maternal tissues and the embryo are the final, and very important, checkpoints in transport processes.

Especially, developing tissues such as meristem require high Zn for their active growth. In my talk, I will introduce transporters involved in uptake, root-to-shoot translocation and distribution of Zn in rice. OsZIP9, a member of ZIP family is mainly expressed at the exodermis of the roots. Its expression was up-regulated by Zn-deficiency. Knockdown of this gene resulted in decreased Zn uptake and growth. Therefore, OsZIP9 is a transporter for Zn uptake under Zn-deficient condition. After uptake, part of Zn will be sequestered to the vacuoles by OsHMA3, a member of HMA family. Our recent work showed that OsHMA3 plays an important role in both Zn detoxification and storage in rice roots. The root-to-shoot translocation of Zn is mediated by OsHMA2, a homolog of OsHMA3. OsHMA2 is localized to the plasma membrane of root pericyclic cells. Knockout of this gene resulted in decreased translocation of Zn to the shoots. Distribution of Zn to different organs of above-ground part is mediated by at least two transporters, OsZIP3 and OsHMA2. Both OsZIP3 and OsHMA2 are highly expressed in the nodes, a hub for mineral element distribution in rice. OsZIP3 is localized in the xylem intervening parenchyma cells and xylem transfer cells of enlarged vascular bundles (EVBs), while OsHMA2 is localized at phloem region of both EVBs and diffuse vascular bundles (DVBs). Therefore, OsZIP3 is responsible for unloading Zn from the xylem of EVB, while OsHMA2 is responsible for loading Zn to the phloem of DVBs and EVBs. Knockout of either OsHMA2 or OsZIP3 resulted in decreased distribution of Zn to the developing tissues.

We believe that it is now essential to obtain a broader picture of metal hyperaccumulation in plants using recent developments in elemental analysis and sequencing technologies. To identify new hyperaccumulator species, we initiated a screen of plant specimens at the Herbarium of the French National Museum of Natural History using X-ray fluorescence. Our analyses focusing on regions that have been poorly investigated so far, including Central/South America and Madagascar, revealed putative new hyperaccumulator of zinc and manganese. In particular, we identified 22 species from Proteaceae, Phyllanthaceae and Salicaceae families containing more than 10,000 ppm manganese in leaves, thus significantly expending the number of known manganese hyperaccumulators. To identify molecular mechanisms involved in metal hyperaccumulation in plants, we are also developing comparative RNA-Seq based strategies to identify genes whose expression is linked to the metal hyperaccumulation trait in several plant families. Differential gene expression analyses using pairs of hyperaccumulator and closely related non-accumulator species from diverse plant families coupled to annotation of Cluster of Orthologous Groups revealed mechanisms involved in nickel hyperaccumulation shared by different species. These analyses revealed that the high expression of Ferroportin/IREG transporters in leaves is a highly convergent mechanisms involved in nickel tolerance and hyperaccumulation. Accordingly, functional studies using transgenic N. caerulescens support that the NcIREG2 transporter located on the vacuole is implicated in nickel accumulation. A better knowledge of these peculiar species and the underlying mechanisms will become instrumental to develop phytoextraction technologies to limit the impact of development on the environment and recycle valuable metals.

The interface between the soil and a plant, or, the concentration of a particular chemical element in a plant with respect to its concentration in the soil, is the basis for a widely used Biological Absorption Coefficient, also known as the Transfer Factor, Bioaccumulation Factor, Mobility Ratio, or Plant–Soil Coefficient, which are expressed in terms of the chemical element’s concentration in the plant and soil. However, from the biogeochemical perspective, these coefficients/factors can provide a comparison of the chemical element (CE) concentration in different media (plants and soil), but only in a particular place (under typical environmental conditions) and at a particular time. Therefore, a quantitative method, using the dynamic factors of bioaccumulation, biophilicity, translocation, bioavailability and phytoremediation , is offered to assess the variation in the process of the uptake of chemical elements by different plants, to evaluate the influence of soil modification on their participation in the plants’ metabolism and to perform quantitative evaluation of phytoremediation efficiency over a particular period of time. Dynamic factors help to identify and demonstrate more than only the primary causes (e.g. the total CEs concentration in the substrate) for intensive CEs transfer to a plant. For this purpose, the relationship between the CE concentrations in the morphological part of a plant and CE concentration in the substrate is used. It allows the available biogeochemical data on biophilic CEs and the barrier and non-barrier plants to be used in the evaluation. The dynamic bioavailability, bioaccumulation and translocation factors also show that physical and chemical changes in soil can cause physiological variation in biogeochemical migration of substances in a plant. Determining the transfer intensity based on using the dynamic factors of bioaccumulation and biophilicity, it has been found that the biotic and abiotic factors, influence plants and can be characterized by a similar bioaccumulation level of CEs. This helps to evaluate the scope of activity and importance of these factors. The calculation of the bioaccumulation factors in the process of evaluating the extent of contamination and the effect of CEs helps to more accurately define the affected zone of an ecosystem and to determine the role of plants as the primary geochemical (biogeochemical) barriers to aerogenic CE transfer. Thus, the use of the dynamic factor method for assessing the quality of the environment is effective in evaluating environmental risks, biogeochemical CE migration, the environmental effect of CEs migration and the efficiency of phytotechnologies.

Jun.Li@UGent.be Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for humans and animals with a narrow window between deficiency and toxicity levels. Application of conventional chemical Se fertilizers to increase the Se content in crops could result in secondary soil and water contamination due to the low utilization rate of Se. Therefore, it may be beneficial to produce slow-release Se-enriched organic fertilizers locally from Se-containing (waste)water. This may contribute to the worldwide drive for resource recovery and circular economy. In this study, we aim to evaluate the bioavailability of Se released from two Se-enriched biomaterials (duckweed and anaerobic sludge) in soil, and to assess the potential of these two biomaterials as Se fertilizers. Green beans were grown on sandy and loamy soils fertilized with Se-enriched duckweed and anaerobic sludge at rates equivalent to 1 and 5 mg Se/kg soil. Non-planted treatments served as controls. The mobility and solubility of Se were assessed by measuring the Se concentration in the soil pore water and in the different bean tissues. The Se composition in the Se-enriched duckweed and anaerobic sludge was analyzed by HPLC-ICP-MS and EXAFS (Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure), respectively. Results showed that Se was mainly present as the hexavalent selenate form in duckweed and the zerovalent form in anaerobic sludge. The different Se species in the two biomaterials resulted in distinct Se release patterns. After 3 d of incubation, the application of 1 and 5 mg Se/kg soil of duckweed increased the Se concentration in pore water to 537 and 4375 µg/L for sandy soil, and 413 and 1238 µg/L for loamy soil, respectively; whereas the sludge amendment of 1 and 5 mg Se/kg soil led to an increment of Se content in pore water to 65 and 322 µg/L for sandy soil, and 72 and 387 µg/L for loamy soil, respectively. However, increasing the incubation time from 3 to 42 d reduced the Se content in soil pore water by 92% for sandy soil and 89% for loamy soil in non-planted treatments amended with 5 mg Se/kg soil of duckweed. The decrease of bioavailable Se followed a second-order equation. By contrast, the Se concentration in the pore water of soils supplied with sludge remained stable during the entire incubation period. The application of Se-enriched duckweed and anaerobic sludge significantly increased the Se concentration in the different tissues of beans (seeds, leaves, stems, and roots), which was supported by the positive correlation between Se in the soil pore water and Se in the beans tissues. In addition, the Se concentration in beans fertilized with sludge was 1 to 3 times higher than in those amended with duckweed. The seeds of beans produced in this study could contribute to achieving the recommended daily Se intake for human diets. Overall, Se-enriched green beans were successfully produced after amending the soil with Se-enriched duckweed and anaerobic sludge, demonstrating their potential as organic Se-rich fertilizers for Se deficient regions.

Natural Resistance-Associated Macrophage Proteins (NRAMPs) comprise a family that is evolutionarily conserved from bacteria to human beings and acts as proton/metal symporters that are able to transport a broad range of metals, including Fe2+, Mn2+, Zn2+ and Cd2+. NRAMP1 is a root high-affinity transporter for Mn uptake in Arabidopsis. Mutation of NRAMP1 impairs root growth under Mn deficient conditions. To identify additional genes required for Mn uptake and transport, we carried out a forward genetic screen on an EMS-mutagenized population in the nramp1 background in Arabidopsis. Through the screening for mutants that are sensitive to low Mn, we identified a mutant showing Mn-dependent short root growth. Gene cloning led to the identification of the responsible gene NRAMP2 that could complement the defective root growth in the mutant under Mn deficiency. Our results reveal that under Mn deficient conditions, increased accumulation of H2O2 is partially responsible for the root growth inhibition and that NRAMP2 is a Mn transporter localized in the trans-Golgi network and is involved in remobilization of Mn in Golgi for root growth. Overexpression of NRAMP2 improved plant growth at Mn-deficient conditions. Besides NRAMP1 and NRAMP2, we found that NRAMP6 is also required for sustaining root growth at low Mn conditions. Although NRAMP6 was expressed in roots at a low level, NRAMP6 plays an unequal redundant role with NRAMP1 to be involved in the regulation of root growth and Mn translocation from roots to shoots under Mn deficient conditions. Overexpression of NRAMP6 improves root growth at low Mn conditions. Crops such as wheat and barley are prone to experience Mn deficiency when they are grown on high pH and low water content soils that are prevalent in northern parts of Europe, USA and China. Therefore, our results suggest a way to improve crop growth under Mn deficient conditions through manipulation of NRAMP2 and NRAMP6.

In hydroponics culture there were six Al addition levels, namely 0 (CK), 50 (Al50), 100 (Al100), 200 (Al200) and 500 μmol L−1 (Al500) and in the pot experiment there were five levels (0, 50, 200, 500 and 1000 mg kg−1). We used two soils, a Hydragric Anthrosol from Guangdong province with a pH of 5.52 (GD) and a Haplic Alisol from Guizhou province with pH of 4.86 (GZ). Hydroponics results indicate that the shoot biomass of S. plumbizincicola decreased with increasing Al addition level but no significant differences were observed in either shoot or root biomass among the different Al treatments. Aluminium addition significantly decreased plant root Cd and Zn uptake. Compared with the control, root Cd and Zn uptake across the different Al treatments declined by 34-69 % and 31-55 %, respectively. However, Al addition did not decrease shoot Cd or Zn uptake significantly. Further study shows that Al stress led to a decline in root diameter, root volume and Cd and Zn adsorption on the root surfaces. Aluminium toxicity symptoms were more apparent in the glasshouse pot experiment as it involved a longer growing period. In both soils, except for the 50 mg kg−1 Al treatment which slightly stimulated the biomass of S. plumbizincicola , Al addition significantly inhibited plant biomass and the plants subjected to the highest Al concentration (1000 mg kg−1) died. Compared with the controls with no Al addition, 91 and 97 % declines in shoot Cd uptake and 90 and 98 % declines in shoot Zn uptake in GD soil and 80 and 84 % declines in shoot Cd uptake and 46 and 62 % declines in shoot Zn uptake in GZ soil were found at 500 and 1000 mg Al kg−1. Analysis of metal distribution and metal chemical forms in the plants indicates that Al taken up was mainly sequestered in the roots and the dominant fractions of Al transported to the shoots were the fraction extracted by 0.6 M HCl and the residual fraction, which had low mobility in the plants. Furthermore, Al addition significantly influenced the chemical forms of Cd and Zn in the stems of S. plumbizincicola , reducing the mobility of Cd and Zn the stems and thus restraining Cd/Zn transfer to the leaves. Significant decreases in pH were observed in the soils after repeated phytoextraction by S. plumbizincicola , therefore Al toxicity may be an important limiting factor in the decontamination of acid soils using S. plumbizincicola.

Thus, it is important to understand the mechanisms of uptake and accumulation. Knowledge of the metal distribution and metal binding to understand the trace metal trafficking and storage, can be obtained using X-ray fluorescence techniques. Synchrotron X-rays in tomography and microspectroscopy provide such information on shock frozen tissues with spatial resolution of some hundreds of nanometers to the micrometer range. However, only very small sections of leaves and roots can be studied. Without additional information, it remains unknown whether the obtained results are representative of the entire leaf or only a feature of a certain region. Due to the high counting time needed for a good signal to noise ratio, only duplicates, and sometimes triplicates can be studied. Using a benchtop X-ray fluorescence machine 2D raster scans of an entire leaf or bigger sections of a root can be obtained. Furthermore, a custom-designed measuring chamber allows for measurements of intact leaves and roots. The combination of the two approaches (synchrotron and benchtop) allows to quantify the variation within the same leaf, and among a bigger set of replicates. In this study tomograms were collected at DESY P06 using the Maia detector. The large solid angle of Maia allows faster data collection with a relatively low dose, which diminishes the risk of beam damage. Raster scans of the fluorescence of whole leaves and roots sections were collected in a customized Bruker M4 TORNADO machine equipped with two large area XFLASH SSD detectors. We show two case studies. The non-accumulator Noccaea ochroleucum exposed to Turnip Yellow Mosaic Virus (TYMV) was studied to understand how the pathogen infection changes the metal distribution in these plants. Both µXRF tomograms and XANES were measured on control and virus-infected leaves. The XANES spectra were compared with model solutions bearing all ligations possible for Zn speciation. XANES revealed a different pattern for the accumulation of Zn for the virus infected plant. In the second case we studied element distribution along the root tips of soybean under Zn deficient and Zn excess conditions. The roots were measured in vivo both with and without desorption of elements in the apoplast.

This is particularly evident in the case of chromium. Chromium (III) is generally an essential nutrient (at low concentrations), whilst the Cr(VI) oxidation state is highly toxic and carcinogenic in humans. Whilst Cr(VI) is well recognized to be highly toxic to a range biota, there is relatively little available data enabling modelling of the terrestrial ecotoxicity of Cr as influenced by environmental factors, such as pH and ionic compositoin of pore-waters. The absorption and toxicity of metallic cations and anions are influenced by the presence of potentially competiting ions, such as calcium and phosphate. A series of models have been proposed accounting for such interactions in the bathing solution around biological membranes. These models include the windermere humic acid model (WHAM), electrostatic and the biotic ligand models (BLM). These models deal almost exclusively with cationic metals such as nickel, copper and zinc and have exluded metallic anions such as arsenate and chromate. In the case of Cr(III), BLM models have been reported in plants and could also potentially be modelled using WHAM. However, the more environmentally concerning Cr(VI) has scarcely been investigated, both in terms of soil solution impacts on phytotoxicity, but also, the development of BLM modelling parameters. In this study, we developed a terrestrial BLM-like model for chromate in soil solution using 10 contrasting soils with a range of pH, bicarbonate, sulphate and phosphate concentrations using Cucumis sativa L.. Plants were exposed to soils with increasing Cr(VI) using a 28 day assay. Soil solution was sampled with Rhizon samplers and chromium speciation determined using liquid chromatography inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results showed that unlike previously reported studies, there was no clear interaction with sulphate or phosphate with chromate toxicity. However, there was a clear interaction between OH- and HCO3-. Therefore, we successfully developed a BLM-like model for chromate which was a function of OH- and HCO3- activities (a root mean squre error of 19.4%). The nature of the interaction between chromate and OH-/HCO3- has implications for intepretation of BLM models, particularly relating to other metallic anions.

Tolerance to Cd and Zn has only been largely studied in A. halleri , while in A. arenosa is neglected. In this study, we compared the impact of high Cd or Zn doses on the photosynthetic apparatus of two A. arenosa and A. halleri ecotypes growing on the same contaminated site in southern Poland. Plants were grown in hydroponic culture during six weeks, and then treated with 1.0 mM Cd or 5.0 mM Zn for 5 days. Chlorophyll a fast fluorescence transients and pigment content were measured after 0, 24, 48, 84 and 120 h of treatment. In both species, exposure to TME excess caused a decrease in chlorophyll and an increase in anthocyanin contents in leaves compared with control conditions. The maximum quantum efficiency of the PSII (φP0) was significantly lower after 84 h Cd treatment in A. halleri and after 120 h in A. arenosa. Zn treatment significantly lowered φP0 in A. halleri after 120 h, while it had no impact in A. arenosa. After 5 d Cd treatment, the energy absorbance, electron transport flux and the percentage of active reaction centres decreased more in A. arenosa than in A. halleri. However, the electron transport flux was less affected in than in the second species. Zn treatment had comparatively less toxic effect than Cd excess on A. halleri and it caused only a decrease in the electron transport flux. On the other hand, A. arenosa plants treated with Zn excess reacted as strongly as with Cd and all energy fluxes significantly decreased. The two species showed contrasting behaviour in TME accumulation. A. arenosa accumulated almost three times more Cd in shoots than A. halleri. On the opposite, three-fold higher Zn concentration was measured in A. halleri leaves compared to A. arenosa. Our results supported hyper-tolerance of both species to high Cd or Zn doses. However, the photosynthetic apparatus of two metallicolous tested ecotypes responded differently to the TME treatments.

Wub and F-J Zhaoa a College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, China bInstitute of Vegetables and Flowers, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences 2016203015@njau.edu.cn Cadmium (Cd) is a toxic metal for living organisms. Humans are exposed to Cd mainly from the consumption of foods, among which vegetables are an important dietary source. Brassicas are important vegetables, but can also accumulate relatively high levels of Cd in the edible parts. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms controlling Cd accumulation in Brassica vegetables. In a hydroponic experiment, we found large variations in the Cd concentrations in the roots and shoots, as well as the ratio of shoot to root Cd concentrations, among 64 cultivars of Brassica rapa. Because the P1B-type heavy metal ATPase 3 (HMA3) has been shown to play an important role in controlling the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd in rice and Arabidopsis thaliana, we sequenced the BrHMA3 genes in all cultivars and found nine different alleles in the coding region, with five full-length alleles and four truncated alleles. Cultivars with the truncated alleles had on average x times higher Cd concentration in the shoots, and x times higher shoot to root Cd concentration ratio, than those possessing the full-length alleles. Heterologous expression of the nine BrHMA3 alleles in yeast showed Cd transport activities for the full-length alleles, but not for the truncated alleles, suggesting that the two types of alleles represent functional and weak or non-functional alleles, respectively. These two types of alleles explained 87% of the variance in the root-to-shoot Cd translocation among the 64 cultivars. We developed an F2 segregation population from a cross between a low-Cd cultivar with a functional allele and a high-Cd cultivar with a non-functional allele of BrHMA3. The BrHMA3 genotype explained 84.7% of the variance in the shoot to root Cd concentration ratio among the F2 progeny. Subcellular localization of BrHMA3 showed that it is localized at the tonoplast. Expression of a functional allele of BrHMA3 in both Arabidopsis thaliana and rice decreased the root-to-shoot translocation of Cd significantly. Taken together, our results show that allelic variation in the coding region of BrHMA3 is a key determinant of Cd accumulation in the shoots of Brassica rapa. Functional alleles of BrHMA3 can be used to breed low Cd cultivars.

Bioavailable concentrations of trace metals in the environment and agriculture are vastly different (with natural and anthropogenic causes) in various habitats, ranging from deficient to toxic levels. Therefore, research has focused on response to trace metals by plants and photosynthetic model organisms (algae and bacteria) in terms of uptake, transport, sequestration, speciation, deficiency, toxicity and detoxification. Most early and even numerous recent studies have used environmentally not relevant conditions. This applies in particular to extremely high, environmentally and agriculturally not relevant concentrations of toxic metals and metalloids. Further, individual processes often were not mechanistically interconnected, so that causes and consequences of metal(loid) effects remained unclear. In this contribution, recent insights are shown, mostly in the (sub-)nanomolar range of metal concentrations, with a simulation of natural light- and temperature cycles and trying to interconnect individual effects. The submerged rootless water plant Ceratophyllum demersum turned out to be a useful shoot model, allowing to assess effects on photosynthetic tissues without interaction with root toxicity. In this model it could be shown that metal(loid) (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni) concentrations that were previously considered as not having any effect actually have a strong impact on the plants, and with a different sequence of events than observed at very high concentrations. In addition, Soybean (Glycine max) was used as a model for terrestrial plants and crops. We used a combination of various biophysical and biochemical methods for measurements in vivo (e.g. photosynthesis biophysics, formation of reactive oxygen species, metal transport), in situ (e.g. quantitative (sub)cellular distribution and speciation of metals, mRNA levels) as well as on isolated proteins (for identification and characterization of metalloproteins) and metabolites (metabolomics). For example, using metalloproteomics via HPLC-ICPMS of protein extracts from stressed plants, changes in target sites of metal binding to proteins from deficient to toxic concentrations could be analyzed. X-ray absorption (XANES) and fluorescence (µXRF) provided information about metal(loid) speciation and distribution. The combination of techniques clearly showed metal(loid)-induced changes in the metabolism, already at very low concentrations, and allowed for new insights into the mechanisms of sublethal toxicity of As, Cd and Cu.

However, few genes have been identified due to a lack of efficient method to screen libraries of mutated plants for individuals which have unusual characteristics in metal uptake and distribution. Screening requires the analysis of thousands of randomly mutated plants, but most techniques for quantifying metals are poorly suited for high-throughput analysis of large populations. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) allows for quantitative and simultaneous measurement of a range of elements and is useful for determining the metal concentration in whole plants or organs, but it lacks spatial resolution. Identification of the spatial distribution of metals in specific tissues and organs would be more useful for the identification of unusual individuals. In addition, ICP-MS analyses are destructive and requires a comparatively large amount of work to prepare samples (e.g. grinding, acid digestion), especially when used for thousands of mutated plants. With the development of a new generation of fast fluorescence detector systems, synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence microscopy (µ-XRF) provides a unique capability of obtaining the elemental distribution in vivo with minimal sample preparation, and importantly it is a rapid, sensitive and non-destructive method. In this study, we develop µ-XRF as a high-throughput method to screen mutant libraries of rice and Arabidopsis thaliana seed with the phenotype of altered metal accumulation / distribution in whole intact seeds. This is particularly important in plant biology given that the identification of genes involved in metal metabolism requires the ‘screening’ of thousands of genetic variants.

We showed here that, OsZIP4, a member of the ZIP (ZRT, IRT-like protein), showed high expression in the basal node, tiller bud and shoot SAM at the vegetative stage, but higher expression was also found in the node I at the reproductive stage of rice (Oryza sativa). Immunostaining revealed that the OsZIP4 was localized at the phloem parenchyma cells and phloem transfer cells of enlarged and diffuse vascular bundles in both basal and upper nodes. Knockout of OsZIP4 resulted in significant decrease in development of the tiller buds, but increase in Zn levels were observed in the shoot basal region at tillering stage. Not only less Zn levels in the young panicles at panicle initiation (PT) stage but also in the flag leaf blade and in brown rice during the reproductive growth stage in the knockout lines as compared with the wild-type rice. A short-term experiment with the 67Zn stable isotope showed that more Zn was accumulated in the nodes, whereas less Zn in the newly developed meristem tissues, indicating that OsZIP4 is essential for transport and distribute Zn out of nodes to the developing tissues. In short, OsZIP4 located in the node is responsible for unloading Zn from the phloem of enlarged vascular bundles, which is playing an important role in preferential distribution of zinc to the developing tissues in rice, which is critical for their development in rice.

Flavonoids are phenolic compounds with antioxidant properties which play a pivotal role in human health and diet, and are major actors during plant stress responses. Ionomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic data from Arabidopsis species showing contrasting metal tolerance and accumulation highlight a new role for flavonoids in the regulation of metal homeostasis and adaptation to extreme metallic environments. A major role for flavonoids during metal stresses was confirmed by using A. thaliana mutants impaired in flavonoid biosynthesis and signal transduction. Moreover, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance data also support flavonoids ability to form a complex with metals. However, no information is available on the role of flavonoids in the regulation of metal uptake, translocation and accumulation in plants. Our research aims at filling this gap by studying physiological, molecular and biochemical processes that plants use to regulate micronutrient homeostasis.

Cadmium pollution poses a serious problem to China, meanwhile, due to the huge pressure of food demand, the moderately polluted land covering a large area must continue to be engaged in high-intensity agricultural production, which is difficult to be used for remediation alone. Therefore, environmental remediation not only has a long way to go, but also relies on novel strategies that are totally different from those taken in developed countries. Chinese scientists previously proposed a strategy to combine low-accumulation crop germplasm resources with heavy metal hyperaccumulator plants. However, this strategy passively relying on natural plants and the environment faces the following bottlenecks: 1) Low-accumulation traits of heavy metals in existing crop germplasm resources are significantly affected by the environment, and the effect is difficult to control. 2) natural heavy metal low-accumulation crops are often accompanied by the low accumulation of essential nutrients, which have certain negative impacts on the nutritional quality and yield of crops; 3) natural hyperaccumulators grow slowly, have small biomass, and compete for the effective cultivation area. Due to those considerations, we propose the concept of “remediation-rice”, which specifically blocks the migration of heavy metal to edible parts to meet the food safety requirements, and promotes heavy metal accumulation in rice straws, allowing phytoremediation of heavy metals meanwhile producing safe grains in polluted paddy fields. The recent progress of our research team has conceptually verified the feasibility of “remediation-rice”, and the most recent progress will also be reported.

The best characterized SNF is the one carried out between legumes and a group of soil bacteria known as rhizobia. Through a complex process these bacteria colonize plant cells of newly developed plant organs, the nodules. There, rhizobia are surrounded by a plant-derived membrane in an organelle-like structure called symbiosome, where rhizobia differentiates into a specialized nitrogen fixing form called bacteroid. This process requires an intense nutrient trafficking between the symbionts, especially of transition metals (copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo) and zinc (Zn)) to satisfy the synthesis of both plant and bacterial metalloenzymes. However, in spite of the importance that metals have on SNF, it remains largely unknown how these micronutrients are delivered to the nodule and to the symbiosome. Using synchrotron-based X-ray fluorescence (XRF) to study Fe distribution in the nodules of model legume Medicago truncatula, a heterogeneous pattern in different developmental zones of the nodule was observed. At the apical zone, Fe has a spotty, extracellular distribution. In the infection zone, we observed a progressive internalization of the metal in the infected cells, and finally their accumulation in the bacteroids within the nitrogen-fixation zone. Expanding on these results using μXRF and μXANES (X-ray Absorption Near Edge Structure) on frozen hydrated samples, we have observed that the local coordination environment of Fe and Fe oxidation state change longitudinally too. In the apical regions Fe3+ is the most abundant species, while Fe2+ is more prevalent in the fixation zone. Searching for a more detailed Fe localization we have performed nanoXRF analysis, and nanotomography to assess morphological changes. In future studies we plan to use these techniques to investigate other essential elements for root nodulation such as Cu, Zn and Mo. Altogether, these snapshots helped us to propose a model of Fe transport in the nodule, which in the long term would support the selection of better symbiotic partners for a sustainable agriculture, as well as design organ-specific fortification programs mimicking mechanisms developed in the nodule.

As content in water, sediment, totora plants and periphyton (assemblage of algae and bacteria growing on totora stems), As speciation and localization in periphyton, and As speciation in water were determined. Results showed very little As transfer in totora, and highly variable As accumulation in periphyton.

Recent studies have reported high levels of Cd in cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) beans from Ecuador (average 0.9 mg Cd kg-1 bean), which has raised concerns on its future trade due to difficulties to comply with food safety regulations. The problem of high Cd concentrations in cacao beans from Ecuador is unrelated to point pollution but a geogenic one, combined with cacao being a plant with high affinity for Cd uptake (Cd accumulator). Managing Cd in cacao requires an understanding of the processes affecting soil Cd bioavailability. Soil factors such as total Cd, pH and organic carbon content are the main factors explaining Cd concentration in cacao beans. Since cacao is a perennial crop with deep-rooted soil horizons it is important to understand the functionality of the root structures on Cd uptake. Here we hypothesized that the origin of shoot Cd in cacao is affected by the distribution of roots in the soil and bioavailable Cd. A pot experiment with cacao seedlings was conducted to better understand and quantify the contribution of rooted soil compartments (top-or bottom soil) on the concentration of Cd in cacao leaves using 108Cd as a tracer. Pots contained superimposed soils (top and bottom) that differed in Cd availability either by liming (soil pH raised from 5.6 to 6.5) or by using soils with contrasting properties (surface soil with high Cd and subsurface soil low Cd) to evaluate its effect on Cd source apportionment. The first new leaf on each plant was harvested after 7 weeks of growth and 108Cd and 111Cd were measured by ICP-MS after nitric acid digestion. Results showed that 57% of Cd in the shoot was derived from the top soil compartment in plants grown in fully non-limed soils. When only the top compartment soil was limed, the majority (67%) of Cd in the shoot derived from the bottom compartment soil. By liming top and bottom soils, 68% of Cd in the shoot derived from the top compartment. In plants grown in two contrasting soils (surface over subsoil), about 60% of Cd in the shoot was derived from the top compartment and this fraction was observed independently if the surface top soil was limed. In contrasting soils, Cd in the shoot significantly reduced by a factor 2 when top soil was limed. Surprisingly, no significant difference in shoot Cd was observed in plants grown in surface soil with or without liming. At the conference results from 4 months growth will be presented and will be discussed with root biomass of the plants.

Holley Center for Agriculture and Health, Cornell University, USA c Global Institute for Food Security, University of Saskatchewan, Canada yqwang@gzhu.edu.cn. Members of the aquaporin (AQP) family have been suggested to transport aluminum (Al) in plants; however, the Al form transported by AQPs and the roles of AQPs in Al tolerance remain elusive. Here we report that NIP1;2, a plasma membrane-localized member of the Arabidopsis nodulin 26-like intrinsic protein (NIP) subfamily of the AQP family, facilitates Al-malate transport from the root cell wall into the root symplasm, with subsequent Al xylem loading and root-to shoot translocation, which are critical steps in an internal Al tolerance mechanism in Arabidopsis. We found that NIP1;2 transcripts are expressed mainly in the root tips, and that this expression is enhanced by Al but not by other metal stresses. Mutations in NIP1;2 lead to hyperaccumulation of toxic Al3+ in the root cell wall, inhibition of root-to-shoot Al translocation, and a significant reduction in Al tolerance. NIP1;2 facilitates the transport of Al-malate, but not Al3+ ions, in both yeast and Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that the formation of the Al-malate complex in the root tip apoplast is a prerequisite for NIP1;2-mediated Al removal from the root cell wall, and that this requires a functional root malate exudation system mediated by the Al-activated malate transporter, ALMT1. Taken together, these findings reveal a critical linkage between the previously identified Al exclusion mechanism based on root malate release and an internal Al tolerance mechanism identified here through the coordinated function of NIP1;2 and ALMT1, which is required for Al removal from the root cell wall, root-to-shoot Al translocation, and overall Al tolerance in Arabidopsis.

Higher specific surface area and reactivity of ZnO-NPs compared to bulky ZnO may improve Zn solubility, diffusion in soil and hence better Zn availability to plants. Nano-fertilizers can supply essential nutrients for plant growth, have higher use efficiency and can be delivered in a timely manner to a rhizospheric target or by foliar spray. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of different concentrations of ZnO-NPs on plant growth attributes, grain yield and final Zn levels in rice crop compared with conventional delivery of Zn. Methods: Solution culture and greenhouse experiments were carried out to study the impact of ZnO-NPs with a mean particle size of 30 nm on rice plant growth traits, Zn concentration and yield. For comparative study, different concentrations of ZnO-NPs were used as compared to conventional ZnSO4. 7H2O (10 mg/kg) fertilizer and control (no Zn). Results and Discussion: The highest root and shoot length, dry weight and grain yield was recorded with the application of nanoscale ZnO at 10 mg/kg which shows higher growth and yield differed from that of ZnSO4 and control thus confirming better interaction between nanoparticles and rhizosphere. The highest germination percentage of 91.7 was observed when the rice seeds were treated with the nanoscale ZnO at 100 mg/kg; and it was significantly more than that of control and ZnSO4. Higher doses of ZnO nanoparticle had negatively influenced the plant growth and yield parameters. The delivery of Zn through ZnO-NPs resulted in positive effect on seed germination, root and shoot growth, seedling vigour index, number of tillers, had higher chlorophyll content, Zn concentration and grain yield. Application of ZnO-NPs supplied Zn, had higher use efficiency, better plant growth and significantly improved the yield. Conclusion: Delivery of Zn nutrient through ZnO nanoparticles in right dose, right time and of the right size could be effective and beneficial in enhancing the growth and yield attributes of rice crop. There is a possibility of reducing dose of Zn using nanostructured fertilizer like ZnO- NPs.

This Fe-dependent redox toxicity can be used to prevent the spread of pathogen infection, but also inhibits plant growth, reduces rice yield in flooded conditions or acerbates the deficiency of other nutrients such as phosphate deficiency. In agriculture, serious symptoms of Fe toxicity have been recognized in rice for more than half a century. It is estimated that 19% of the total area for rice production in Africa harbors a potential risk for Fe toxicity. Therefore, engineering Fe toxicity tolerant rice varieties would be highly desirable. However, more than twenty attempts over the past two decades were not successful in identifying genes responsible for the variation of Fe toxicity tolerance in rice using linkage and association mappings. Thus, unlike several important molecular components involved in Fe uptake, transport and homeostasis have been identified in past decades, the genes and mechanisms are responsible for plant tolerance to this Fe-dependent redox toxicity are largely unknown in both plants and animals. We identified S-nitrosoglutathione-reductase (GSNOR) variants underlying a major quantitative locus for root tolerance to Fe-toxicity using genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis thaliana that are under much less artificial selection (domestication) compared with crops. These GSNOR variants act largely through transcript level regulation. GSNOR maintains root meristem activity under high Fe levels and prevents cell death via inhibiting Fe-dependent nitrosative and oxidative cytotoxicity, which reveals that nitric oxide is also required to generating Fe-dependent redox toxicity. Moreover, we demonstrated that GSNOR is required for root tolerance to Fe-toxicity throughout higher plants such as legumes and monocots. Our findings not only shed light the underlying quantitative genetic and molecular mechanisms of plant adaptation to Fe-dependent redox toxicity, but also expose GSNOR as a prime target for genetic editing or marker-assisted breeding to develop crop varieties tolerant to Fe-dependent toxicity and help to increase rice productivity in regions with potential Fe toxicity.

Rice is a staple food for over half of the world’s population that is a major dietary source of Se. In paddy soils, rice roots mainly take up selenite via phosphate transporters and aquaporin. Se speciation analysis indicated that most of the selenite absorbed by rice is predominantly transformed into selenomethinone (SeMet) and retained in roots. However, the mechanism by which SeMet is transported in plants remains largely unknown. In our study, SeMet uptake was found to be an energy-dependent symport process involving H+ transport, with neutral amino acids strongly inhibiting SeMet uptake. We further revealed that NRT1.1B, a member of rice peptide transporter (PTR) family which plays an important role in nitrate uptake and transport in rice, displays SeMet transport activity in yeast and Xenopus oocyte. The uptake rate of SeMet in the roots and its accumulation rate in the shoots of nrt1.1b mutant were significantly repressed. Conversely, the overexpression of NRT1.1B in rice significantly promoted SeMet translocation from roots to shoots, resulting in increased Se concentrations in shoots and rice grains. With vascular-specific expression of NRT1.1B , the grain Se concentration was 1.83-fold higher than that of wild type. These results strongly demonstrate that NRT1.1B holds great potential for the improvement of Se concentrations in grains by facilitating SeMet translocation, and the findings provide novel insight into breeding of Se-enriched rice varieties.

Ma Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University, Japan pdqr7242@s.okayama-u.ac.jp Silicon (Si) is a beneficial element for rice, a typical Si-accumulating plant. Si is able to improve nutrient imbalance in rice, but the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms for this effect are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the interaction between Si and zinc (Zn) in rice by using a mutant (lsi1) defective in Si uptake and its wild type (WT, cv. Oochikara) in terms of toxicity and accumulation. Si did not alleviate high Zn-induced inhibition of root elongation in both mutant and WT. However, Si supply decreased Zn concentration in both the roots and shoots of the WT although similar effect was not observed in the lsi1 mutant. The root-to-shoot translocation and distribution in different leaves of Zn was not altered by Si in both the WT and lsi1 mutant. In the WT, Si supply at 0.2 mM for 7 days was able to decrease Zn concentration in the roots and shoots. Furthermore, Si supply with 1 mM for three days was required to decrease Zn accumulation because one day exposure to 1 mM Si did not show the effect. Si supply also resulted in decreased Zn in the root cell sap and xylem sap in the WT, but this effect of Si was not observed in the mutant. These results indicate that Si and Zn interaction did not occur in the solution and that high Si accumulation in the shoots is required to decrease Zn uptake. To confirm this, we performed a short-term (30 min) uptake experiment with stable isotope 67Zn. The results showed that 67Zn uptake was significantly decreased by Si in WT, but not in the mutant. Furthermore, pre-treatment with Si also showed similar effect. When grown in paddy field, lsi1 showed higher Zn concentration in the straw, husk and brown rice than the WT. These results lead us to propose that some Zn transporter genes involved in Zn uptake are down-regulated by Si accumulated in the shoots. Further work on characterization of Zn transporter genes are being undertaken.

Brauna, E. Pischkea, M. Webera and S. Clemensa aPlant Physiology, Bayreuth University, Germany colleen.rafferty@uni-bayreuth.de Lead (Pb) is a non-essential, highly toxic element. As it forms stable complexes with organic matter and adsorbs to Al-, Fe- and Mn-oxides it is highly persistent in soil, accumulating in the environment and posing a threat to human health. To prevent the potentially harmful effects of a long-term human Pb exposition by food consumption and to take measures for the elimination of Pb in the environment profound knowledge of the processes underlying Pb uptake, translocation and accumulation in plants is of great importance. At present our knowledge regarding these mechanisms lags far behind arsenic and cadmium. This can be mainly attributed to Pb having a low solubility at a pH greater than 5, as well as the formation of Pb-phosphate precipitates, making it challenging to analyze plant-Pb interactions in commonly used experimental settings. We have therefore developed a novel low-phosphate, low-pH assay system, enabling the analysis of plant Pb toxicity and tolerance under realistic Pb concentrations. This is being used for two different approaches: (i) the search for relevant genes and proteins by studying induced or natural genetic variation; (ii) the physiological analysis of Pb uptake and accumulation in the model cereal barley. Evidence is available for Pb uptake via hitch-hiking of transporters for essential elements, e.g. Ca2+ channels and Pb detoxification by the phytochelatin pathway. To find additional factors involved in Pb toxicity and tolerance we tested metal hypersensitive EMS mutants isolated in our lab for Pb hypersensitivity and identified one mutant. We will report the identification and functional characterization of the causal gene responsible for the phenotype. Furthermore, we could detect pronounced natural variation in A. thaliana Pb tolerance. This enabled the identification of quantitative trait loci involved in Pb toxicity effects through a genome wide association study. For this over 300 ecotypes were screened regarding their Pb phenotype and the correlation between respective phenotype and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was determined. Additionally, we characterized a Pb hypersensitive ecotype, which we discovered and collected ourselves. The SNPs we found converged into the same metabolic pathway that is affected by Pb stress and possibly involved in tolerance. Considering the mobility and accumulation of Pb in crops in our second approach we use Hordeum vulgare as a model crop plant. We have analyzed three different ecotypes of H. vulgare, which display contrasting profiles of grain micronutrient accumulation. For the first time we could detect Pb in the grain of barley both after hydroponic and contaminated soil cultivation. The screening for ecotypes which accumulate an enhanced amount of essential elements combined with a decreased accumulation of toxic elements is an important tool towards diminishing the entry of pollutants into the food web.

In addition to enhanced uptake, Pteris vittata also exhibit efficient arsenic translocation from roots to fronds. Arsenate reductase PvACR2 has been identified which played an important role in arsenate reduction process. However, the molecular mechanism of arsenate reduction and key arsenate reductase enzyme in fronds of Pteris vittata is still unclear. Currently, we cloned two HAC (High Arsenic Content) homologous genes, PvHAC1 and PvHAC2, in Pteris vittata. PvHAC1 and PvHAC2 were predominantly expressed in fronds. PvHAC1 transcripts were strongly induced response to AsV exposure, no significant altered under AsIII treatment. Furthermore, we heterologous expressed PvHAC1 in ∆arsC E. coli mutant, which lacking the endogenous arsenate reductase. Under different concentrations of arsenate stress, heterologous expressing of PvHAC1 could complement the growth of mutants and significantly enhance the tolerance of the transformants to arsenate. The concentration of arsenite in the medium was also significantly higher than that of the control. Though prokaryotic expression system, the purified HAC1 protein has been shown to have arsenic reductase activity. PvHAC1-eGFP was localized in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In summary, PvHAC1 is an AsV reductase that is critical for AsV detoxification in Pteris vittata fronds. The functional identification of PvHAC1 provided an insight into enhancing plant arsenic tolerance and decreasing arsenic accumulation by genetic engineering in future.

A. arenosa occurs naturally both in diploid and tetraploid form, in contrast to A. halleri in which only diploid forms were found. The presence of diploid and tetraploid forms in A. arenosa may cause that selected populations of this species are capable of growing on heavy metal (HM) contaminated sites. Therefore, A. arenosa may be considered as very interesting research object of the mechanisms of HM accumulation and tolerance in plants. The aim of this study was to characterized the ecophysiology of several populations of A. arenosa from Central Europe. Sites with metallicolous (M) and non-metallicolous (NM) populations of A. arenosa were selected in Poland, Slovakia and Hungary. Populations in Slovakia and Hungary were selected on the basis of literature. Polish populations were selected on the basis of a preliminary research. The ploidy of each population were also taken into account. From each site 10 individual plants with soil samples were collected. Then plant and soil samples were acid digested in a microwave-assisted wet digestion system ETHOS1 (Milestone, Italy) and metal concentration was measured using flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer iCE 3500 FAAS (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA). Chlorophyll, anthocyanin and flavonol content were measured in situ on selected plants before their collection using Dualex Scientific+ (Force-A, France) sensor. The average annual temperature and precipitation values for the period 1982 to 2012 were determined using www.climate-data.org. The maximum value of chlorophyll content was observed in plants from Vernar (NM). The lowest value was recorded for metallicolous population from Bukowno (M). Moreover, a comparatively high chlorophyll content in the M population in Piekary Śląskie was also observed. The highest content of flavonols and anthocyanins were measured for populations from Miasteczko Śląskie (M) and Piekary Śląskie (M), which was positively correlated with the HM contamination of soil. The lowest content of both flavonols and anthocyanins were observed for populations from Szopienice (M) and Tematin (NM). The PCA analyses showed that populations grouped into five clusters: diploid populations inhabited warm sites (Hungary); tertraploid populations characterized by the low content of flavonols and anthocyanins; tetraploid M populations from Upper Silesia; tetraploid populations from nonmetalicollous but contaminated with HM sites; NM mountain populations from Slovakia. On the basis of the results of PCA analyses it is tempting to suggest that the climatic factors as well as ploidy level may determine the physiological status of plants. The increase of anthocyanin content seems to be the HM stress marker in situ. The increased content of flavonols may be related with a harsh environment. At the present state of investigations the changes in chlorophyll content seems to be not specific.

Li Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, Key Laboratory of Plant-Soil Interactions of the Ministry of Education / College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, PRC valcoyu@126.com Pak choi (Brassica chinensis) is a vastly consumed leafy vegetable in China, yet it is also a potential accumulator for cadmium (Cd). Therefore, it is of great urgency to reduce the Cd content in the edible part of the pak choi. There have been numerous reports of selenium (Se) regulating Cd accumulation in plants; however, considering the different experimental conditions, the results are now paradoxical, and the underling mechanisms remain unclear. Some researchers attributed such Se effects to the complexation between selenocompounds and Cd because of the chemical similarity between Se and sulfur (S). This study investigated Se transformation and how Se species affected Cd accumulation in pak choi exposed to either of selenite and selenate for different times under hydroponic conditions. The addition of both Se forms insignificantly increased the Cd content in shoots with 1 h of exposure before a gradually enhanced reducing effect of selenite was observed. The selenite-induced reduction was maintained comparable after 72 h, and became significant after 96 h; the differences were 4% and 30% at 24 and 168 h, respectively, compared to the Cd content in shoots treated with only Cd. On the other hand, there was no significant in the Cd content between the selenate and Cd alone treatments at any time. Nonetheless, selenate enhanced Cd accumulation in shoots by approximately 1/4 at both 72 and 96 h, and began to dismiss it by no more than 1/5 after 120 h of exposure, which was 2 d later than selenite did. Five Se species were discovered in pak choi; because of the distinct accumulation capacity of selenite and selenate, the total Se content and that of every Se species in selenate-treated plants were much higher than those in selenite-treated ones. However, after 24 h, organic Se such as selenomethionine (SeMet) and Se-methylselenocysteine (SeMeCys) accounted for roughly 3/5 in shoots and 9/10 in roots of selenite-treated plants, which were much higher than those in selenate-treated plants where SeO42- was of 70% in shoots and 30% in roots. A substantial increase in proportions of organic Se species and a sharp decline in that of SeO42- were found under both Se treatments, and Se transformation into seleno amino acids was in accordance with the dynamics of Se affecting Cd accumulation in the shoot. In conclusion, Se could reduce Cd accumulation in the edible part of pak choi after certain times; the selenate-induced reduction was exhibited much later and less significant than the selenite-induced one. The different effects of the two Se forms applied should be attributed to their transformation in the plant. Most of the selenate taken up remained as SeO42-, whereas selenite in the plant was readily assimilated to seleno amino acids; SeMet was invariably the dominant organic species whose content showed the greatest increase among those of the five species detected over the exposure times. Hence, Se effects on Cd accumulation could depend on the exposure times, where SeMet and SeO42­- contents, their relative proportions, and Se transformation were also involved in the Se-mediated regulation.

Plants are important potential receptors given that they are at the base of the food chain and can be particularly impacted by multiple exposure routes as they are at the interface between three environmental compartments; air, soil and water. CNTs can be described as seamless rolled layers of graphene forming nanotubes. CNTs can be formed of one layer (Single Walled CNTs), two layers (Double Walled CNTs) or more (Multi Walled CNTs). Accordingly, their diameter can vary from below 1 to ca. 100 nm. Their length can also differ (from Five different types of CNTs were used for this experiment: raw and oxidized DWCNTs, raw and oxidized MWCNTs, and short length raw MWCNTs. An agricultural sandy loam soil was contaminated using these five CNTs at three concentrations (0.1, 10 and 100 mg/kg). Different morphological and metabolism biomarkers were evaluated at the end of the five-week exposure. Nutrient concentrations in the leaves and roots were analysed by ICP-OES. Biomacromolecular changes in leaves were studied using Fourier transformed infra-red spectroscopy by developing a chemometric analysis. Candidate genes expression was analysed in the leaves using qPCR. The results show that the different physico-chemical parameters of CNTs significantly influence their impacts on canola plants. Only the DWCNTs (smaller diameter) had impacts on canola. Functionalization also influences the effects of CNTs.

This plant has good ability to grow on soils contaminated by lead (Pb). We used Hirschfeldia incana as a model for molecular characterization of Pb tolerance and accumulation in plants. Microarrays comparison of gene expression between H. incana and a susceptible plant to Pb (Arabidopsis thaliana) , enabled the identification of a set of specific genes expressed in response to lead exposure. The number of genes specifically regulated by Pb in H. incana was higher in shoots than in roots, with 602 and 341 genes, respectively. Four groups of genes were particularly over-represented due to the Pb exposure and are categorized into biological processes as photosynthesis, cell wall, transport and metal handling. Expression profile of a subset of differentially regulated genes involved specifically in transport and metal handling was also checked by qRT-PCR in H. incana. Our results suggest a possible scenario of Pb tolerance and accumulation mechanisms in H. incana. In roots, Pb is probably chelated with defensins at the cytosol level and interact with membrane transporters. Then, HMA4 a P-type ATPase transporter may play a role in Pb translocation to aerial parts through the xylem. Once in the leaves, ferritin and Metalothinein can play an essential role in Pb distribution in leaves and Pb binding and sequestration in cells. MRP14 transporter can be involved in the Pb storage in the vacuoles probably in a conjugate form (glutathione-Pb). Another transporter, GCN2 from the ABCF family, can contributed in Pb storage in chloroplast. This study provided new insights into the molecular mechanisms of Pb tolerance and accumulation in plants and opens new ways for the study and the selection of heavy metals tolerant plants.

Gao PeiPeia, Xue P. Y.a and Liu W. J.a a College of Resource and Environmental Sciences, HeBei Agricultural University, China 15733202835@163.com As the biggest freshwater wetland in North China, Baiyangdian Lake is facing the problems of eutrophication and sediment contamination by heavy metals especially for Pb and Cd. Submerged macrophyte has shown tremendous potential to remove pollutants from water. In addition, since submerged plants are exposed to both overlying water and sediment, the translocation of metals in plants can affect their biogeochemical cycle in water system. However, there is little information available on the influences of N and P, which are the key limiting nutrients in eutrophication, on heavy metal translocation in submerged plants. As a result, effects of N and P nutrient on Pb translocation and accumulation in submerged macrophyte Potamogeton crispus L. were investigated. Root of P. crispus were exposed to 50 mg/kg Pb contaminated sediment with different N (NH4NO3) and P (KH2PO4) concentrations (N 0.5 g/kg, N 5 g/kg, N0.5+P0.5 g/kg, N 5+P5 g/kg) to explore the influence of macronutrient on Pb translocation and accumulation of Pb in sediment- submerged plant-water system using the sequestered chamber. Results showed that Pb accumulation in plants decreased in the order of leaves>stems>roots. N addition in sediment showed no significant influence on Pb accumulation in roots, while promoted upward translocation of Pb, with translocation factor (TF) of N 0.5 and N 5 treatment increased by 36.76% and 17.48%, respectively, compared with that of control treatment (CK, without N and P). Therefore, bioaccumulation of Pb in shoot was enhanced after N addition in sediment. Bioaccumulation factor (BCF) of Pb in shoot of P. Crispus of N 0.5 and N 5 treatment was 36.76% and 17.48% higher than that of CK, respectively. Furthermore, after P addition in sediment, Pb accumulation in plants were significantly inhibited compared with single N treatment probably due to the immobilization of Pb by P in sediment. Pb concentrations in plant roots of N0.5+P0.5 and N5+P5 treatment was reduced by 82% and 85% compared with that of N0.5 and N 5 treatment, respectively. However, P in sediment inhibited translocation of Pb from root to shoot, TF of N0.5+P0.5 and N5+P5 treatment was reduced by 12% and 38% compared with that of N0.5 and N 5 treatment, respectively. The TF was >1 in all conditions, indicating that P. crispus promotes the translocation of Pb to shoots, while it was more obvious after adding P in sediment.On the basis of this experiment, the translocation and accumulation of Pb by P. crispus is affected by nitrogen and phosphate, and therefore, it can be a good candidate for the phytofiltration of this contaminant in different trophic level sediment.

Zhou, Z. Li and P Christie Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China lhwu@issas.ac.cn Analysis of stable metal isotopic ratios provides a novel tool to explore metal uptake and transfer mechanisms in soil-plant systems. In this study a pot experiment was conducted to investigate cadmium (Cd) isotope fractionation after repeated phytoextraction by the Cd and zinc (Zn) hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola with five successive crops in four highly Cd-contaminated agricultural soils. Two of the soils were paddy soils (S1 and S4) and the other two were upland soils (S2 and S3) collected from lead-zinc mining areas in Hunan province, central China. The Cd isotopic composition of all four soils was determined before and after five crops of phytoextraction, in the shoots of the first crop of S. plumbizincicola , and in the NH4Ac-extractable Cd pool of soils S1 (pH 5.73) and S3 (pH 7.23) before and after repeated phytoextraction. In the initial soils before phytoextraction the Cd extracted by NH4Ac was isotopically lighter than or showed no significant difference from soil total Cd (Δ114/110Cdextract−soil = -0.152 to 0.007 ‰). In addition, larger fractionation of light isotopes between the NH4Ac-extractable Cd and total Cd in the paddy soil S1 (Δ114/110Cdextract−soil = -0.152‰) than the upland soil S3 (Δ114/110Cdextract−soil = 0.007‰) indicates that more Cd leaching from paddy soil than from upland soil preferentially removes heavy Cd isotopes. Cadmium in the shoots of S. plumbizincicola was significantly isotopically heavier than Cd in soils (Δ114/110Cdshoot−soil = 0.022 to 0.132‰) and Cd in the soils after phytoextraction was significantly isotopically lighter than Cd in soils before phytoextraction (Δ114/110Cdsoil: P5−soil: P0 = -0.146 to -0.032‰). This demonstrates that S. plumbizincicola favours heavy Cd isotopes. However, there was no significant isotope fractionation between Cd extracted by NH4Ac and Cd in shoots, implying that NH4Ac-extractable Cd constitutes the plant-available Cd pool to S. plumbizincicola. After phytoextraction, NH4Ac-extractable Cd isotopes significantly fractionated with Δ114/110Cdextract: P5−extract: P0 values of 0.074 to 0.180 ‰. This may result from the replenishment of heavier isotopes from other soil Cd pools. Based on a previous observation that S. plumbizincicola was enriched in light Zn isotopes, this suggests that S. plumbizincicola may have a Cd uptake and transfer mechanism different from Zn. Sedum plumbizincicola may have a special channel for Cd transportation which leads to an enrichment of heavy Cd isotopes in the aboveground parts. This is inconsistent with the supposition that plants take up Cd via their Zn transport systems.

Li Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation, Key Laboratory of Plant-Soil Interactions of the Ministry of Education / College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, PRC zheliu@cau.edu.cn Cadmium (Cd) is an important heavy metal pollutant in farmland soils due to various anthropogenic activities, such as utilization of chemical fertilizers, wastewater irrigation, and sewage sludge, large areas of cultivated soils worldwide have been contaminated by Cd, in the past decades. Cd inhibits physiological processes and normal growth and reduces the biomass and yield of plants. Therefore, it is of great urgency to explore new ways for reducing the Cd content in the cultivated soils. The results from few existing studies on the effects of sulfate supply on Cd availability in soil are conflicting. In order to investigate the effect of sulfate on the migration and transformation of cadmium（Cd）in soil system, sufficient sulfate were applied to the two levels exogenous Cd-contaminated soil, soil solution was collected during four months soil culture test, and measuring pH, conductivity, cadmium content and other indicators of soil solution. The effect of sulfate on the mobility and bioavailability of Cd was examined. The results showed that flooded environment played an important role in affecting the mobility of Cd in soil solution, the availability of cadmium in the soil increased firstly and then decreased. Long-term flooding could increase the pH of the soil and reduce the conductivity of the soil. The content of cadmium in alkaline soil was generally lower than that in acid soil during the first three months, and the content of cadmium in acid soil after flooding and adding sulfate is effectively reduced to the same level as alkaline soil at the fourth month. The addition of sulfate reduced the availability of cadmium in alkaline soil, which is on the contrary in acid soils. After comparison, flooding conditions played a greater role in reducing the cadmium content in soil solution than the addition of sulfate. The mechanism behind these phenomena needs to be further explored.

Lia a College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, PR.China para@cau.edu.cn Soil environmental quality standard (GB 15618-2018) in China has made restrictions on heavy metal contents for agricultural land. The risk screening values and intervention values are divided into four segments according to soil pH. However it is still unreasonable to evaluate the safety of agricultural production under some cases relying on the standards, due to the complexity of soil properties and the differences of the absorption of heavy metals by vegetables. This study chose nationwide vegetables and corresponding cultivated soils as research objects to explore the difference of absorption and enrichment characteristics of heavy metals in different vegetables. It integrated 977 sample groups in all through literature search and sample collection. Also the cadmium (Cd) soil-plant transport model was established to the safe production threshold for vegetables in the soil. The results showed that the contents of eight heavy metals in vegetables conformed to positive skewed distribution. The median values of Cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), arsenic (As), chromium (Cr), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and nickel (Ni) content were 0.62 mg/kg, 2.29 mg/kg, 0.66 mg/kg, 1.05 mg/kg, 0.05 mg/kg, 6.17 mg/kg, 25.35 mg/kg, and 0.11 mg/kg, respectively. The Pb, Cd, Hg, As and Cr content in edible parts of vegetables had exceeded the standards to varying degrees, according to the limits made in food contaminant standard (GB 2762-2017). Lead had the highest exceeding rate. The bioconcentration factors (BCF) of heavy metals in different kinds of vegetables distributed in log normal mostly. Among the five toxic elements, vegetables showed the highest enrichment level of Cd and BCF of Cd ranged from 0.001 to 25. The Cd BCF geometric mean of leafy, root, fruit and leguminous vegetables was about 9-68, 4-25, 3-37, 4-28 times respectively compared to other elements. Therefor the enrichment ability of vegetables to elements could be quite different. Among different kinds of vegetables, leafy and root vegetables had stronger enrichment ability. Leafy vegetables were more likely to absorb Cd and Ni while root vegetables enriched Pb, Zn, Cu and Cr more easily. This study established the prediction equations for Cd transfer of leafy and fruit vegetables in the soil-plant system. It concluded that Cd content in edible parts was positively correlated with Cd content in soil. The soil total Cd explained 55%、76.86%、16.87% and 51.8% of Cd content variance in leafy, root, fruit and leguminous vegetables, respectively.

The close relationship food-land, stemming from socio-cultural factors and availability of local resources, has weakened over time due to globalization, leading to a conformity of eating habits in all regions. Consumers have shown renewed interest in the geographical provenience of agro-food products, as result of the reduction of confidence in the quality and safety of food produced outside their region, country or even continent. In this context, since 1993, the EU has had a system in place for Protected Geographical Indications (PGI). In Italy, where the cultivation of lemon is widely diffused in the south, the “Limone di Sorrento” (Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f. cv “Ovale di Sorrento”) has been awarded as PGI (with an annual production of about 1092 tons recorded in 2017) recognizing its quality and ancient cultural characteristics of cultivation on terraces overlooking the sea of the Sorrento peninsula. Moreover, the Limone di Sorrento is known all over the world being the raw material for the production of the famous “Limoncello di Sorrento” liqueur. Our study is aimed to apply various analytical methods to assess geographical origin and authenticity of Sorrento lemon fruits to protect them from frauds with lemons of other geographical origin. This work reports the content of 16 trace elements, measured by acid digestion plus ICP-MS, in lemon juices of “Ovale di Sorrento” collected from three different production areas of Campania Region and tests the efficacy and robustness of a chemometric approach of geographic traceability to discriminate the elemental profiles of “Limone di Sorrento” PGI. The best model, achieving 100% of correct reclassification, was based on 12 elements (Ti, V, Fe, Mn, Co, Cu, Zn, Se, Rb, Sr, Mo, Ba) showing an optimal discrimination between the 3 lemon groups with different geographical provenience. The model was cross-validated with satisfactory results (97,5% of correct reclassification). The elemental profiles of lemons at different stages of maturity were assessed. The application of the model not only for tracing the geographical provenience of lemon fruits but also for protecting them from frauds (PGI and NO-PGI) is highlighted. The relationship with the elemental compositions and characteristics of related soils is also under investigation.

Remediation of heavy metal contaminated soil is an expensive process, and awareness of different factors controlling the levels of risk is needed to improve risk assessments and inform remediation efforts. The residence time of contaminants in soil or ‘ageing’ (e.g. metals and metalloids) is a factor which generally influences the bioavailability and toxicity of soil-borne contaminants. Despite As being an important terrestrial contaminant, the effect of As ageing on phytotoxicity has received relatively little research. To assess the influence of ageing on As phytotoxicity, a standard test was conducted to compare the growth rate of Cucumis sativus L. (cucumber) in with contaminated soil aged for up to 5 years. Nine different soils with different characteristics were collected from different states of Australia. Soils were spiked with different concentrations of As to induce a dose-response curve. Soils were incubated under aerobic conditions for 0.25 yr for the first As toxicity test and 5 yr for the second test. Cucumber plants were grown for 28 days in both experiments and effective As concentration that inhibits cucumber growth by 10%, and 50% were compared to calculate the impact of ageing on As phytotoxicity. Ageing for 5 yr significantly reduced As phytotoxicity relative to soils aged for 0.25 yr by 1.4 to 2.7 fold when expressed on a total As basis. In one soil there was no increase in EC50 values from ageing from 0.25 to 5 yr. For the dataset as a whole, ageing from between 0.25 and 5 yr increased the EC50 values by 1.6 fold. The relatively limited influence of ageing between the two periods of the current study may indicate that the first three months are most influential for the ageing of soil-borne As.

Here, we explore Cd toxicity and the mechanism of Cd detoxification in rice. We isolated a cadmium (Cd)-tolerant mutant of rice, named cdt1, from an EMS-mutagenized population of an Indica rice cultivar widely grown in China. At 2 µM Cd, the elongation of the primary roots was inhibited by 79% in the mutant, compared with 96% in wild type. There was no significant difference in Cd uptake between the mutant and wild type. Using genomic resequencing and complementation, OsSHM4 was identified as the causal gene for the mutant phenotype, which encodes a putative serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHM). The OsSHM4 protein was localized to the nucleus and OsSHM4 gene was expressed in all roots and shoots. OsSHM4 mutation resulted in higher sulphur and selenium accumulation in the shoots and rice grain. Under field conditions, the brown rice of the mutant contained 83 – 92% higher Se concentration than wild type. Transcriptomic analysis showed a significantly higher transcript level of the high-affinity sulphate transporter gene OsSULTR1;1 in the mutant roots. Thiol compounds including cysteine, glutathione and phytochelatins were significantly increased in both roots and shoots of cdt1. Growth and grain biomass were not affected. These results indicate that the nuclear localised OsSHM4 plays an important role in regulating sulphur homeostasis. Its mutation results in increased Cd tolerance and enrichment of selenium in the rice grain.

Some authors have argued that Boron deficiency or sub-optimal content of this essential element could trigger the outbreak of symptoms. This hypothesis was supported by experiments carried out in hydroponics, where GPGV symptoms were evident only when grapevines were grown in boron-limited solutions. We hypothesized that a high content of B in the vine could suppress the symptoms and thus negative effects of GPGV in vineyard. We also wanted to check whether toxic effects could occur when exceeding maximum recommended dose of B per hectare by foliar spray. To test efficacy of B fertilization in increasing B content in vines, an agronomic trial (3 randomized blocks) was set-up in a vineyard grown with “Friulano” cultivar, located in “Villanova” Farm, (Farra d’Isonzo, Northeastern Italy; 45°54’59,5” N; 13°31’51,5” E) in 2018. Treatments were four: 1- control; 2- soil B fertilization (2 times); 3-foliar B fertilization (10 times), 4- foliar (10 times) plus soil (2 times) B fertilization; in all cases B was supplied as a complex with ethanolamine. Before each foliar administration, and after the last one, 5 leaves were sampled from each plot and analysed for their B content as well as for other mineral nutrients (Ca, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, P and Zn). Soil samples were taken for B quantitation before each fertilization and after second fertilization. Buds were taken in early November (one bud per vine) to be analysed as for the leaves. Foliar treatments (3 and 4) promptly increased boron content in leaves compared to control; by contrast foliar B concentration increased slightly when this element was added to soil (treatment 2). B concentration in buds taken from soil only fertilization (treatment 2) was not different from control; foliar treatments (3 and 4) were both statistically higher compared to control and not statistically different among them. No visual reduction of GPGV symptoms were noticed during the season as a consequence of any B fertilization treatment. However, because B reserves in plant are important at sprouting, both visual and B content monitoring will be performed in 2019 growing season.

Elucidating the interfacial processes of trace metals from real contaminated soil to plants including wild plants and rice within the rhizosphere can provide important information on metal biogeochemistry and food safety. The current study aims to explore the spatial distribution and molecular speciation of Cu from soil rhizosphere to plants including indigenous plant species and rice collected from mining-impacted field sites, and reveal the possible uptake mechanisms. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis indicated that Cu was primarily associated with iron oxide and sulfide in soil with a minor proportion of organic complexed species. With plant growth, the Cu-oxalate like organic species in rhizosphere soil significantly increased, with a corresponding decrease in Cu-goethite. Synchrotron-based micro-X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) microscopy and X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) analysis indicated that most Cu was sequestered around the root surface/epidermis, primarily forming Cu alginate-like species as a Cu-tolerance mechanism for both indigenous plant M. floridulus and rice root. From the root epidermis to the cortex and vascular bundle, more thiol-S bound Cu(I) complex was observed, representing the reduced product of Cu(II) by thiol-S ligand in the root. The absorbed Cu was probably transported from the root to the aerial part as Cu-histidine complex, which was observed in the root xylem. In conclusion, the large retention capacity and reduction of Cu(II) in plant roots alleviated Cu toxicity to plants, which was beneficial for phytostabilizing Cu underground and lowering Cu accumulation in rice grains. These findings showed detailed Cu uptake mechanisms in plants from field contaminated sites, which shed lights on the Cu detoxification process and potential remediation strategies.

Maize plants were analysed for Zn, Pb, Cd and Cr concentrations at one and two month(s) after planting (i.e 1MAP, 2MAP) and at harvesting. Results showed that maize plant accumulated more Pb than other metals while Cr was least accumulated and was only detected in the root of the harvested maize plants. Control plants had the highest concentrations of all these metals at 1MAP and 2MAP compared to compost treatments. The metal concentration in the root was generally higher than that of the shoot. Though, there was no plant from the control plots, but MSC compost application reduced the Pb concentration in maize seeds; MSC20 (152 mg/kg) and MSC40 (174 mg/kg), compared to CPC treatments. Unlike what was observed for the Pb distribution, Cd concentrations in the leaves of maize crops from compost treatments (MSC20, MSC40 and CPC40) were more than those of the roots, though reduced at 2MAP. Zinc mobility to the leaf at IMAP was lower than that of 2MAP, especially in the MSC compost treatments.

Rice is an important staple food for approximately half of the world’s populations and for people who depend on rice as a dietary staple, it has been shown to be potentially a major source of cadmium intake.

In humans, Mo is required for the biosynthesis of molybdenum cofactor (Moco), which forms the active site of molybdenum-requiring enzymes (molybdoenzymes) including aldehyde oxidase, xanthine dehydrogenase, sulfite oxidase and amidoxime reducing component. These enzymes participate in crucial processes such as purine metabolism and sulfite detoxification and play a vital role in maintaining human healt. Deficiency of Moco biosynthesis in humans results in the decrease of molybdoenzyme activity, which leads to inheritable progressive neurological damage and even early childhood death. However, little is known about the genetic basis of the variation in Mo content in rice (Oryza sativa L.) grain. We mapped a quantitative trait locus (QTL) qGMo8 that controls Mo accumulation in rice grain by using a recombinant inbred line population and a backcross introgression line population. We identified a molybdate transporter, OsMOT1;1, as the causal gene for this QTL. OsMOT1;1 exhibits transport activity for molybdate, but not sulfate, when heterogeneously expressed in yeast cells. OsMOT1;1 is mainly expressed in roots and is involved in the uptake and translocation of molybdate under molybdate limited condition. Knock-down of OsMOT1;1 results in less Mo being translocated to shoots, lower Mo concentration in grains and higher sensitivity to Mo deficiency. We reveal that the natural variation of Mo concentration in rice grains is attributed to the variable expression of OsMOT1;1 due to sequence variation in its promoter. Identification of natural allelic variation in OsMOT1;1 may facilitate the development of rice varieties with Mo enriched grain for dietary needs and improve Mo nutrition of rice on Mo-deficient soils.

Low pH and low phosphate concentration enhanced wheat uptake of As, resulting in high As toxicity. The As(V)-tolerant cultivar MM45 exhibited higher relative root elongation than non-tolerant cultivar HM29 in all treatments, except that no genotypic difference was recorded for the solution P at 100 µmol L–1 or greater. Wheat seedling As(V) tolerance was positively correlated with P concentration in roots and shoots. In short-term (30 min) As(V)-uptake kinetics experiments, the maximum influx rate (Vmax) of As(V) increased with decreasing solution pH (from 7.0 to 6.0). Compared with HM29, although MM45 had lower Vmax , its Michaelis–Menten constant (Km) did not exceed that of HM29 in any of the treatments. The Vmax values of both cultivars were not significantly affected by phosphate treatments, except for HM29 which had significantly higher Vmax value in the presence of phosphate at pH 7.0. The Km values of the two cultivars increased by 9- to 20-fold when phosphate was present as opposed to absent from the uptake solution. This study showed that the Vmax values are mainly increased by high pH and As(V) uptake Km is mainly increased by phosphate presence. Decreased As(V) influx rates during early stages and increased P concentration in plant tissues are associated with increased As tolerance in wheat seedlings.

Here, the hydroponically grown rice seedings exposed to Cd treatment in the presence or absence of Si NPs were characterized. The results showed that the presence of SiNPs alleviated Cd stress and restrained the translocation of Cd from roots to shoots. The morphological results showed that dramatic damage and severe structural changes in the root cells occurred in the absence of SiNPs, whereas the presence of SiNPs remained nearly intact cell structure of rice roots even in the presence of high concentrations of Cd. The subcellular distribution results showed that Cd content in cell wall of rice roots increased, and its concentration in cell organelle and soluble fractions decreased at SiNPs treatments, indicating that Cd was blocked in the cell wall by SiNPs. In addition, SiNPs alleviated the oxidative damage to rice roots, decreased the expression of genes involved in Cd uptake (OsNramp1 and OsNramp5) and activated the expression of genes involved in Cd transport into vacuoles (OsHMA3). This study provided a molecular-scale insight into the understanding of the SiNPs-reduced Cd uptake into rice.

Previously, we reported that D. linearis accumulates high concentration of aluminium (Al) and silicon (Si) in the fronds, but the interactions between these elements and REEs are unknown. In this study, a range of analytical techniques, including extractions, Scanning-Electron Microscopy with Energy-Dispersive Spectroscopy (SEM-EDS) and Particle Induced X-Ray Emission (PIXE) were used to study the associations of REEs with Al and Si. The results showed that D. linearis accumulated high concentrations of REEs (up to 3830 mg kg-1), Al (up to 9660 mg kg-1) and Si (up to 20 300 mg kg-1), with concentrations increasing with the age and the frond order of the pinna. The PIXE analysis revealed that REEs (e.g. La & Ce) were highly concentrated within the veins and necrosis of the pinnules, which were probably induced by manganese toxicity. While Al and Si were more concentrated at the margins of the pinnules. The PIXE analysis also revealed that REEs, Al and Si were co-localized at the xylem and pericycle (cell walls) of the stolon, petiole and midvein cross-sections, the epidermis especially the upper epidermis of the pinnule cross-section. The extraction patterns suggested the existence of REEs-Si and Al-Si complexes in the fronds. The SEM-EDS analysis confirmed the existence of aluminosilicate deposits in the protoplast and apoplast of the pinna cells, and cell walls of the pericycles of the vascular system. We speculate that REEs, Al and Si were co-existing within the solutes of the transpiration flow, and then, some of which were carried to the blades and co-deposited at the epidermis and necrosis, and some that did not translocate out were co-deposited at the pericycle. Overall, our results show that REEs/Al-Si co-depositions are involved in detoxifying the excess REEs and Al in D. linearis frond.

Hydroponic experiments were performed in this study to investigate the effects of selenite or selenate on the Cd subcellular distribution and xylem transport in rice seedlings (Oryza sativa L.) under Cd stress. The antioxidative defense responses in rice plants were also assayed. Results showed that the supplementation of both Se forms decreased the Cd accumulations in rice roots and shoots. Selenite addition significantly decreased the Cd contents in different subcellular fractions of rice roots, while increased the proportion of Cd distributed to soluble cytosol by 23.41%, and decreased the Cd distribution in organelle by 28.74% by contrast to the Cd-alone treatment. As for selenate addition, only the Cd distribution ratio of cytosol was increased by 13.07%. Furthermore, 55.86% decrease of Cd concentration in xylem sap was displayed when adding selenite, while little change was found in rice plants exposed to the treatment co-applied with selenate.

Due to the limited information known about Ga and In contaminants, previous research has evaluated their possible risk and toxicity to rice seedlings. It was surprised to observe a differential physiological response to Ga and In: the beneficial effect on the growth of rice seedlings was found while applying low Ga concentrations (less than 10 ppm); on the contrary, the In treated seedlings (higher than 0.08ppm) displayed growth inhibition, such as shorter root length. To elucidate their difference on the regulatory mechanism, this study first compared the gene expression between Ga- or In- treated plants using whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-sequencing).

Results showed revealed that the B. napusnatural population exhibited a broad variation of Pb tolerance, as the relative radicle length (RRL) were range from 12.17 to 123.65. And then six Pb-tolerant genotypes were selected for potential phytoremediation based on the criterion of RRL >85% in the population.

In these way, nine candidate genes including GSTUs, BCATs, UBP13, TBRand HIPP01, located in four QTLs were identified to be associated with Pb tolerance. Furthermore, most of these genes were expressed significantly higher in Pb-tolerant genotypes than in Pb-sensitive genotypes and it were mostly induced by Pb stress in Pb-tolerant accessions. Theae nine candidate genes which might contribute to Pb tolerance by regulating glutathione metabolism, amino acid metabolism, ubiquitination, and cell wall development were identified in B. napus.

Most Southeast Asian countries are dependent on As-contaminated groundwater for drinking and irrigation purposes, leading the latter to the contamination of agricultural soils as well. Rice (Oryza sativa L.), which is strongly susceptible to accumulate As in its grains, is a staple food for more than half of the world’s population, and many of the rice producing countries suffer from As contamination in their groundwater or soil. Arsenic can be found in both inorganic (arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V))) and organic (methylated) forms in anaerobic and aerobic soil/water environments. Arsenic uptake by plants is mainly as As(V), but, in flooded paddy soils As(III), which is assumed to be more toxic than As(V), is normally the predominant species. Therefore, the culture of rice under oxidizing aerobic conditions has been recommended in fields suffering from As contamination. Chemical analogy with phosphate and binding to thiol-rich peptides, gives As(V) and As(III), respectively, its potential to be toxic. Arsenate toxicity, as well as other heavy metals or environmental stresses, has been proved to stimulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation and lead to oxidative stress. But there is still not enough information about the relationships between As accumulation and plant oxidative stress. A hydroponics study was carried out to evaluate the effects of increasing As concentrations on oxidative stress parameters in rice plants grown in optimized hydroponic conditions. The aim was to obtain prediction equations which may help to foresee rice behavior and tolerance and phytotoxicity thresholds. A preliminary hydroponic experiment was carried out in order to stablish the most favorable conditions for plant growth, using a fixed arsenate dose (1 mg L-1) and different pH and DOC concentrations were tested. Then, in the main experiment, rice plants were exposed to increasing As doses (0-10 mg L-1) at pH 6.0 and 100 mg L-1 DOC. Rice plants were harvested after 21 days of treatment exposure. Trace element and nutrient concentrations in the plants were determined (ICP-OES) after microwave assisted acid digestion. Arsenic major species were analyzed using HPLC-AFS in PBS sample extracts. Rice leaves were also assessed for oxidative stress through lipid peroxidation (MDA) and protein oxidation (carbonyl proteins) determinations. Plant yield (shoot and root length and dry weights) decreased strongly with As concentrations above 2.5 mg L-1. Arsenic concentrations increased with As dose in plant shoots and roots, showing higher accumulation in the roots, except in the highest doses (5 and 10 mg L-1) where As concentrations in below and above parts were similar. Moreover, As(V) accumulation was higher in the aerial parts and As(III) in the roots. Lipid peroxidation (MDA concentration) increased with As dose and appeared to be related to As(V) concentrations in the roots. Carbonylated proteins increased also with As dose, but were related to Cu and As(III) concentrations in the aerial part of the plants. These results may help to establish As toxicity thresholds and will be of interest for future studies regarding As accumulation and oxidative stress/toxic effects in rice plants.

Shapiroc a Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Sustainable Intensification, Department of Agronomy, Kansas State University, USA b Department of Crop Physiology, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, India c Department of Agronomy and Horticulture, University of Nebraska, USA zachstewart@ksu.edu Recently, a “modified one health” approach has emerged aiming to expand the original “one health” concept from animal and human health to include soil and plant health. This is a needed shift that brings attention to the importance of the health of the entire food production system for human health. Nearly all nutrients composing food originated through farming systems from soil to plants to grain and either directly to humans or indirectly from animals to humans. Thus, the way in which we manage any component in this farming system not only effects the quantity of the food that we consume but also the quality. However, this principle is often contentious and over simplified to imply that increasing the nutrient content in the soil will increase the nutrient content in the plant, grain, and ultimately the nutrient status of the human population that consumes food from this system. This is rarely the case. There are numerous chemical and biological interactions that confound these interactions and should be investigated. In 2013 and 2014, 87 maize fields in the Great Plains of the United States were surveyed and sampled for nutrient status of the soil (0-20 cm), plant (VT-R3), and grain (physiological maturity) and their relationship to grain yield. All samples were collected within a 15 x 10 m area in maize fields having no known yield limiting constraints. Soil and plant samples were collected at the same time. Agronomic standard extractants and detection methods were used for soil, plant, and grain nutrients analyses. Pearson’s correlation coefficients were calculated for each chemical relationship (i.e. plant x plant, plant x soil, plant x grain, soil x soil, soil x grain, grain x grain) and correlated with yield. For the purposes of this paper, we will primarily focus on the Zn and Fe results. Soil NO3, P, B, Cu, Fe, and Zn did not have significant positive correlations with their nutrient concentrations in plant tissue. All grain nutrient concentrations and grain protein concentration had negative correlations with grain yield, though there was a strong positive correlation of grain nutrient uptake with grain yield. As yield increased, grain K, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn and protein concentrations decreased while total grain nutrient content increased. Plant nutrient concentrations had little correlation with the corresponding nutrient concentrations in grain, however, soil nutrient status of P, K, S, and Zn each had significant positive correlations with their corresponding nutrient concentration in grain. Though these relationships are likely not universal across different locations with different soil types, plant species, management practices and other biogeochemical conditions, these results highlight the complex interactions connecting the nutrient status of soil, plant and grains. Additionally, these results highlight the need for greater consideration of yield and grain nutrient interactions. Though total grain nutrient content increased with increasing yield, grain nutrient concentration declined with increasing yield, which is of greater concern for human health. Grain nutrient concentration drives human nutrient consumption– not grain nutrient content. Further research should be conducted to quantify these relationships between soil, plant, grain and grain yield.

Food production has increased and needs to increase further, but undernutrition of micronutrients (e.g. iron, zinc, selenium) and other essential components of diets is also occurring. The high prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies (MNDs) is a huge development challenge. For example, deficiencies of Fe and Zn caused the loss of 862,000 and 117,000 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) in Ethiopia in 2013, or 5.4% of total disease burdens. Biofortification efforts using agronomic and genetic approaches for crop and human nutrition can help boost micronutrients in diets, but our hypothesis is that their success is affected by soil conditions which affect micronutrient bioavailability. It is therefore important to identify the factors that affect micronutrient supply and to use the understanding it to determine the limiting factors for nutrient supply. However, many plant-based genetic approaches pay little consideration to the environmental, and particularly soil aspects of bioavailability. We have developed the concept of GeoNutrition, defined as how soil conditions affect the nutrient content of smallholder-grown crops, and consequently diets and human biomarkers of nutrient status. In order to assess GeoNutrition, data and soils, climate, crop composition, dietary intakes and human micronutrient status all need to be collected in areas of interest. This is now possible using rapid methods for collecting and analyzing multivariate data and establishing the relationships between these different data layers. A number of research projects are now active in GeoNutrition, which concentrate on developing soil-crop relationships and “hidden hunger” of micronutrients. We have shown that human MND risks are widespread and linked to soil type. For example, biomarker and food supply data show that selenium (Se) and Zn deficiency risks exceed dietary iron (Fe) deficiency risks for many groups. From collaborative research in Malawi, evidence that human Se and Zn deficiency is linked to soil type was obtained from: (1) soil and maize grain surveys; (2) cross-sectional studies on intakes and status from contrasting soil types; (3) continental-scale food systems analysis; (4) human biomarkers of status such as plasma Se concentrations. Work on selenium and zinc mapping and prediction in Ethiopia and Malawi are ongoing in BBSRC and BMGF-funded projects, as a prelude to dietary intake studies, as well as biofortification trials and intervention studies. The latter will entail households receiving Zn-biofortified flour, Se-biofortified flour, or non-biofortified control flour.

Currently 36.5% of Indian soils suffer from Zn deficiency which might further escalate to 51.2% if soils under marginal deficiencies are brought under intensive cultivation. Zinc deficiency in soils does not only reduce crop productivity, but it also leads to low-Zn food causing human malnutrition. The problem is global; however, it is more acute in India as billions of people suffer from Zn malnutrition. Objective: To bio-fortify rice grain with Zn through Zn fertilization to tackle Zn malnutrition. Methods: Effectiveness of rice crop to be biofortified through foliar applications of ZnSO4. 7H2O at boot and milk stages and basal Zn application at the time of sowing was investigated under field conditions at 25 sites years of Northern India. The concentration of Zn in harvested whole grains was determined by AAS. Results & Discussion: Foliar spray of Zn fertilizer increased grain Zn concentration from 21 to 62% and 20 to 61% over no Zn across all sites during 2015 and 2016, respectively. A pooled cluster analysis data showed significant mean increase in grain Zn concentration with foliar spray of Zn (27.5 mg kg-1) than with no Zn (19.8 mg kg-1). Grain yield of wheat varied across years and among the selected field locations. Soil Zn addition gave higher grain yield followed by foliar Zn as compared to no Zn treatment. Foliar spray of Zn produced the highest agronomic efficiency, Zn use efficiency apparent recovery of Zn and utilization efficiency as compared to soil Zn application.

Therefore, it is important to study the distribution and bioavailability of mineral nutrients in the wheat grains. Based on Nano-XRF (X-ray fluorescence mapping with the nano-sized spatial resolution) imaging technology, this study characterized the distribution of vital elements, such as zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), calcium(Ca), sulfur (S), phosphorus (P) etc., in the wheat grain during the period of development at cellular and subcellular levels. Detailed images of a large amount of nutrient storage were shown directly in the scutellum. While some specific elements, such as Zn, was sequestrated in the embryo. Moreover, the granular accumulation patterns of micronutrients such as Zn, Fe and manganese (Mn) were demonstrated as phytates in the aleurone layer, explaining the limited mobility of them; Ca also existed in the starchy endosperm as hot spots, which were possibly presented as calcium oxalate. These results indicated that the immobilization of intracellular metals affected the bioavailability.

Wheat is one of the most important staple food crops, and the major source for human Zn nutrition. Dryland is almost the main wheat production area in the world, but usually suffers from the low soil Zn availability due to the high soil pH, the high soil carbonate contents, and the frequent drought stress. Therefore, optimizing cultivar, fertilizer and soil nutrient management is urgently needed for stabilizing and increasing the wheat grain yield and simultaneously the grain Zn concentration on calcareous soil in dryland. In a three year field studies, cultivars with high grain yield were selected from 123 wheat cultivars, and the variation of their grain Zn concentration, reasons for high grain Zn concentration at high yield levels and the potential for increasing the grain Zn concentration were evaluated and explored. An in farm investigation together with soil and plant sampling was carried out in 9 different sites of three provinces in dryland wheat production areas in China from 2015-2018, to study the farmer’s wheat yield and the grain micronutrient concentration differences, and explore the grain Zn concentration difference at higher yield levels. Also, samples were collected from a long term location-fixed field experiment initiated in 2004, to explore the change of wheat grain yield and its Zn concentration and soil available macro- and micro-nutrients affected by nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) application rates, for the purpose to understand the right N and P application rates, corresponding soil available N, P and Zn nutrients for a higher grain yield and higher grain Zn concentration. Obtained results showed that, for high yielding cultivars, those with high grain Zn concentration also showed high shoot and grain Zn uptakes and high Zn harvest indexes. Analysis of straw Zn concentration showed that it varied from 1.2 to 10.5 mg kg-1. Based on the established model between grain Zn and straw Zn, and assumed that the straw Zn of the high-yielding cultivars could be decreased to a lower level around 1.5 mg kg-1, their grain Zn concentrations would be able to increase to 40.0 mg kg-1. Results from the in farm investigation showed that, wheat grain Zn concentration varied from 12.2 to 48.0 mg kg-1 for high-yielding farmers, and the soil available N was higher and available P was lower for the high grain Zn samples. Higher soil available potassium (K) and lower soil available ferrum (Fe) were also found beneficial for improving grain Zn concentration. The long term field experiment showed that each 100 kg P2O5 ha-1 increase of P application rate could led to a decrease of wheat grain Zn by 9.2 mg kg-1, and for balancing the wheat grain yield and its Zn concentration in dryland with calcareous soil and soil available Zn of 4.6 mg kg-1, the N and P fertilizer rates should be maintained respectively at 160.0 kg N ha-1 and 95.0 kg P2O5 ha-1, when the grain yield is around 6000 kg ha-1, its Zn concentration is at a relatively high level of 32.0 mg kg-1, and soil available N and P are around 6.5 mg kg-1 and 12.0 mg kg-1, respectively at sowing. Our results showed the possibility for improving wheat grain Zn concentration by enhancing the Zn uptake from soil and its translocation from straw to grain by new cultivar breeding and selection, and by optimizing the soil N, P, Fe and Zn as well as the N and P fertilizer management in similar areas of calcareous soil and dryland climate in the world.

Email: ivyligowe@gmail.com Prevalence of iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) in Sub-Saharan countries is related to low soil iodine content. To combat IDD salt iodisation has been adopted by many countries. However, this approach is affected by losses during cooking and storage of salt. Furthermore, availability of iodised salt depends on the socio-economic status of communities. Agronomic bio-fortification of food crops may be an alternative way to increase iodine status in populations. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of iodine bio-fortification in tropical soils with contrasting chemistry and fertility; soils included an oxisol (pH = 4.2), an alfisol (pH = 5.8) and a vertisol (pH = 8.4). Three levels of sodium iodide (NaI) were assessed (0, 5 and 10 kg ha-1), using both foliar and soil application methods. The leafy vegetables tested were Brassica napus L and Amaranthus retroflexus L grown in an RCBD factorial experiment replicated four times. Leaf samples were collected fortnightly, starting from 14 days after iodine application, on five occasions. Iodine concentration and uptake showed a sharp drop > 60 % and > 80 % in A. retroflexus and B. napus by 28 days after iodine application in all soil types and both iodine levels and application methods. The drop in iodine concentration and uptake might be because of iodine fixation in the soil, depletion and immobility within the folia applied plant. Soil application method was more efficient in vertisols while foliar application was observed to be more effective in all soil types. Iodine bio-fortification was therefore observed to increase iodine concentration, uptake by green vegetables and intake by humans and could be a way to reduce IDD in tropical regions. Biofortification of green vegetables which are subject to multiple harvests requires repeated application and this may raise logistical difficulties for smallholder farmers.

We determined baseline soil availability of zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) and the effects of soil type and farmer management on extractable soil Zn and Fe and subsequent concentration in cereal and legume grains under two contrasting agro-ecologies in Zimbabwe. Soil and crop surveys were conducted in Hwedza and Mutasa Districts of Zimbabwe in 2015-16 on 350 farms over different soil types and sampling within farms on fields with different levels of productivity (designated as “most” and “least” productive fields), using an inherited hierarchical randomized sampling design. Grain Zn and Fe concentration in maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), finger millet (Eleusine coracana) and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) were insufficient for adequate human nutrition. The Linear Mixed Effects (LME) model revealed that diethylene triamine penta-acetic acid- (DTPA) extractable soil Zn concentration and grain Zn concentration were largely affected by field productivity level. DTPA-extractable soil Zn concentration was more than double on most productive fields (mean 0.8 mg kg-1) than least productive fields and translated to up to 42.4 mg grain Zn kg-1. An interaction effect of field productivity level and total soil Zn concentration on DTPA-extractable soil Zn concentration suggests potential contribution of organic matter management to unlocking unavailable forms of soil Zn. DTPA-extractable soil Fe and grain Fe concentration were largely affected by soil type and crop type, respectively. In Hwedza, clay soils had larger DTPA-extractable Fe concentration of 16.0 mg kg-1 while sandy soils had DTPA-extractable soil Fe concentration of 12.6 mg kg-1. The LME modelling approach reveals soil geochemical covariates affecting DTPA-extractable soil Zn and Fe concentration and grain Zn and Fe concentration within Districts. Future studies can therefore be powered to detect their roles at wider spatial scales for sustainable management of crop Zn and Fe nutrition.

Maintaining adequate micronutrient concentrations in maize grains is of great importance for food quality and human health. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution and bioavailability of micronutrients in soils and maize grains in major crop production areas in China, where knowledge is limited, and further to identify the main environmental factors affecting micronutrient concentrations in maize grains. Totally, 995 maize grain and soil samples from famers’ field were collected in 2017 from 202 counties in four major maize agro-climatic regions of China. Information on grain yield and cultivation management were also collected for each field. Concentrations of Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu in grain and soil properties including pH, total N, Olsen-P, available K, organic matter, and concentrations of DTPA-extractable Fe, Zn, Mn and Cu Were determined. Concentrations of DTPA-extractable micronutrients varied greatly with maize production areas, being higher for soils in southwest of China which were acid soils with high organic matter content. Analyses of variance across different areas revealed significant genotypic and environmental effects for grain micronutrient concentrations and grain yield. Average micronutrient concentrations in maize grain were 17.3 mg kg-1 (range 5.0-51.7) for Fe, 17.4 mg kg-1 (range 6.2-35.1) for Zn, 1.49 mg kg-1 (range 0.07-4.66) for Mn and 4.86 mg kg-1 (range 1.90-10.50) for Cu, respectively. Compared to the biofortification target values of 60 mg kg-1 for Fe and 38 mg kg-1 for Zn, all samples were considered inadequate to meet dietary requirement for human. Grain Fe and Zn concentrations correlated significantly and negatively with grain yield, and positively with growing degree days (GDD) and soil DTPA-Fe and DTPA-Zn, respectively. The significantly positive correlation between Zn and Fe concentrations suggest good prospects of simultaneous improvement for both micronutrients. Our study provided the current status of bioavailability of micronutrients in soil and maize grains in China. Quantifying the effect of environmental factors on concentrations and bioavailability of micronutrients in maize grains should be addressed in future research.

Soil Zn application is a feasible approach to quickly and effectively increase grain Zn concentration of wheat and maize, thereby benefit human health. However, the effect of continuous soil Zn application on the health risk of heavy metals is still unclear. To quantify the effects of continuous soil Zn application on the potential health benefit and health risk of heavy metals, a field experiment with six Zn rates (0, 2.3, 5.7, 11.4, 22.7 and 34.1 kg Zn ha-1) was conducted in a winter wheat-summer maize rotation system from 2009 in Quzhou county, Hebei province. The health benefit (disability-adjusted life years , DALYs saved) of Zn and the human risk of heavy metals in wheat and maize grains were quantitatively assessed after 8 years’ soil Zn application. Results showed that both grain Zn concentration and Zn bioavailability of wheat and maize were significantly increased as Zn rate increased. Meanwhile, the wheat and maize grain in the treatments which had received fertilizer Zn application have decreased by 8%-28% of current health burden in optimistic scenario and 3%-9% in pessimistic scenario. The health risk index (HRI) of Zn was significantly increased whereas that of arsenic (As) and manganese (Mn) were decreased in response to the increase of Zn concentration in wheat and maize grains. The HRI of lead (Pb) and cadmium (Cd) were significantly increased in wheat grain while decreased in maize grain. The hazard indexes of wheat and maize were not affected by Zn application rates. The target cancer risk indexes of As in wheat and maize grain were significantly decreased with the increase of Zn rates. In conclusion, Zn application can benefit human health without increasing the risk of heavy metals. This study comprehensively evaluated the effect of Zn fertilizer application on human health and highlighted its particular importance in agricultural production.

The estimated risk of mineral deficiencies in Africa is highest for Ca, Zn, Se, and I. A Se status assessment survey in the rural central Kenya highlands recently conducted by our research group revealed a high risk of dietary Se deficiency at 87% among under-5 children and 97% among women. Effective strategies are needed to reach these rural communities whose diets depend on subsistence farming. Therefore, this study investigated maize and bean crops’ response to Se fertilization in the central Kenya highlands. The experiment comprises of a soil and foliar Se fertilizer application, based on control, 5, 10, and 20 g Se ha-1 treatments. The effect of combining Se fertilizer with P and N fertilizers, on Se concentration in grains is evaluated. A full factorial experiment explores further the effect of combining Se fertilizer with Zn and I fertilizers, on Se concentration in the grains. Soil fertilizer application was conducted before sowing and foliar fertilizer application during crop’s stem elongation stage. Compared to the control, Se fertilizer application significantly increases Se concentration in both maize and beans, and increases linearly with increase in Se fertilizer application doses. In the soil application, Se concentration increases on average by 0.008, 0.034, and 0.059 mg kg-1 in maize grains, and by 0.057, 0.108, and 0.165 mg kg-1 in bean grains, for the 5, 10, and 20 g Se ha-1 treatments respectively. The P and N fertilizers have a positive effect on Se concentration in grains. The foliar application results in significantly higher Se concentration in grains, with Se concentration increasing on average by 0.123, 0.171, and 0.272 mg kg-1 in maize grains, and by 0.353, 0.713, and 1.173 mg kg-1 in beans. Foliar application is therefore more effective. The effect of Se fertilization varies across the study locations, and is influenced by variation in soil characteristics, weather conditions, and crop species. Crop’s response to Se fertilization is highest in Mbuyu, implying that Se fertilization has more impact in locations at higher risk of dietary Se deficiency. The study infers that, in locations at high risk of dietary Se deficiency, a foliar Se fertilizer application at 10 g Se ha-1 on beans is sufficient to improve average dietary Se intake to daily requirements among the local population. However, if only maize crops are biofortified, a foliar Se fertilizer application of 20 g ha-1 will instead be needed. In locations at lower risk of dietary Se deficiency such as Mbeu and Kiaga, soil Se fertilizer application at 10 g ha-1 on beans crops is sufficient, or foliar Se application below 5 g ha-1. Combining Se with Zn and I fertilizers does not result in significant interaction effects on Se concentration in grains. Selenium fertilizer treatment is the main variable with a significant large effect on Se concentration in the grains. There is therefore a leeway for a combined Se, Zn, and I agronomic biofortification intervention aimed at addressing the existing multi-mineral deficiencies.

Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization are common practices to harvest high crop yield, and also bring about influence on crop Zn nutrition. This review focuses on N and P fertilization on soil Zn availability and wheat Zn uptake and utilization 1) to evaluate N and P fertilization on grain Zn concentration and bioavailability, and 2) to explore the possibility of improving grain Zn nutrition by optimizing N and P management. Nitrogen fertilization increased grain Zn concentration and bioavailability. Soil Zn available increased by N fertilization, and it also enhanced root uptake, root to shoot translocation and remobilization from vegetative parts to grain, due to that various proteins and nitrogenous compounds played important roles in Zn uptake, translocation and remobilization. Phosphorus fertilization decreased grain Zn concentration and bioavailability on soil with low available P. Soil available Zn did not decrease by P fertilization when available P was lower than 34 and 200 mg kg-1 in acid and calcareous soil. At lower P rate, wheat Zn uptake also did not reduce, and even increased Zn remobilization from vegetative parts to grain resulting in grain Zn uptake increase. The decrease in grain Zn concentration was mainly ascribed to the dilution effect caused by much more grain yield increase. In China, fertilizer input is undergoing a transformation from the overuse to reasonable input. Optimal N management by decreased N fertilization rate with high grain yield might lead grain Zn decrease in Zn-deficient soil, and optimal P management was required to harvest more grain Zn with high grain yield in wheat-dominant areas. In order to harvest 40 mg kg-1 required for human health, apart from N and P management, Zn supplementation to soil or foliar should not neglect in wheat grain.

The role of biochar in crop production and soil remediation have been widely studied, however, very few attentions have been paid to whether and how biochar affects microbial communities in rhizosphere, which is an extremely important factor determining plant growth and metal bioavailability. In the present study, we analyzed the effects of biochar application on Cd uptake and accumulation in rice, and its association with specific bacteria communities in rhizosphere. The results showed that biochar application significantly reduced Cd contents in both high- and low-Cd accumulating rice cultivars, with particular efficacy for low-accumulating rice cultivars in highly contaminated soil. High-throughput sequencing analysis identified both metal-resistant and growth-promoting bacteria in the rhizosphere of biochar-treated rice plants in Cd contaminated soils. This suggests that specific bacteria were involved in the formation of a natural barrier and the transformation of metal mobilization around the rhizosphere, and to immobilize the Cd around roots of rice plants. The low-accumulating cultivar can colonize more taxa related to metal immobilization comparing to the high-accumulating cultivar. This study confirmed the role that rhizobacteria acted after biochar application, analyzed structural differences of rhizospheric colonization microbial communities among different rice cultivars, and led a better understanding of how the biochar were involved in Cd bioavailability in soils and the metal uptake by rice roots. These findings thus provide baseline data and insight toward the strategies to use biochar to reduce Cd contamination in rice grains for ensuring safer rice production.

Effects of Pb on single species of collembolans and predatory mites have been studied in some detail but Pb accumulation and biological transfer and the relationship between Pb trophic transfer and nitrogen isotope fractionation and changes in the gut microbiome through soil micro-arthropod food chains remain poorly understood. A plate system experiment was conducted to investigate the biological transfer and trophic toxicity of Pb and the effects of dietary Pb exposure on 15N in animal tissues and changes in the gut microbiome in a soil collembolan (Folsomia candida) – predatory mite (Hypoaspis aculeifer) food chain. Thirty-four- to 7-day-old F. candida were fed with wheat powder spiked with 0, 500, and 1500 μg Pb g-1 for four weeks and were then offered to 32-35 day-old H. aculeifer as prey for two weeks. Lead concentrations in tissues of both the collembolan and its predator increased with increasing total Pb in wheat. The Pb bioaccumulation factor (BAF) between predatory mites and collembolans was 1.05-1.57 and was significantly higher than that from wheat to collembolan. Diverse microbial communities were observed in both the collembolan and predator guts, consisting of (at phylum level) Proteobacteria (~77%), Bacteroidetes (~12%), Firmicutes (~4%) and Actinobacteria (~2%) in the collembolan gut and Proteobacteria (~93%) accounted for the most of the microbes in the gut of the predatory mite. The 15N fraction in the collembolan and the predatory mite was negatively correlated with the gene sequence number of COG (clusters of orthologous groups of proteins) functional categories in energy production and conversion (collembolan -0.693, mite 0.683), amino acid transport and metabolism (collembolan -0.194, mite 0.696) and defence mechanisms (collembolan -0.688, mite 0.688*). The 15N fraction in collembolan and predatory mite tissues increased significantly initially and then decreased with increasing Pb in wheat, perhaps due to the significant shift in the gut microbiome of those animals fed with Pb-contaminated food and their food intake. The key microbe (Xanthobacteraceae) that contributed to nitrogen cycling and organic matter decomposition decreased significantly in the guts of both collembolans and mites. The 15N and gut microbes in soil animals have considerable potential as biomarkers of food Pb contamination in soil food webs.

Ninety-five samples were collected from paddy and 83 samples were collected from upland. Total S content was determined by the energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence analysis (EDXRF) using 2-4 g of pressed soil pellets.

Yu and Y. Wan Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation / College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, PRC lihuafen@cau.edu.cn Selenium (Se) is an essential element for humans, whereas cadmium (Cd) is a highly toxic heavy metal to both plants and animals. Because of the different charges of Cd (Cd2+) and Se (SeO32- / SeO42-), they are taken up by plants through different channels or transporters, so they may not exhibit competition on root surface. However, numerous studies have indicated that Se can regulate Cd uptake into plants. Considering the tested plants, Se forms and different experimental conditions, the results are sometimes paradoxical. Therefore, in this study we investigated the effect of different forms of Se on Cd uptake, transportation and transformation by different plants grown in varied conditions. The concentration-dependent uptake kinetics of Cd into rice and pak choi roots were affected by Se addition. Compared with that of no Se addition, selenite slightly promoted Cd influx into rice roots, while selenate had no effect. However, both selenite and selenate remarkably enhanced Cd uptake kinetics in pak choi; the maximum Cd uptake rates increased by more than 100%. Although Se promoted the Cd influx into the roots of plants during short term exposure, Cd translocation from roots to shoots in plants was effectively reduced by Se addition with long time exposure. Se decreased Cd uptake and transportation from rice roots to shoots with prolonged exposure time, but the decreasing degree varied with both Se forms and doses. Selenite was more effective than selenate in decreasing Cd uptake and translocation. As the selenite levels in the treatment solutions increased, Cd uptake and translocation were both significantly reduced, while the inhibiting effect was more significant at lower levels of selenate. Different results were obtained from the vegetable. Regardless of the exposure time or Cd doses, selenite decreased both the translocation of Cd from pak choi roots to shoots, whereas selenate increased Cd translocation. Cd subcellular compartmentalization (namely, cell walls, organelles, and the soluble fraction), as affected by Se, was also investigated. Selenite addition significantly decreased Cd content in different subcellular fractions and organelles in rice root, while it increased the proportion of Cd distributed to soluble cytosol. When selenate was added, only the Cd distribution ratio of cytosol was increased. As for pak choi, selenite and selenate enhanced Cd sequestration by the shoot cell walls by 20% and 59%, respectively. However, Se caused opposite effects on Cd sequestration on the root cell walls; selenite enhanced it by 9%, while selenate reduced it by 22%, compared to the non-Se treatment. Generally, selenite and selenate affected Cd accumulation and translocation in plants by altering Cd subcellular distribution or other uncertain mechanisms; such effects depended on the Se forms and doses, and the tested plants.

Therefore, this study aimed to address the following questions: which food products, available on the Belgian market, contribute most significantly to the exposure of the Belgian population to Nickel through different, known contamination routes and are provoking a potential risk, i.e. chronic and acute? Therefore, different food products were purchased on the Belgian market and their nickel contents were measured, followed by statistical analysis for interpreting the data and exposure assessment. Determination of nickel in the foodstuffs was performed by a microwave-assisted acid digestion, followed by ICP-MS analysis. The Belgian food consumption survey (2014) and @Risk software were used to conduct a probabilistic exposure assessment. The highest average nickel concentrations were observed in tea, chocolate, beans, hazelnut, lentils, figs, peanut and peanut butters with average nickel contents of 6271, 4140, 2892, 2383, 1883, 1566, 1356 and 1348 μg kg-1, respectively. These products are also mainly responsible for exposure of the Belgian population to nickel. The average Ni concentration of 274 μg kg-1, was observed in soy products, including soy drinks, which increases the risk of excessive Ni exposure for lactose-intolerant children. Besides, as EFSA raised a concern on elevated Ni concentrations previously observed in beer, a large number of samples, i.e. 244 in total, were collected, including commercially available beers, raw materials and semi-products used in the beer production process. Low nickel concentrations were detected in all of these samples, e.g. on average 8.36 µg kg-1 for commercially available beers. So beer, which is largely consumed in Belgium, is not relevant to the exposure of the Belgian population to nickel. In conclusion, food products with elevated nickel concentrations and their potential contamination routs have been identified in this study.

Soil arsenic concentration has been found to vary across the landscape of Bangladesh. The overall management of the paddy soils play a critical role in the loading of arsenic into the soils, with the paddy soils having a higher content of arsenic than the adjacent non-irrigated soils, and soils irrigated with groundwater having a higher content of arsenic than those irrigated with surface water. While the surface waters in Bangladesh are at risk of toxic heavy metals contamination from a range of anthropogenic sources, inputs of toxic elements are expected in the paddy field soils irrigated by the contaminated surface waters posing a threat to the food security of Bangladesh. Moreover, land topological variations at the local level may make the mobilization and retention of arsenic and other geochemical elements more complex within the six inundation land types of Bangladesh. Over 1200 surface paddy soil samples were collected from across Bangladesh, which were categorized according to inundation land type (highland, medium highland-1, medium highland-2, medium lowland, lowland, and very lowland) and by source of irrigation water (groundwater and surface water). While the groundwater irrigated paddy soils had significantly higher arsenic contents than in the surface water irrigated pddy soils, the contents of aluminium, cobalt, copper, iron, potassium, magnesium, molybdenum, nickel, lead, sodium, and zinc were significantly higher in the paddy soils irrigated with surface waters compared to the soils irrigated with groundwater. Highly significant variations (ANOVAF = 24.74, p lowland > medium highland-2 > medium lowland > highland > medium highland-1, with the very lowland having the highest mean arsenic content of 9.95 mg/kg. Other geochemical elements analysed followed similar trends, with the exception of cadmium (the highest in the medium highland-2 (0.24 mg/kg), followed by highland (0.21 mg/kg)) in the paddy soils. Soil pH and the other geochemical elements analysed varied significantly (p This study revealed that irrigating paddy soils with surface waters in Bangladesh increased toxic element loads in the soils. Elevated accumulation of the toxic elements in the low-lying flooded soils due to complex landscape topographical changes within the local areas poses a substantial risk to the rice cultivation, which is extensively done in those low level lands across Bangladesh. The present study thus gives high importance to further investigation of spatial and temporal variability and distribution of the geochemical elements in irrigated paddy fields with respect to the inundation land types in Bangladesh.

Selenium is a key component of various selenoproteins involved in enzymatic activities and particularly in redox homeostasis and in thyroid hormone metabolism. Deficiency of Se in human nutrition affects biological functions, being in relationship with function of Se-proteins and metabolism of Se, increases the risk of occurrence of degenerative diseases. One promising strategy to counteract Se deficiency in humans is Se biofortification of staple food plants. Rice represents one of the most important staple foods worldwide; a lot of attention has been attributed to enhance biofortification of Se in in rice as well as in other foods in the present project. Rice seeds of 41 BRRI/local T. aman varieties were collected from Bangladesh Rice Research Institutes (BRRI) and farmers of different areas of Bangladesh. The seedlings were raised in the field laboratory of the Department of Soil Science, BAU. Two Se treatments (0 and 120 g/ha Se; calculated on ha furrow slice basis) were used in the experiment. The experiment was laid out in completely randomized design (CRD) with 41 varieties and each variety was replicated three times for both Se treatments. Trace element grade sodium selenate (Na2SeO4) was used as a source of Se. Besides, Se content in rice we studied the growth and yield parameters of rice to see if there is any effect of Se. In T. aman season we tested 41 rice varieties/land-races for their response to Se treatment. Interestingly we listed 17 varieties/land-races out of 41 showed positive effect of Se on yield. The varieties are Absaya, Binadhan-14, Binadhan-17, Biroy, BR 22, BRRI dhan53, BRRIdhan32, BRRI dhan38, BRRI dhan52, BRRI dhan57, BRRI dhan62, BRRI dhan66, BRRI dhan71, Kumari, Mala, Maloti, Super rice.

People living this area always eat the vegetables planted by themselves, which might be exposures to a higher health risk as result of the heavy metals pollution issues. However, to our knowledge, there are few studies on investigating the latest presentation of this issue comparing that of urban village and rural village. It is imperative to clarify the transport relationship of heavy metals (such as Cd and As) from soils/irrigation water, to vegetables and to human’s hairs. In the current investigation work, we collected 83 hair samples, 16 soil samples, 8 ditch sediments, 16 irrigation water, and 49 vegetable samples in three urban villages and one rural village (as control) located at Foshan, a developed industrial city in Southern China. The pH, total C, total N and total P concentrations of soil and sediment samples, meanwhile the Cd and As concentrations of all samples were analysed. The results showed that both the Cd and As contents in human hairs of urban village were higher than that of rural village (median values, 0.036-0.038 vs 0.034 mg kg-1, and 0.17 vs 0.19-0.23 mg kg-1 for Cd and As, respectively), indicating the human living in urban village exposure to a higher health risk resulting from heavy mental pollution. The As concentrations of the four most widely consumed vegetables (i.e., Chinese flowering cabbage, leaf lettuce, sweet potato vine and India lettuce) planted in urban village were 111-858 mg kg-1, 276-4150 mg kg-1, 98.4-250 mg kg-1 and 931-4485 mg kg-1, which were significantly higher than that planted in rural village (with 16.3 mg kg-1, 236 mg kg-1, 4.65 mg kg-1 and 220 mg kg-1, respectively). Most of people buy other eatable food including meat, fish and rice from market, therefore, the vegetables containing high level of Cd and As potentially led to their health risk. Soils collected from the four villages contained Cd and As with 0.375-0.657 mg kg-1 and 10.2-16.8 mg kg-1, respectively. Farmers of urban village did not care of the cost and applied quantity of fertilizer exceeding demand of vegetable plants because the size of their vegetable garden was so small (even less than 20 m2). Consequently, the vegetable soils of urban villages were acidized dramatically and with 0.39-1.02 lower pH than that of rural village. Lower pH activated the Cd and As contained in soils and thereafter increased the Cd and As uptake by vegetable plants. In addition, nearby ditch sediments (even containing more Cd and As than soils) and Cd/As polluted river water were used as organic fertilizer and irrigation water were other two main sources of Cd and As in vegetable. In conclusion, human living in urban village were exposure to higher health risk as results of their self-supplied vegetables planted in Cd and As polluted soils with so small size and re-contaminated by irrigation water and ditch sediment, which is a new insight to urban village in developing countries.

Wang and H. Li* Beijing Key Laboratory of Farmland Soil Pollution Prevention and Remediation / College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, China Agricultural University, PRC 884314659@qq.com No evidence has proved that selenium (Se) is an essential micronutrient element for plants growth, but it is beneficial for human health at optimal dosages. Nevertheless, the attention has been largely paid to examine Se content in food stuffs because of Se deficiency in soil. Se fertilizers application to the soil is a beneficial measure to enhance Se content in crops, especially in the edible parts, and eventually achieved Se supplementation for human. As one of the elemental Se species, Se nanoparticles (SeNPs) have entered the field of version with the advantages of high biological activity and low toxicity compared with inorganic Se and organic Se. Unfortunately, little information is available on SeNPs uptake by plants. Therefore, in this study, the effects of different particle sizes of SeNPs as well as different pH on the absorption of Se by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) were investigated through hydroponics experiments in greenhouse. The results showed that SeNPs with different particle sizes had various characteristics for the absorption and transportation in different plants. SeNPs with 50 nm was more easily to be transferred from roots to shoots than SeNPs with larger sizes (i.e. 100 nm and 150 nm); and the transportation of Se was limited since the translocation factors were below 0.1 of all the treatments. In addition, Se absorption by plants was also affected by pH. Selenite [Se(IV)] was more easily absorbed by plants at lower pH, but SeNPs could be absorbed at an optimal pH and utilized efficiently by both of wheat and rice. Our research could provide some theoretical bases for using a new Se resource to enhance the Se content in agricultural products and increase the intake of Se by the populations.

Hence, a 3 x 4 factorial randomized complete block design with 3 rates of P fertilizer and 4 rates of Se was conducted under a glasshouse condition to determine the effect of P in soil on Se accumulation in local green spinach (Amaranthus spp.). There were 12 treatments in total and each treatment was replicated three times. Green spinach was grown in pot containing sandy clay soil and applied with Se at rates 0, 60, 120 and 180 g/ha as sodium selenite. Phosphorus fertilizer was applied at 0, 50 and 100% from the recommended amount (23 kg/ha P2O5) as diammonium phosphate (DAP). Meanwhile, nitrogen and potassium fertilizer were uniformly given to each pot at 100 kg/ha N and 144 kg/ha K2O, in the form of urea and muriate of potash (MOP), respectively. The amount of urea was added after taking into consideration of the amount of nitrogen present in DAP. Results from this study show that dry matter of green spinach is affected by the P rates at different level of Se rates. Highest dry matter was obtained when Se was applied at 120 g/ha with 100% of P fertilizer. Reducing P fertilizer into 0 and 50% had reduced the dry matter of spinach and it can be seen when 60 and 120 g/ha Se were applied. In terms of Se accumulation, spinach leaves accumulated higher Se followed by stems and roots. Selenium uptake by leaves and stems of green spinach is affected by the P fertilizer rates at different level of Se rates. In leaves and stems, the highest uptake was observed when 120 g/ha Se with 100% of P fertilizer were applied. However, at 120 g/ha Se, reducing P fertilizer into 50% and 0% had no effect on the uptake of Se by spinach’s leaves and stems, respectively. Meanwhile, Se intake in roots was not affected by the P fertilizer at different level of Se rates. At various P rates, no significant difference were observed in Se intake by roots. Whereas, higher Se uptake by roots was observed when 120 & 180 g/ha Se were applied. Earlier studies indicated that P could reduce the uptake and accumulation of Se in plants. However, antagonistic effect of P fertilizer addition on Se uptake by spinach leaves was observed only at higher Se rate of 180 g/ha Se. According to Liu et al. (2004), when the P supply meet the needs of plant growth, it could promote accumulation of selenium in the shoots. The presence of P also could decrease Se sorption on soil surface and increase the Se concentration in the soil solution. Carter et al (1972) also mentioned that the P application may have stimulated plants to absorb more Se because of increased in root proliferation. In conclusion, although earlier studies pointed out that P could reduce Se uptake by plants, contradictory results were obtained from this study. Applying P fertilizer as recommended could increase yield as well as the Se uptake by leaves and stems of spinach Selenium at 120 g/ha applied to sandy clay soil can be considered as the optimum rate as higher rates could reduce plant yield and decrease the Se uptake by spinach.

F. Shengb* and Y. Gaoa a Institute of Agricultural Resources and Environment, Jiangsu Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China b College of Life Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, China wchen@jaas.ac.cn Silicate weathering in terrestrial ecosystems plays an important role in the formation of soil and soil nutrients, in neutralization of acid rain, and in the long-term drawdown of atmospheric CO2. Many studies indicate that bacteria can signiﬁcantly affect mineral dissolution by different ways, such as producing acids and metal-complexing ligands, changing redox conditions, or mediating the formation of secondary mineral phases. Exopolysaccharides are also reported to be related to mineral weathering. The probable mechanisms included chelating the structural elements, breaking chemical equilibrium by absorbing ions, forming biofilm and so on. However, there are little reports on the key genes involved in this process. So, this study focuses on the mineral-weathering genes. A high effective mineral-weathering bacterium, strain M78, was isolated from the adjacent soil of purple siltstone in Yanting, Sichuan Province, China. Potash feldspar which is one of the main silicates in purple siltstone was used as the test mineral. The dissolved elements of Fe, Si and Al by this strain in two days turned out to be 0.45 mg L-1, 0.38 mg L-1 and 0.13 mg L-1, respectively. The result of the 16S rDNA sequencing showed that strain M78 belonged to the species of Ensifer adhaerens. The production of exopolysaccharides of strain M78 was 0.82±0.01 mg mL-1, which we presumed to be the main factor responsible for the mineral-weathering efficiency. We used transposon insertion method to screen for the genes involved in mineral weathering. A mutation library was built, and the mutants with significantly declined production of exopolysaccharides were the target of screening. We got three target mutants (T3, T6 and 10), the exopolysaccharides productions of which were 0.37±0.07 mg mL-1, 0.31±0.01 mg mL-1 and 0.29±0.06 mg mL-1. The functional groups on the surface of exopolysaccharides were compared between the mutants and the wild type by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The result showed mutants T3 and T6 could produce different exopolysaccharides compared to wild type. The genome walking and genome-wide scanning were taken to locate the inserted genes. The results showed that the inserted genes of the mutants were found to be ctrA, yfiH and kspE coding cell cycle response regulator, polyphenol oxidase, capsule polysaccharide ABC transporter permease, respectively. According to the different characters between the mutants and the wild type, we suggest that ctrA, yfiH and kspE may be involved in the mineral-weathering through the process of synthesis and transportation of the exopolysaccharides in different ways.

Its fields of application range from semi-conductor industries, optical and telecommunication industries to applications in the biomedical field as well as geological research. Taking into account the constantly expanding market and increasing applications of Ge, its geochemical characteristics and spatial distribution in various natural materials (rocks, soil, water) is of great significance for the assessments of the mineral resource potential and for environmental purposes. Nevertheless, reliable soil Ge data are still rare in the literature mainly due to the low abundance of Ge with 1.7ppm background of soils in China. The primary aim of this research is to depict the distribution of Ge in Beibu Gulf top and deep soils and find out the factors effecting its distribution which will provide a base for deeper geochemical study of Ge in soils. The concentrations of Ge in soils were determined by AFS, and their spatial distribution patterns generated using a GIS software. Besides, the main mineral phases in soils were identified by XRD. It is concluded that soil Ge concentrations are mainly controlled by lithology of the bedrock, as the soils derived from carbonates and granites usually have the highest Ge concentrations. In addition, soil parameters like TOC, clay minerals also have noticeable influence on Ge concentrations. Al–bearing minerals (including kaolinite and a few gibbsite) play a primary role in Ge accumulation in the soils derived from granites. By contrast, in the soils derived from carbonates, quaternary sediments, sandstones and shales, soil Ge is mainly rich in both Al–bearing and Fe–bearing minerals(mainly goethite), and soil organic matter may also lead to high level of Ge in top soils. Whereas, quartz always result in a low level of Ge in soil. As soil is a huge nature pool for Ge, to make full use of soil Ge, the further research should focus on which soil fractions are the dominantly available parts sequestrating Ge in soils with various bedrocks, what methods could be used to accumulate Ge and extract it from soil. In addition, in order to figure out if crops fostered on Ge-rich soils can uptake Ge and how these crops will effect on human health, there is a need for future studies on the uptake mechanisms and stoichiometry of Ge uptake under field conditions and plant-soil-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere as well as the chemical speciation in different plant parts.

Field experiment was set in the potential zinc deficiency area of the Loess Plateau. There are six treatments of control; spraying ZnO NPs at the jointing stage; spraying bulk ZnO , ZnSO4 and ZnO NPs at jointing stage and filling stage; spraying ZnO NPs at jointing stage, heading stage, flowering stage and filling stage . The results showed that there were no significant differences in grain yield, panicle number and 1000-grain weight of winter wheat. Among all treatments, there were no significant effect on trace elements such as Mn and Cu in wheat grains, but had a significant effect on Zn and Fe content. Compared with CK, the spraying of zinc fertilizer significantly increased the zinc content of grain. The effect of spraying zinc with different zinc fertilizers in the same period was in ZnO NPs, reaching 30.48 mg·kg -1 , which was 70% higher than that of control.

However, information for seedling growth and roots development in NP-treated plants is incomplete. In this study, the effects of ZnO NPs (0 - 200 mg/L) on the growth of maize and mung bean were studied by designing hydroponic experiments. Analyses involve root indexes (root fresh weight, root length, root volume, root surface area) using root scanner, root morphology with scanning electron microscope, plant fresh weight, metal biouptake and enzymes activities. Comparative toxicity profiles of the ionic salts (ZnSO4) are developed. The results showed that, the Zn content of maize and mung bean increased gradually with the increase of the concentration of ZnO NPs compared with the control. At the 6th week, the Zn content of the shoots and the roots increased by more than 90%. Root indexes and fresh weight were inhibited with the ZnO NPs treatments from low concentration of 10 mg/L.

The BRAVE (Bangladesh Risk of Acute Vascular Events) study is a large-scale case-control study aimed at investigating the effects of environmental, genetic, lifestyle and biochemical factors on coronary heart disease in Bangladesh. As part of the BRAVE study, toenail clippings were taken from each participant. Toenails can be used as effective biomarkers of toxic element exposure and mineral status, for several reasons, e.g. non-invasive collection, easy storage and transport, resistance to decay, limited exogenous exposure, and no fluctuation in element levels due to metabolic activities (unlike blood). The analysis of the toenail samples includes a number of procedures that aims at limiting the ambiguity of external contamination: sampling with questionnaire, washing, digestion, ICP-MS estimation of element concentrations, and interpretation with statistical analysis. In this study, the cleaning protocol included the use of different solvents in sequence: acetone, milli-Q water and 0.5% Triton X-100 solution, a non-ionic detergent. For a number of samples, each rinse solution was retained for analysis by ICP-MS, to ensure an effective removal of exogenous contaminants. The obtained data of this study have so far showed high elemental variabilities amongst samples. Additionally, replicates have been analysed for a selection of specimens, with the analysis showing strong heterogeneity of the toenail samples, for elements such as Mn, Co and Mo.

Communications between roots and between soil microorganisms and roots, i.e. rhizosphere processes, occur and change continuously influencing for instance the nutrients availability, their soil transport and plant uptake. The main driving force of these mechanisms seems to be related to root exudation processes. Root exudates comprise in fact a number of different organic (e.g. low molecular weight and high molecular weight organic compounds) and inorganic (e.g. protons and HCO3) chemicals and can reach concentrations up to 250 mg C /g root produced of the photosynthetically fixed carbon. Several nutrients, in particular trace elements, are mainly either adsorbed or structural components of soil minerals, i.e. the quantitatively largest fraction in soil. Root exudates might interact with the minerals leading to mineral weathering and thus to the mobilization of trace elements with a consequent increase in their plant available fraction. However, root exudates have short half-lives because of the large microbial activity at the soil–root interface, which might limit their effects on nutrient mobility and acquisition. In addition, exudates also have a selective effect on the microbial community present in the rhizosphere. The presentation provides an overview of the rhizosphere processes involved in nutrients acquisition by soil organisms (plants and microorganisms) focusing in particular on micronutrients (iron and copper). In particular, the presentation provides information on (i) nutrients availability in soils, including mineral weathering, ligand and element competition and plant-microbe competition; (ii) microbe–plant interactions, focusing on beneficial microbial communities and their association with plants, and (iii) plant–soil interactions involving the metabolic changes triggered by nutrient deficiency and the processes involved in exudate release from roots.

Rhizosphere and root-detritusphere are two typical hotspots which dominate the element transferring between soils and plants. Labile flux maxima of As can be observed both in rice rhizosphere and root-detritusphere areas, specifically in root tips for living root and along the root axis for dead root. However, in contrast to the spatial distribution of As bioavailability, significant depletion of P labile flux was found around both the living and dead roots. The P labile flux decreases by 68–76% in the root-detritusphere area (2–4 mm from the root axis), similar to the spatial patterns of Fe. Decomposition of dead roots might provide channels for O2 diffusion, supporting the aerobic microsites in deeper soils and leading to the lower kinetics of P exchange process from soils to soil solution. Generally, the in-situ high resolution methods combining DGT-LA-ICPMS and planar optode support a more holistic understanding of biogeochemical processes of elements in the soil hotspots.

These modifications may drive trace element (TE) availability in soil and their bioavailability to soil organisms but with no consistent trends as shown by a literature overview. In this work we studied the effects of plant-earthworm interactions on the copper (Cu) availability in rhizosphere and its consequences on Cu phytoavailability in soils receiving either mineral fertilizers or organic inputs. Plant-earthworm interactions were studied with the RHIZOtest, a biotest that enables to grow plants with their roots in contact with the soil layer (considered as the rhizosphere) but not prenetrating it. The RHIZOtest was deployed here in an original manner: (i) without plant and earthworm (i.e. bulk soil), (ii) with plants (Festuca arrundinaceae) only (i.e. rhizosphere), (iii) with epi-endogeic earthworms (Dichogaster saliens) only (i.e. drilosphere), and (iv) with both plants and earthworms (i.e. rhizo-drilosphere). Two soil samples from the same decadal field experiment were studied, one amended with mineral fertilizers that led to a strongly acidic pH (5.0) and a low organic carbon content (2.0 %) and the other amended with cow slurries that led to a ca. neutral pH (6.5) and much higher organic carbon content (2.9 %). In order to study the pH as a key parameter, the pH was manipulated and controlled in the rhizosphere, drilosphere, and rhizo-drilosphere either by favoring alkalization or by maintaining the initial bulk-soil pH. Copper availability was determined in bulk soils, rhizospheres, drilospheres and rhizo-drilospheres following (i) a kinetic approach based on the diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) and (ii) an equilibrium approach based on the measurements of total Cu concentration and Cu2+ activity in soil solution. The drivers of Cu speciation in soil solution were assessed by modelling using the windermere humic aqueous model (WHAM). Copper phytoavailability was determined by estimating Cu uptake flux in plants. Results showed that plants and earthworms respectively increased rhizosphere and drilosphere pH when the bulk-soil pH was initially strongly acidic, and decreased rhizosphere and drilosphere DOM concentration. Overall, such physical-chemical changes in the rhizosphere and the drilosphere led to a decrease in Cu availability compared to the initial bulk soil. Results of the biotests are discussed taken into account the hypothesis that plants and earthworms act synergistically to further reduce Cu availability in the rhizo-drilosphere.

This provides an ecological niche for a specific group of metal-accumulating plants, called hyperaccumulators, which have been investigated for a couple of decades to identify the underlying mechanisms of trace metal solubilisation, accumulation and tolerance. The influence of soil characteristics on the Ni accumulation potential is still insufficiently known. Therefore, a study based on field-collected soil and plant samples was carried out for assessing the relationship between soil characteristics and plant Ni concentration in the hyperaccumulator Noccaea goesingensis. In the east of Austria two gradients of Ni concentration and soil formation were evaluated, each consisting of three sampling locations. On each location 6 plant and rhizosphere samples and one composite bulk soil sample were collected and analyzed for their element concentrations as well as physicochemical and microbiological characteristics. Standard soil parameters (C, N, pH, CEC, etc.) as well as concentrations of operationally defined Ni fractions were recorded (extracted by H2O, Sr(NO3)2, DTPA, and assessed by the diffusive gradients in thin films technique (DGT)). Furthermore, the bacterial density and diversity were determined for bulk and rhizosphere soil samples as well as root samples. Functional bacterial diversity was assessed by cultivation in Biolog EcoPlatesTM. Along the first gradient, a decrease of total Ni as well as pH was found, whereas organic carbon contents and CEC increased. Changes along the second gradient were less pronounced. Characteristics of plant-free bulk soil samples were correlated with shoot Ni concentrations. Among the assessed soil Ni fractions in bulk soil samples from each sampling spot, the highest correlations with shoot Ni concentrations were found for water-extractable Ni (r2 = 0.85) and total Ni (r2 = 0.82). Non-significant (p 2 = 0.59) and Sr(NO3)2-extractable Ni (r2 = 0.56).

No clear trend was found for Sr(NO3)2- and water-extractable Ni as well as pH and Ni resupply (measured by the DGT technique). Bacterial density and diversity was higher in rhizosphere soils compared to bulk soils. The diversity of root endophytes was lower than in the corresponding rhizosphere soils. The density of Ni-tolerant bacteria was significantly correlated with total Ni concentration (r2 = 0.9, p Our results suggest that total Nickel concentration in soil is the most significant factor influencing plant Ni accumulation and rhizosphere bacterial community characteristics.

This study aims to investigate the macroscopic and molecular interactions of EDDS with Cu in the rhizosphere and the non-rhizosphere of Cu mine polluted agricultural soil. A multi-interlayer rhizobox planted with ryegrass was used to study the transport of EDDS and Cu from the non-rhizosphere to the rhizosphere. The results showed that EDDS (5 mM kg-1) obviously dissociated Cu (by 285-690-fold), Fe (by 3.47-60.2-fold), and Al (by 2.43-5.31-fold) into the soluble fraction from soil composite compared to the control without EDDS. The combination of micro-X-ray fluorescence, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and sequential extraction analysis revealed that EDDS primarily chelated with Cu from the adsorbed fraction with goethite instead of clay minerals; this phenomenon is probably due to the dissolution of Fe oxides promoted by EDDS. Moreover, as facilitated by ryegrass transpiration, EDDS and Cu were transported from the non-rhizosphere to the rhizosphere and accumulated in the latter. Cu was transported in the form of a CuEDDS complex with no competition from Fe and Al via solution modelling, due to a stronger complexation role of EDDS with Cu. The in situ mechanisms of Cu extraction and transport by EDDS in the rhizosphere are first elucidated with multiple speciation analysis methods, which are important in the application and improvement of EDDS-assisted phytoextraction in field-contaminated soils.

Zhao and P. Wang College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, China 2017203017@njau.edu.cn Arsenic (As) is an ubiquitous toxin in the environment and contamination of paddy soils with elavated levels of As presents a threat to food safety. The status of soil redox potential has a substantial impact on the speciation and the subsequent mobilization of As in paddy soils. The rice rhizospheric microenvironment is more oxidized than the bulk soil. How this rhizospheric effect affects the biogeochemical processes associated with the transformations of As remains poorly understood. In this study, we used a novel rhizobox with a field As-contaminated soil (101.2 mg As kg-1) to investigate the in situ transformation of As in the rhizosphere of two rice cultivars which differs in the radial oxygen loss (ROL). Results showed that during the rice seedling stage, dissolved concentrations of As in the rhizospheric porewater were 2.2-3.1 fold higher than those in the bulk soil, with the As concentrations decreasing with the distance from the root surface. The decreasing rate can be modelled through a reciprocal eqution [y= 378.3+ 283.8/(0.3743+ x), R2= 0.97]. Along the root profile, dissolved As concentrations decreased from the root tip to the mature zone, with the former being 32.4%-63.7% higher than the latter during different growth stages of two rice cultivars. Among the dissolved As species, rhizospheric concentartions of arsenate (As(V)) were 38.4%-64.3% lower in the cultivar Yangdao (with a higher ROL) than those in the cultivar Shenyou, despite a similar total dissolved As. This is likely attributed to a higher ROL in Yangdao which can promote the the formation of iron oxides (e.g. iron plaque) on the root surface, increasing As(V) adsorption. Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing data showed that iron-reducing bacteria could play an important role in the coupling of As(V) and ferric (Fe(III)) reduction, including the geobacter and clostrium, which were increased by 3.1 and 12.4 times in the rhizosphere compared with those in the bulk soil, respectively. The As functional genes such as arsenite (As(III)) oxidase gene (aioA), As(V) reductase gene (arsC), As(V) respiratory reductase gene (arrA) and As(III) methyltransferase gene (arsM) were found 18.2, 13.8, 3.1 and 1.6 times higher in the rhizosphere than those in the bulk soil, respectively. These data show that the biogeochemical processes of As and Fe occurred in the rhozosphere can influence As mobilization in soil and subsequent availabiity to rice plants.

Phytomining constitutes a non-destructive technology for the recovery of metals which could be potentially applied to obtaining scarce (rare earth elements (REEs), tungsten (W)) or valuable (gold (Au)) elements. Soil microbial processes involved in metal mobility and availability to plants represent a central role in the phytoextraction efficiency of metals such as Ni, but their involvement in the case of rare elements is unclear. In this context, the objectives of the present work were to (a) identify, in areas of geological interest, plant species which possess the ability to extract and accumulate trace elements and (b) isolate and characterize the rhizosphere bacterial communities associated with this vegetation and elucidate bacterial mechanisms involved in the geochemical cycling of strategic elements, with the view to developing phytomining techniques for the recovery of strategic elements. Exploratory studies were conducted in two abandoned opencast mines in NW Spain. The mines were dedicated to the extraction of either, tungsten (W) and copper (Cu) in San Finx (Galicia), or gold (Au) and molybdenum (Mo) in Salave (Asturias). Samples of the dominant vegetation, rocks, bulk and rhizosphere soil were collected in different locations of each mine area. Trace element concentrations in soils and in the aboveground plant biomass were determined by ICP-MS. Rhizosphere bacteria were isolated from the soil and screened for W and Mo resistance, ability to produce organic acids, siderophores, biosurfactants, IAA and phosphate solubilisation capacity. Batch culture assays using selected bacterial strains and ground rock, or soil, were performed to evaluate their weathering capacities. Significant concentrations of the REEs La, Ce and Y, as well as Mo, were detected in both mine areas, which were for some plant species reflected in their aboveground tissues. Salix spp., Erica spp. (in San Finx) and Pteridium spp. (in Salave) harboured a higher number of bacterial isolates with ability to produce siderophores and surfactants, whereas the tolerance to high concentrations of W and Mo was generalised amongst most bacterial isolates. Furthermore, the growth and activity of different bacterial strains induced the mobilisation of different critical or valuable elements after their incubation with soil from Salave or San Finx. To conclude, the prospection of abandoned mining areas could allow the identification of plant species with capacity to accumulate rare elements, further our understanding of the microbial communities inhabiting these soils and identify beneficial bacterial strains with application in phytomining techniques.

Despite its abundance, Fe is mostly present under ferric form in soils, strongly limiting its bioavailability. To overcome the challenge of Fe acquisition, many microorganisms produce siderophores to retrieve Fe from natural sources. Another ubiquitous feature of bacteria in natural environments is biofilm formation. Previous studies showed that external Fe strongly influenced biofilm formation in several bacteria, suggesting that this microenvironment could play a mechanistic role in micronutrient acquisition for bacteria. Here, we apply a complementary set of analytical methods and deletion mutants to evaluate the role of biofilm formation, siderophore production, and their interaction, on Fe homeostasis in Bacillus subtilis. We observed that Fe homeostasis, i.e. active growth at constant intracellular Fe concentration, requires both siderophore production and biofilm formation. Also, we report that in B. subtilis both biofilm formation and siderophore production are required to achieve active Fe acquisition from the medium, and to sustain normal growth. Furthermore, we provide evidences that the formation of biofilm slightly enhances the kinetics of Fe complexation by catechol siderophores and markedly improves siderophore use efficiency. Put together, our results demonstrate a close link between biofilm formation, siderophore production and iron acquisition in B. subtilis, allowing a better comprehension of how B. subtilis can cope with metal limitation in environmental conditions. These results provide new perspectives on the mechanism underlying siderophore-based acquisition of Fe in biofilm-forming bacteria.

Although Cd is considered to be a non-essential element for plants, it is effectively absorbed by the root system of many plant species and can be subsequently transported throughout the plant. Recent studies have shown that the forage species chicory (Cichorium intybus L.) and plantain (Plantago lanceolate L.) accumulate a significantly higher shoot Cd concentration than the traditional pasture species ryegrass and clover. Forage crops are now common in New Zealand farm systems, and the potential implications of elevated Cd on food safety are actively being explored. The current study was designed to assess Cd uptake in forage species as a function of Cd soil chemistry in the rhizosphere. Cadmium complexed to organic compounds can be separated and quantified using gel exclusion and high performance liquid chromatography. However, the determination of free Cd2+ ions in rhizosphere soil and plant sap presents an analytical challenge. To achieve the aims of the current study, methodology needed to be developed to quantify different Cd species such as, free Cd2+ ion and Cd complexed with different organic compounds in both the rhizosphere soil and plant sap. Low-cost electrochemical methods such as stripping voltammetry (SV), which use working electrodes that have been selected for activity to target metals, show promise for monitoring low concentrations of free Cd2+ in environmental samples. In the current study a chemically modified carbon paste electrode to determine free Cd2+ ions was developed. The electrode was used with square wave anodic stripping voltammetry for analytical determinations. A carbon paste electrode was first prepared using graphite powder mixed with Bi2O3 as the electrode carbon source. Free Cd2+ was pre-concentrated on the surface of the modified electrode at −1.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl and then re-oxidized during a stripping step. The accuracy of measurements was validated against screen printed carbon paste electrodes. In initial work, the lower limit of detection of this electrode was 0.2 mg Cd2+/L solution. Further development of the electrode using sugar charcoal as the carbon source mixed with a novel Cd2+ ion binding ligand is currently in progress to reduce the detection limit to nanomolar levels. This paper explains the systematic development of a chemically modified carbon paste electrode that can be used for the determination of free Cd2+ ion concentration in rhizosphere soil solution and plant sap.

So it’s very important to know how the lettuce response when the soil was polluted by Cd. In our early study we found that Cd uptake in lettuce differed significantly among several lettuce cultivars after planted in a same Cd-contaminated field.

They play a crucial role in nutrient uptake, making microorganisms important drivers for plant development and ecological successions. Many soil parameters can drive the adaptability or acclimation of soil living organisms like plants or bacterias. Micro-organisms adaptation is a fast process according to their short life cycle and their ability to host plasmids which can be transferred to other community members. As a drastic selective factor, high metallic soil content may promote strong and site specific micro-organisms evolution. In addition, a few studies suggested that bacteria may decrease the accumulation of toxic trace metals by plants, thereby improving plant development on highly contaminated soils. This is highly valuable for phytostabilization approaches, whose goal is to stimulate the development of a self-sustainable plant cover on polluted sites, in order to limit pollutant release and transfer to the environment. However, to our knowledge, no specific bacterial strains are currently commercially available for phytostabilization purposes. In this respect, we performed additional studies on a phytostabilization field experiment onto metallurgical slags, to: i) document the mid-term natural response of microbial populations to the various forcing conditions and ii) identifying slag-compatible Plant Growth Promoting Bacteria (PGPB) which could help plants to grow in this extreme environment.

The plants were harvested at after thirty days of cultivation and analyzed for various elemental, physiological and biochemical parameters. The experimental soil samples were analyzed for different characteristics before and after cultivation. The results revealed that the maize cultivars were significantly modulating the rhizospheric ion dynamics, when stressed by Cd. Cadmium toxicity in sensitive cultivar (31P41) exhibited more prominent reduction in leaf area, chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids, root and shoot biomass, total protein contents and catalase activity as compared to the tolerant one. Increase in applied Cd stress significantly elevated the production of MDA, total proline, phenolic content and production of antioxidant enzyme (SOD, POD) in tolerant cultivar as compared to the sensitive one. The uptake and translocation of N, P, K, Ca2+, Mg2+, Zn2+ and Fe2+ from rhizosphere and root cell sap was found significantly higher in tolerant cultivar (3062) in contrast with sensitive one (31P41) under Cd stress. The summary of the outcomes elaborated that the Cd as a divalent ion which compete with other nutrients and reduced there uptake and translocation factor, which in response retarded the growth and metabolism in maize plant.

The involved mechanisms remain howecver poorly understood. In order to better understand the role of bacterial cells in metal leaching, we conducted a coupled study under static and dynamic conditions. Firstly we evaluated Zn and Cd metal biosorption onto active or inactive Gram negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Cupriavidus metallidurans CH34) by characterizing the sub-cellular distribution of the metals through a cell disruption approach. The quantification of Zn and Cd in extracellular, membrane and cytoplasm compartments of the cells permitted to show that metals are unequally distributed between the three cell compartments and also between the two different bacteria. Metals internalization appeared surprizingly to be the dominant accumulation process of metals (high cytoplasm contents). These results suggest that adsorption onto cell surface is only a first step in metal management by bacteria and that bacteria can internalize important amounts of heavy metals. The so-determined thermo-dynamic reactivity constants were used to fit metal breakthrough curves performed in natural sand columns. Transport experiments of bacterial cells, metals or mixtures of bacteria and/or metals demonstrated that bacteria are able to enhance and accelerate Cd and Zn transport in natural sand columns. This transport process was shown to dominate metal aqueous transport and was correctly fitted using a combined transport and geochemical modeling approach. Altogether, these results show that, under specific conditions, bacterial cells can increase metal pollutants mobility in soils, which can be damaging for environmental quality but also interesting in terms of soil remediation perspectives.

These elevated soil F concentrations may have the potential to negatively impact soil microorganisms which underpin New Zealand’s agricultural economy. Ongoing soil F monitoring requires an accurate and simple test to establish comprehensive soil F management practices, and quantify both the total and bioavailable concentration of F in soil.

We found that the normal rod-shaped bacterium cell was morphologically altered when Rhizobium was exposed to fluoride concentration above 100 mg/L through a laboratory incubation experiment. This concentration is orders of magnitude higher than those recorded for New Zealand agriculture soils under ‘normal conditions’. Therefore, there is no indication of an imminent risk by soil F to Rhizobium leguminosarum.

Feil, Y. Pii, F. Valentinuzzi, R. Tiziani, Tanja Mimmo and S.

The concentrations of Cu exceed the safety limits of risk assessment for Cu in soil and this may cause toxicity in plants. Scientific knowledge about the interaction between Cu and other nutrients is still scarce, also the impact of Cu on the mechanisms underlying mineral nutrients uptake at root level. These aspects might be of paramount importance in the case of phosphorus (P), which is an essential macronutrient for all plants species. In this work hydroponically grown cucumber plants were used to investigate the influence of different Cu concentrations (i.e. 0.2, 5, 25 and 50 µM) on i) the phenotypic traits of plants, particularly at root level, ii) the nutrient content in both root and shoot, iii) the P uptake activity at both biochemical and molecular levels. The data display significances under elevated Cu concentrations: the growth of shoots and roots resulted stunted, and the net P uptake diminished. Furthermore, two P transporter genes were up-regulated at the highest concentration: CsPT1.4 showed a quick response, whereas CsPT1.9 seems to be involved in a long-term response to Cu toxicity. Overall, these results strengthen our hypothesis that high Cu concentrations in the growth medium can limit the uptake of P, most likely via a direct action on the uptake mechanisms (e.g. transporters) and/or by compromising the integrity of the root plasma membrane.

This Cu accumulation can induce toxicity and nutrient imbalances in several plant species. The aim of this work was thus to evaluate the effect of Cu toxicity on two grapevine rootstocks, Fercal and 196.17, and to elucidate if intercropping with oat can alleviate grapevine Cu toxicity using hydroponic trials and rhizobox experiments. The hydroponic trial revealed that root exudation was correlated with genes expression (VvPEZ-like); furthermore the PCA analysis performed on the grapevine and oat ionome revealed that both mono- and intercropped 196.17 rootstock display a synergistic effect on Zn and Mn in the root tissues at high Cu concentrations. An increase of Zn and Mn in roots was also reported for the intercropped Fercal rootstock at high Cu concentrations while an antagonistic relation was observed for root Zn concentration in the monocropped Fercal rootstock. The rhizobox experiments further confirmed these results showing a different nutrient concentration at the root level depending on the rootstock (Fercal vs. 196.17) and on the soil (acid vs. alkaline). Indeed, Cu availability is shaped by rhizosphere processes, which in turn depend on the soil properties and/or the co-cultivation of different plant species (e.g. grapevine and oat in intercropping systems). The soil-based experiments revealed that the nutrient availability and the dissolved organic carbon including root exudates differ depending on the soil properties and the rootstock rather than on the cultivation system (monocropping vs. intercropping). In particular, we did not observe any apparent competition between the two plant species (oat and grapevine) in the alkaline soil; on the other hand in the acid soil, the intercropping revealed a beneficial effect reducing the available Cu in the rhizosphere. Our results revealed that Fercal rootstock is be able to take advantage from oat, while 196.17 seems disadvantaged by the intercropping system. Yet, even though the intercropping system seems to be a valuable tool to counteract grapevine Cu toxicity, the application of this agricultural practice has shown to be species and mostly soil type dependent and should be evaluated for each rootstock.

Bacteria have evolved the ability to use arsenic to gain a competitive advantage over other bacteria at least twice. Microbes generate toxic methylarsenite (MAs(III)) by methylation of arsenite (As(III)) or reduction of methylarsenate (MAs(V)). MAs(III) is oxidized aerobically to MAs(V), making methylation a detoxification process. MAs(V) is continually re-reduced to MAs(III) by other community members, giving them a competitive advantage over sensitive bacteria. Because generation of a sustained pool of MAs(III) requires microbial communities, these complex interactions are an emergent property. We show that reduction of MAs(V) by Burkholderia sp. MR1 produces toxic MAs(III) that inhibits growth of Escherichia coli in mixed culture. There are three microbial mechanisms for resistance to MAs(III). ArsH detoxifies MAs(III) by oxidation to nontoxic MAs(V). ArsI degrades MAs(III) by cleavage of the C-As bond to form less toxic As(III). ArsP confers resistance by efflux of MAs(III). Cells of E. coli expressing the MAs(III)-resistance gene arsI, arsH or arsP grow in mixed culture with Burkholderia sp. MR1 in the presence of MAs(V). Thus MAs(III) has antibiotic properties: a toxic organic compound produced by one microbe to kill off competitors.

This has motivated over 50 years of research on Hg biogeochemistry. Still, our understanding of the processes controlling the amount of monomethylmercury available for bioaccumulation remains limited.

Special attention will be given to our understanding of Hg biogeochemistry in coastal and marine systems. The understanding of Hg cycling in marine environments is particularly incomplete even though marine harvested food is the primary monomethylmercury exposure route for most human populations. A unique feature of marine systems compared to freshwater systems is that ~30-80% of the total methylated Hg pool occurs as dimethylmercury ((CH3)2Hg). The vertical and geographical distribution of mono- and dimethylmercury have been documented in many coastal and oceanographic systems since the 90´s. More recent work has also quantified in situ transformation rates between chemical Hg forms (e.g. methylation and demethylation rates of monomethylmercury).

However, mechanistic understanding about key factors controlling Hg methylation and thus risk of MMHg in rice paddy fields are lacking. We explored the controls of key factors on Hg methylation and bioaccumulation in contaminated soil-rice systems: (1) Rice straw amendment could largely enhance Hg methylation in paddy soils and thus MMHg accumulation in rice plants; (2) Biochar amendment would largely reduce phytoavailability and thus bioaccumulation of MMHg (49–92% in rice grain), while enhance Hg methylation in soils; (3) Se amendment into soils could significantly reduce Hg methylation in soils, by forming refractory Hg-Se complexes (XANES analysis), which in turn reduced MMHg accumulation in rice plants. In contrast, Se accumulation in plants could have minor effects on reducing MMHg accumulation in rice; (4) Humus-coated clay could largely decrease Hg bioavailability; (5) Bioavailability of inorganic mercury (IHg) and MMHg decreased sharply within short period of Hg-soil contact (2-28 days), while the reduction was more evident in soils with lower organic content.

In natural fresh water and sediments, Hg is largely associated with particulate minerals and organics. However, it remains unclear under what conditions these particulates may become a sink or a source for Hg, and whether the particulate-bound Hg is available for microbial uptake and methylation. In this study, we investigated Hg sorption-desorption kinetics and thermodynamics and evaluated the potential of particulate-bound Hg for microbial methylation using a Hg-contaminated soil sediment and organic-coated hematite particles in laboratory microcosms. Mercury was found to strongly and rapidly sorb onto particulates, especially the cysteine-coated hematite and the soil sediment. Hg desorption from particulates was low (0–4%). However, the presence of Hg-binding ligands, such as low-molecular-weight thiols and humic acid, caused up to 60% of Hg desorption from the Hg-laden hematite particles, but Desulfovibrio desulfuricans ND132, and the methylation rate was 4–10 times higher than the desorption rate of Hg under anaerobic incubations. These results suggest direct interactions between bacterial cells and the particulate-bound Hg, resulting in rapid exchange and/or uptake of Hg by the bacteria. The present study thus highlights the importance of Hg partitioning at particulate-water interfaces and the role of particulate-associated Hg as a significant source for microbial methylation in the environment.

Its organic form, monomethylmercury (MMHg), poses the highest risk as it can be biomagnified in aquatic systems resulting in elevated exposure among fish and rice consumers. The gut microbiome was identified as a potential factor for the variations among individuals in Hg uptake. However, little is known about the role of gut microbiota in the gastrointestinal tract on Hg transformations and bioavailability. Current literature has shown that the human gut microbiome can demethylate MMHg, however, no known demethylating genes or microbial guilds were identified. Our goal is to determine if the alteration of the gut microbiome by diet amendment would enhance MMHg demethylation. Using a series of batch experiments, we evaluated the effects of changing nutritional component of the diet (by altering relative abundances of carbohydrate or protein) in the gut microbial community structure of two individuals. We tracked Hg methylation and demethylation rates using stable isotope tracers and conducted high throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine the microbial community structure. We observed > 90% decrease in initial MMHg concentration in protein-rich diet mixed with the fecal slurry of individual A; individual B gut microbiota did not exhibit such demethylation trend. No methylation was observed in any treatment. We followed up this experiment by mixing in different ratios of the fecal microbiota of individual A and B. The MMHg demethylation phenotype was conserved, suggesting individual A contains microbiota element necessary for MMHg demethylation that individual B does not possess. Lastly, to identify microbes involved in demethylation, we performed a series of experiments using inhibitors of 2 known demethylation reactions (i.e., sulfate reduction, methanogenesis). None of the inhibitors tested prevented demethylation indicating a new mechanism is involved. Our results indicate that the gut microbiome of individual A contains a microbiota required for demethylation of MeHg that individual B lacks. A comparative metagenomic analysis between the different nutritional amendment and individuals is underway. Our results are important in the understanding of the mechanisms for MMHg demethylation in the human gut and the variations in MMHg absorption and toxicity.

Methylmercury (MeHg) is the most concerned specie of mercury in the environment due to its high toxicity and quick accumulation along the food chain. Methylation and demethylation are the two key processes controlling the level of MeHg in aquatic environments. As the major primary producer in the ocean, microalgae are expected to play an important role in the cycling and accumulation of Hg in marine ecosystems by either absorbing Hg species from seawater or involving in the transformations of Hg species. Despite the large quantities of studies on the uptake of Hg by microalgae, there is still lack of clear knowledge on whether marine microalgae can induce the methylation and demethylation of mercury in aquatic environments. In this study, mercury isotope dilution and isotope tracer techniques were adopted to determine the methylation and demethylation of Hg at concentrations comparable to that in natural environments by 16 common marine microalgae. The tested microalgae include 8 species of diatoms, 5 species of dinoflagellates, 2 species of green algae and 1 species of golden algae. Methylation of inorganic Hg was found to be negligible in the culture of all 16 tested marine microalgae, while 7 microalgae could significantly induce the demethylation of MeHg. The rates of microalgae mediated MeHg demethylation are at the same order of magnitude as that of photodemethylation, indicating that marine microalgae may play an important role in the degradation of MeHg in the ocean. Further studies suggest that the demethylation of MeHg by the microalgae may be mainly caused by their extracellular secretions and associated bacteria, rather than the direct demethylation of MeHg by microalgal cells.

As(III) methyltransferases are found in members of every kingdom, from bacteria to humans (EC 2.1.1.137). In the human liver, hAS3MT converts inorganic arsenic into more the toxic and carcinogenic methylated species. We have determined the X-ray crystal structures of CmArsM from the thermophilic eukaryotic alga Cyanidioschyzon merolae and CrArsM from the eukaryotic green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. These two ArsMs are orthologs of hAS3MT. Analysis of their structures in various ligand-bound forms allowed us to develop a new hypothesis for catalysis involving a disulfide bond cascade. A homology model of hAS3MT was built on the structure of CmArsM with bound PhAs(III) (PDB ID: 4KW7). Interestingly, the model of human AS3MT has a cleft between the N-terminal and C- terminal domain that we propose is an allosteric site that controls the activity of AS3MT. We docked small molecules available in the NIH database with the hAS3MT model and found that they bind in the proposed allosteric site, consistent with a role for that site in regulating AS3MT catalysis.

Massive amounts of methylarsenicals such as monosodium methylarsenate [MSMA or MAs(V)] and aromatic arsenicals such as roxarsone [4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylarsenate, Rox(V)] have been utilized as herbicides and growth promoters for animal husbandry, respectively. Those pentavalent organoarsenicals gradually degrade into more toxic and mobile inorganic arsenite [As(III)], which leads environmental pollutions. We previously identified a novel aerobic MAs(V) degradation pathway composed of two steps, reduction of MAs(V) to trivalent MAs(III), followed by demethylation of MAs(III) to As(III). These two reactions are catalyzed by different bacteria. We further identified arsI, the gene that encodes the ArsI C-As lyase, a novel MAs(III) demethylase. In this study we show that the legume symbiont Sinorhizobium meliloti Rm1021 reduces both MAs(V) and pentavalent synthetic aromatic arsenicals. S. meliloti first reduces the nitro group of Rox(V) to an amino group, forming 4-hydroxy-3-aminophenylarsenate [HAPAs(V)], and subsequently reduces the arsenate group of HAPAs(V), forming HAPAs(III). A mixed culture of S. meliloti and the soil isolate Streptomyces sp. MD1 with a chromosomal arsI gene could degrade either MAs(V) or Rox(V) into As(III). We propose that aerobic microbial communities can degrade synthetic aromatic arsenicals such as Rox(V) by a multiple-step degradation pathway of sequential reduction and ArsI-catalyzed C-As bond cleavage, similar to the pathway of demethylation of the herbicide MSMA. To identify the gene responsible for reduction of the nitro group of Rox(V), we BLAST-searched the genome of S. meliloti for homologs of nitroreductases and found several candidate genes. Those genes were cloned, heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli and examined for Rox(V) nitroreductase activity. One candidate termed mdaB (modulator of drug activity_B), which encodes an ortholog of bacterial FAD-NADPH-dependent nitroreductases, exhibited roxarsone nitroreductase activity when expressed in cells of E. coli. Purified S. meliloti MdaB reduces Rox(V) to HAPAs(V) in the presence of FAD and NADPH. These results suggest involvement of mdaB in reduction of the nitro group of roxarsone by S. meliloti.

Although biological mercury methylation has been known for decades, we still have an incomplete understanding of organisms and processes driving methylation in different environments. Numerous studies have demonstrated that wetlands are “hotspot” of Hg methyltion. However, wetlands are diverse with respect to hydrology and biogeochemistry and thus the prevailing environmental conditions that control methylation and demethylation processes are highly variable. We hypothesize that the changes in the trophic status of peatlands across the succession will also be expressed in the composition of their microbial communities and thus in their potential to form MeHg. Here we used experimental laboratory incubations of peat samples from a mire chronosequence with fundamentally different ecohydrological conditions to identify master controls of mercury methylation and demethylation. The results showed that the potential mercury methylation rates decreased with the age of the peatlands, being up to 53 times higher in the youngest peatland compared to the oldest. Methylation in young mires was driven by sulfate reduction, while methanogenic and syntrophic metabolism became more important in older systems. We also show that while biotic methylmercury degradation was important in young mires, abiotic degradation was prominent in older systems. Our work demonstrates a new perspective on Hg(II) methylation across the succession of boreal peatlands which can be used to conceptualize our understanding of the dominating ecohydrological and biogeochemical controls on mercury methylation and the MeHg supply to downstream surface waters.

Knowledge regarding the mechanism of mobilization and methylation of Hg in soils is fundamental to manage the risk of this metal, particularly in paddy soils. Seasonal flooding of paddy fields leads to frequent changes of redox potential (EH), and drives series of biogeochemical reactions, thereby affecting the Hg mobilization and methylation. Therefore, we aim to investigate the mobilization and methylation of Hg in a polluted soil under dynamic redox conditions using an advanced automated biogeochemical microcosm system. The experiment was conducted under stepwise variation from reducing (around −380 mV) to oxidizing conditions (around +310 mV). The soil suspensions were regularly collected from the microcosm at the defined EH windows (-300 mV, -200 mV, -100 mV, 0 mV, +100 mV, +200 mV, +300 mV), subsequently centrifuged, and filtrated (separated into dissolved and colloid phases). The filtrated samples were analyzed for total Hg (THg), MeHg, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), sulphate (SO42−), and chloride (Cl−). The colloidal phase was collected for TEM-EDX analysis. The sediment-phase was analyzed for Fe K-edge X-ray near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy, MeHg, phyto-available Hg, and for microbial communities. The increase of redox potential caused an increase of soil pH. Dissolved concentrations of THg, MeHg, Fe, Mn, DOC, and SO42− increased under reducing conditions, while Cl- increased under oxic conditions. The increase of THg concentration under reducing acidic conditions might be due to the reductive/acidic dissolution of Fe/Mn oxides, by which the sorbed Hg might be mobilized. The increase of MeHg concentration at low EH indicates an enhanced Hg methylation, likely due to the presence of Hg-methylation microorganisms such as Desulfitobacterium, as demonstrated by 16S rRNA sequences analysis. Also, the higher THg concentration might provide more inorganic Hg substrate for microbial methylation. The ln(MeHg/THg) ratio (Hg methylation potential) indicates the net production of MeHg normalized to total dissolved Hg (THg) concentration.

Here, we report the abundance and distribution of hgcAB genes using a combination of 3rd-generation PacBio sequencing, metagenomic and quantitative PCR analyses in several mine-impacted paddy soils from southwest China. We show that Hg methylating communities are diverse, with iron-reducing bacteria (i.e., Geobacter) and methanogens as the dominant taxa likely involved in Hg methylation in the soil. Phylogenetic analysis also uncovered some hgcAB sequences closely related to three novel Hg methylators, Geobacter anodireducens, Desulfuromonas sp. DDH964, and Desulfovibrio sp.

These findings shed new light on microbial community composition and major clades driving Hg methylation in rice paddy soils and have important implications in developing strategies for minimizing bioaccumulation of MeHg in rice grains and thus human exposure. Our findings also offer new insights into the biogeochemical factors controlling MeHg production and have the potential global implications for understanding the evolution and distribution of Hg(II) methylating microorganisms not only in paddy habitats but also other ecosystems such as wetlands.

Bernier-Latmania a Environmental Microbiology Laboratory, École Polytechnique Féderal de Lausanne, Switzerland. b Trace Element Speciation Group, University of Bern, Switzerland karen.viacava@epfl.ch Arsenic (As), one of the most toxic elements in the periodic table, is naturally present in the environment where it undergoes extensive microbial cycling. Because of the toxicity of this metalloid, resistance mechanisms developed by Archaean ancestors to thrive under the presence of reduced As during the earliest anoxic ecosystems have been preserved and are present today in many bacteria and archaea genes. An arsenite efflux pump system or the mechanisms for arsenate reduction or oxidation, to name a few. Arsenic methylation has been proposed as another resistance mechanism but also as an activation pathway or a precursor reaction for the synthesis of more complex arseno-organic molecules. It is a microbially-mediated process resulting in the addition of one or several methyl groups to inorganic As. The reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme arsenite methyltransferase (ArsM), generating volatile and non-volatile arsenicals. Rice, main staple food for millions of people worldwide, particularly efficient in accumulating arsenic represents one of the main sources of arsenic-exposure for humans. Methylated arsenic, in certain regions represents the predominant species present in rice. However, rice plants are not able to methylate As and soil microorganisms are the responsible mediators of this process. Several studies have been done to identify the main microbial drivers of As methylation by arsM sequencing and yet very few microbes have been confirmed as active As methylators by pure strains like the Bacteroidete Arsenicibacter rosenii SM-1 and the Firmicute Clostridium sp. BXM. Nonetheless, members of numerous other phyla present in soils harbor this gene and it is unclear whether all represent functional proteins and active methylating organisms. Thus, the goal of this study was to systematically probe the functionality and the in vivo activity of ArsM across different phyla in microorganisms isolated from or whose arsM gene has been found in paddy soils. By performing time-course experiments, we assessed the As resistance and the capacity for arsenite methylation and volatilization across seven microbial strains encoding the arsM gene: two archaea (Methanosarcina mazei Gö1, Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A); two Firmicutes (Anaeromusa acidaminophila DSM 3853, Clostridium pasteurianum DSM 525); a Streptomycete (Streptomyces vietnamensis DSM 41927); a Deltaproteobacterium (Geobacter metallireducens GS-15); and a Bacteroidete (Arsenicibacter rosenii SM-1). In addition, all arsM genes were cloned into the arsenic sensitive Escherichia coli AW3110(DE3) and As speciation performed. The results show that most of the strains were not able to methylate As despite harboring arsM genes that encode functional ArsM proteins. We hypothesize that more efficient As detoxification pathways might be prevalent, precluding methylation. We conclude that the presence of arsM does not equate As methylation activity and more work is undergoing to deconvolute arsM regulation.

Dimethylarsenate (DMAs) as the main product of As methylation can cause straighthead disease symptoms in rice plants. Notably, DMAs in rice is formed by microbes present in the soil as rice plants themselves cannot methylate arsenite (As(III)). Moreover, although dissolved organic matter (DOM) can change As activity and speciation in soils, whether DOM can affect As methylation and volatilization in paddy soils, and the performance of DOM with different origins remains unclear. In this study, we prepared DOM from different sources such as pig manure, cow dung, chicken manure, and rice straw and characterized their elemental composition and functional groups. The methyl As content in soil solution and the trapped volatile As from paddy soils following DOM application were analyzed. The abundance and community structure of the total bacteria and functional bacteria encoding arsenite S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (arsM) were observed using Illumina high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that pig manure and rice straw DOM exhibited the highest and lowest ability to methylate As with an efficiency of 18.6 and 10.0 µg methyl As g−1 total organic content in paddy soil, respectively. Based on the volatile As trapping device, the trapped As in paddy soils following pig manure DOM application was approximately 2.7- and 9.6-fold higher than that of soils treated with rice straw DOM and the control after 13 weeks of incubation, respectively. Specifically, trimethylarsenate, accounting for 54%, represented the highest trapped As species in silica beads. The copy number of the total and arsM bacteria was significantly enhanced in paddy soils treated with DOM. arsM copy number and methyl As content in paddy soils were significantly positively correlated (P Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Geobacter, Sphingomonas, Streptomyces, and Rhodopseudomonas capable of As reduction, methylation, or volatilization emerged largely in paddy soils following pig manure DOM addition. Additionally, numerous carboxyl (-COOH) groups were observed in the pig manure DOM, which facilitate the desorption of inorganic As from the soil colloid and increase of As methylation substrate. The relative abundance of aliphatic compounds with non-polar alkyl C and N-alkyl C functional groups in pig manure DOM supports the bacterial growth in paddy soils, as opposed to rice straw DOM that contains more aromatic compounds with aromatic C-O. In conclusion, DOM presenting different physicochemical characteristics can differentially promote As methylation and volatilization in paddy soils by changing the As methylation substrate and the abundance and community structure of arsM bacteria. These observations will provide a better understanding of DOM-mediated promotion of As methylation and volatilization in paddy soils.

Soils from Bangladesh were different in their OM content, soil reaction (pH), arsenic content and climatic conditions. The soils from USA were randomly from RICE facility at University of Delaware and from Arkansas. Fresh soils were used in the experiment at a rate of 100 g (oven dry basis at 70 oC). The soils were taken in 500 mL media bottle. The bottle caps were punctured to facilitate gas sampling and porewater collection. 150 mL water was added in the soils to keep the microcosm flooded during the entire period of the experiment. Rice straw was added in soil in each microcosms at a rate of 0.25% (w/w basis) and mixed it up with the soil. The two opposite punctures on the Media bottle caps were used to facilitate tubing into bottle for gas inlet and gas outlet. Both the inlet and outlet tubing arrangements and porewater collection using Rhizon sampler and trapping volatile arsenic species was conducted as described by Mestrot et al 2009 with a little modification. Briefly, ORBOTM Small Activated Silica Gel were impregnated with 1% AgNO3 (w/v) and dried in the oven overnight at 70 oC. For trapping volatile arsenic, AgNO3-impregnated silica gel tubes were fitted in the inlet and outlet tubing. The ambient air was pumped into the media bottle to refresh the headspace using an aquarium pump with a flow rate of 40 mL/min. Silica gel tube in the inlet tubing trapped volatile arsenic from the ambient air pumping into the incubation system to avoid arsenic contamination from ambient air and the silica gel tube on the outlet tubing trapped arsenic volatilized from the soil-water system in the microcosm. The experiment was continued for 60 days. Porewater was collected every two weeks and silica gel traps were collected at 30 and 60 days. Porewater was analysed for redox potential, pH, FeII, Si, total As, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Co, Cr, Ni, Cd and Pb. The traps were break open and the silica gels were collected and digested in the hot block at 95 oC using 1% Trace Metal Grade HNO3 (4.8 mL) and conc. H2O2 (0.2 mL). The digest was analysed for Total As and As speciation. All the 7 soils used in the experiment produced volatile arsenic. Even the lowest arsenic containing soils (3 mg/kg As) generated volatile arsenic above the LOD. Higher arsenic volatilization was observed in the microcosms treated at 30 oC compared to 20 oC for all the soils tested in the experiment. We can conclude from the experiment that temperature has potential for accelerating biovolatilization of arsenic from soil, which could be a potential arsenic bioremediation technique.

Zhaoa,b a College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, China b Rothamsted Research, UK 2016203014@njau.edu.cn Arsenic (As) is a toxic metalloid that is present ubiquitously in the environment. Due to mining and smelting, arsenic contamination is widespread in some paddy fields in southern China. Also, in these areas human are exposed to As mainly through rice. When paddy soils are flooded, the mobility of As and the capacity of As methylation are enhanced casuing dimethylarsenate (DMAs) to accumulate in the soil solution. However, DMAs can also be demethylated or volatilized by microbes. Demethylation and volatilization of DMAs from paddy soils were investigated in the present study. First, we incubated three paddy soils collected from different areas in China under flooded condition. During incubation, DMAs was produced in first two weeks and then disappeared. The addition of 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES), a specific inhibitor of methanogens, significantly decreased the abundance of methanogens and retarded the disappearence of DMAs. When exogenous DMAs was added to the three paddy soils, DMAs was demethylated into monomethylarsenic (MMAs) and inorganic As, which was inhibited by BES. Methanogens enrichment cultures were established from the three soils under anaerobic conditions. The enrichment cultures were able transform DMAs to As(III) and monomethylarsenate (MMAs). We synthesized 13C-DMAs using two enzymes in vitro, and added 13C-DMAs into the paddy soils. After incubated for 14 and 40 days, 13CH4 was detected in the headspace. These results indicate that methanogens play a major part in arsenic demethylation from DMAs. Secondly, we determined As volatilization from DMAs(V) added to two paddy soils. The addition of molybdate, a specific inhibitor of sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), greatly enhanced dimethylarsine (DMAs(III)H) evolution from DMAs(V). Molybdate addition significantly shifted the microbial community structure in two paddy soils. Aslo, a strain Bacillus sp. CZ-2 capable of ruducing DMAs(V) to DMAs(III)H was isolted from the soil used, and its volatilization ability was enhanced by Mo. This bacterial strain could not methylate As(III) or MAs(V). RNA-seq analysis identified 10 reductase genes upregulated by Mo in Bacillus sp. CZ-2, which may be involved in the reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III)H. Our results show that DMAs(III)H evolution from DMAs(V) is independent of the As methylation pathway, and that Mo enhances DMAs(III)H evolution from paddy soils by shifting the microbial community structure and enhancing the reduction of DMAs(V) to DMAs(III)H, possibly through upregulating the expression of DMAs(V) reductase gene(s).

Biomethylation of As is catalyzed by the enzyme arsenite (As(III)) S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM). To date, all identified ArsM orthologs with As(III) methylation activities have four conserved cysteine residues, which are thought to be essential for As(III) methylation. Here, we isolated an As(III)-methylating bacterium, Bacillus sp. CX-1, and identified a gene encoding a S-adenosylmethionine methyltranserase termed BlArsM with low sequence similarities (≤ 39%) to other ArsMs. BlArsM has six cysteine residues (Cys10, Cys11, Cys145, Cys193, Cys195 and Cys268), three of which (Cys10, Cys145 and Cys195) align with conserved cysteine residues found in most ArsMs. BlarsM is constitutively expressed in Bacillus sp. CX-1. Heterologous expression of BlarsM conferred As(III) resistance. Purified BlArsM methylated both As(III) and methylarsenite (MAs(III)), with a final product of dimethylarsenate (DMAs(V)). When all six cysteines were individually altered to serine residues, only C145S and C195S derivatives lost the ability to methylate As(III) and MAs(III). The derivative C10S/C11S/C193S/C268S was still active. These results suggest that BlArsM is a novel As(III) S-adenosylmethionine methyltransferase requiring only two conserved cysteine residues. A model of As(III) methylation by BlArsM is proposed.

China mengbo@vip.skleg.cn Rice paddy soil, as a typical ephemeral wetland, is known to be a significant environment for mercury (Hg) methylation. The methylation of inorganic mercury (IHg) in rice paddy soil constitutes a key step in the cycling of Hg in this special terrestrial ecosystem. An understanding of the factors that control the methylmercury (MeHg) production is necessary to underpin more reliable risk assessment and appropriate strategies to remediate contaminated soil. In this study, we compared the source and distribution of Hg species in different compartments of the rice paddy during a complete rice growing season at two different typical Hg-contaminated mining sites in Guizhou province, China: an abandoned site and a current-day artisanal site. In-situ specific methylation/demethylation rate constants in rice paddy soil were qualified using stable Hg isotope addition technique, simultaneously. The possible biogeochemical controls on MeHg production within the rice paddy ecosystem were further discussed in current study. Results showed that the dominant source of MeHg to paddy soil is in situ methylation of IHg. MeHg levels in rice paddy soil were a function of both methylation/demethylation processes and the net methylation potential in the rice paddy soil reflected the measured MeHg. Sulfate stimulating the activity of sulfate-reducing bacteria was a potentially important metabolic pathway for Hg methylation in rice paddies. Bioavailable Hg derived from new atmospheric deposition appears to be the primary factor regulating net MeHg production in rice paddies. We propose that the concentration of Hg in ambient air is an indicator for the risk of MeHg accumulation in paddy rice.

Theoretically, sulfidogenic process is an ideal bio-technology for low-cost treatment of Hg-contaminated wastewater because the biogenic sulfide can precipitate Hg(II) to form a safe byproduct – insoluble HgS (Ksp= 10-36 at 20 °C). However, most sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) can methylate Hg(II) to form neurotoxic methylmercury (MeHg) that accumulates in aquatic food webs, resulting in severe health hazards for human beings. Thus, conventional sulfidogenic processes driven by SRB are not suitable for mercury-contaminated wastewater treatment. In this study, we observed a novel finding that the long-term feeding of elemental sulfur for the cultivation of a sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB)-abundant seeding sludge, eliminated the mercury methylation potential but kept the sulfidogenic activities remained, with the enrichment of sulfur-reducing bacteria (S0RB) in the final microbial community. During the 6-month cultivation of S0RB from the SRB-abundant seeding sludge, the methylation capability of the S0RB-enriching sludge gradually diminished to a negligible level. When exposed to 5 mg/L Hg2+, no MeHg was produced (0RB-enriched sludge that cultivated for 6 months, while 1.49 μg/L MeHg accumulated in the SRB-enriched sludge. This finding was reproduced with a replicated cultivation work with a different seeding sludge, and the similar results were obtained. The sulfide production rate of the S0RB-enriched sludge and SRB-enriched sludge were 15.3 and 6.3 mgS/gVSS/h, respectively, showing that the long-term S0 feeding promoted the sulfidogenic activity. However, S0 feeding altered the microbial community, suppressed the growth of SRB and enriched S0RB, such as Geobacter, Sulfurospirillum and Pseudomonas. Interestingly, Geobacter that was identified as a known mercury-methylating genus, was the dominant genus in the S0RB-enriched sludge, and its relative abundance increased with the cultivation time. This is an unexpectedly finding, implying that the methylation ability of Geobacter could be hindered in the sulfur reduction system. Finally, we developed a biological sulfur reduction process driven by S0RB for mercury-contaminated wastewater, and investigated its long-term performance on mercury removal and MeHg accumulation. Receiving Hg-contaminated wastewater containing 0 – 50 mg Hg(II)/L for 326 days, S0RB in the sulfur reduction bioreactor removed 99.4%±1.4% of the influent Hg(II) by biogenic sulfide. MeHg was always found to be undetectable in the bioreactor, showing that the cultivated S0RB could be used for mercury-contaminated wastewater treatment without MeHg concern.

Thus the synthesis of arsenosguars represents a mechanism of arsenic detoxification. Arsenosugars also appear to play a central role in the pathway of arsenic biotransformation in marine systems. First, they are likely intermediates in the biosynthesis of the osmolyte arsenobetaine, which is the dominant arsenical in marine organisms and is nontoxic in humans. Second, arsenosugars are also the likely precursors of arsenosugar phospholipids, which may be components of the algal cell membrane. Incorporation of arsenolipids increases under low phosphate conditions and may represent a phosphate-sparing mechanism under those conditions. Arsenosugars were identified more than thirty years ago, and yet their mechanism of biosynthesis remains unknown. S-Adenosylmethionine methyltransferase (ArsM) from Synechocystis sp.

Predictive models of MeHg production is necessary to demonstrate the major controlling factors and the extent of Hg methylation in paddy soils. Samples of eighteen paddy soils with varying soil properties were spiked with inorganic mercury and subjected to a 90d flooding period in this work. Soil pH and Eh were measured in situ at intervals and soils were sampled for the analysis of MeHg. The methylation rate of mercury increased with flooding time and reached to a relatively steady state at 30d of incubation with range from 0.08% to 2.52%, and was significantly correlated with the in situ soil pH and Eh. The elovich equation could well describe the kinetic production of MeHg. The MeHg production could be well predicted by the in situ soil pH and Eh of the flooded soils, as well as the content of organic matter of air-dried soil samples and flooding time. The two predictive models explained 78% and 68% of the variability respectively.

Soil microbiota is an important player in assurance of soil functioning (nutrient cycling, organic matter decomposition, pollutants degradation, etc.). Hg methylation by soil microbiota plays a significant role in Hg global biogeochemical cycle and it should be considered. Generally, microorganisms are exposed mainly to bioavailable Hg in soil solution and fungi, but could be also through decomposing dead organic matter. At moment remained poorly understood the consequence on soil microbiota of exposure at different levels and forms of organic Hg. We presume that microbiota community structure and abundance could be changed as a consequence of exposure at organic forms of Hg, which in turn could alter soil functioning. In this study we used soil samples from a historically polluted site (Turda, Romania) with Hg, to assess Hg organic forms and their impact on soil microbiota community structure. To test our hypothesis, we performed also soil column experiments under controlled conditions (humidity, light exposure, etc.) and methylmercury exposure levels (5, 10, 25 and 50 µg⋅kg-1, respectively). PLFA approach was used to assess microbiota community structure and abundance. Enzymatic activities related with C (CM-cellulase, invertase) and N (urease, protease) cycling were assessed also, as key functions of soil.

Tippinga and A. Stockdaleb a Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, United Kingdom b Earth Surface Science Institute, University of Leeds, United Kingdom stlo@ceh.ac.uk It is a well-attested fact that the uptake and toxicity of cationic metals to organisms are dependent on the chemistry of the exposure medium. Considerable research effort has been devoted to development of modelling tools to understand, explain and predict these medium effects. Predominant among the developed models is the Biotic Ligand Model (BLM), which considers exposure to be directly related to metal bound to specific uptake sites (biotic ligands) on the target organism, with chemical speciation in the medium and competition for binding to the biotic ligand(s) accounted for. Similarly to the BLM, WHAM-FTOX is based around the concept of computing amounts of metal bound to the organism. However, rather than computing amounts of metals bound to assumed specific biotic ligands, WHAM-FTOX assumes that exposure to metals is proportional to the amount of metal bound by all weak-acid coordination sites on or in the organism, in equilibrium with the surrounding medium. An overall toxic response for mixtures of cations (metals and protons) is quantified as a toxicity function FTOX, given by FTOX = ∑ αi ϴi where the exposure to each cation is given by ϴi (the fractional occupancy of binding sites) and αi is a toxicity coefficient specific to each cation. Amounts of bound cations are computed using the WHAM chemical speciation model, taking the amounts bound to humic acid (HA) as proxies for amounts bound to organisms. This approach has the advantage that constants for cation binding are already available, rather than needing to be derived as with the BLM, and that mixture effects are readily computed. Furthermore, the toxic effects of proton binding can be included in the mixture exposure modelling. Initial applications of WHAM-FTOX focused on describing field community effects in freshwaters impacted by acidification and metal contamination in a number of locations including the UK and North America. Subsequent work has focused on modelling accumulation and mixture effects in laboratory toxicity tests. Most recently, the model has been used in a meta-analysis of single metal–single species laboratory toxicity data with the aim of providing a unifying picture of toxic effects through time and across metals and organisms. Collectively, this body of work demonstrates the utility of WHAM-FTOX as a unifying tool for understanding and predicting the toxicity of cation mixtures from the laboratory to the field, from single species to whole communities. Prospects for the future include the use of the model to predict mixture field effects based on calibration to laboratory data.

Peter G.C. Campbella, P. Couturea, C. Fortina, L. Harea and M. Rosabalb a INRS Eau Terre Environnement, Canada b Université du Québec à Montréal, Département des Sciences Biologiques, Canada Peter.Campbell@ete.inrs.ca For non-essential trace elements, the concept of a “critical body residue” or CBR has been explored over the years as a means of predicting whether or not the element is likely to exert deleterious effects on the host organism. However, aquatic organisms tend to accumulate metals in different forms, some of which remain internally bioavailable whereas others are detoxified; measures of total bioaccumulated metal ignore this phenomenon of subcellular metal partitioning. If the ratio of bioavailable to detoxified metal remains constant within the organism as metal exposure increases, then use of the CBR concept is appropriate. However, if the subcellular partitioning of the metal varies with metal exposure, then the critical body concentration approach no longer applies. Over the past 15+ years, we have investigated how aquatic organisms cope when exposed to non-essential metals such as silver, cadmium, nickel and lead. These metals normally enter living cells by facilitated transport, “fooling” the transmembrane transporters that are responsible for the influx of essential metals. Once inside the cell, the non-essential metals may be detoxified, for example by complexation with metallothionein or by sequestration in metal-containing granules. If detoxification is incomplete, these metals will be available to bind to metal-sensitive sites within the cell, such as enzymes or nucleic acids, potentially leading to deleterious effects. To determine whether metal detoxification has been effective or not, we have employed a two-pronged approach. The first step involves gentle cell rupture followed by differential centrifugation and heat denaturation, yielding five or more fractions: cellular debris; metal-rich granules; organelles; cytosol; heat-denatured cytosolic proteins (HDP); heat-stable cytosolic proteins (HSP). The HSP and granule-like fractions are normally considered to represent detoxified metal, whereas the HDP and organelle (e.g., mitochondria) fractions are classified as metal-sensitive fractions. The second step calls for the chromatographic separation of metal-ligand complexes present in the operationally-defined cytosol or the HSP fraction, to probe their chemical identity. This dual separation scheme has been used to compare the partitioning of different metals in a given species or of a specific metal across different species. In this communication, we compare the subcellular behaviour of metals in unicellular algae, an insect larva, a bivalve and several fish species. The algae were exposed under controlled conditions in the laboratory, whereas the animals were all collected in the field from contaminated sites representing metal contamination gradients. In all the field-collected animals, we were able to document a metal detoxification response involving the induction of metallothionein-like peptides (MTLP). Less frequently, the non-essential metal was sequestered in the granule-like fraction. The results show predictable differences between “soft” and “hard” cations, but for a given metal they also show inter-organ and subtle inter-species differences in the extent of metal detoxification. The implications of these findings for the application of the critical body residue approach will be discussed.

Among exposure pathways, dietary intake is an important contributor. In China, studies have shown elevated As, Cd, and Pb concentrations in dietary staples, including rice, wheat, and vegetable, threaten human health. Assessment of metal intake from food consumption is important to assess the associated health risk. However, dietary metal intake is often calculated using total concentration in foods without considering metal bioavailability. There are limited reports of metal bioavailability in foods, with the importance of incorporating metal bioavailability into human exposure assessment not being considered. In addition, the major factors that influence metal bioavailability in food matrices have not been evaluated, which help to develop mitigation strategies to decrease metal exposure in humans. We collected rice, wheat, and vegetable samples from markets across China, and from two contaminated sites of Yixing, Jiangsu and Chenzhou, Hunan. In vivo mouse bioassays were developed and applied to measure As, Cd, and Pb relative bioavailability (RBA) in food samples, which was incorporated into daily metal intake estimation and compared to internal metal exposure such as urinary and hair metals. Factors that contributed to variation in metal bioavailability among samples were identified, while the influences of mineral dietary supplements on metal relative bioavailability in rice was assessed. For rice samples from markets across China and contaminated sites, an in vivo mouse urinary As excretion method was developed to measure As-RBA. Overall, As-RBA in rice from both markets (44.5–87.5%, n=14) and contaminated sites (11–65%, n=11) varied considerably, with As speciation being the dominant contributor to the variability. As-RBA was positively correlated with inorganic As, but negatively correlated with organic As. To measure Cd and Pb RBA in food samples, an in vivo mouse liver and kidney assay was developed. Similarly, Cd-RBA varied considerably in rice (16.9–57.4%, n=10), wheat (37.4–67.6%, n=8), and vegetables (17.7–78.0%, n=6) from the Yixing site. Also, Cd- and Pb-RBA in rice (n=11) from the Chenzhou contaminated site were 41–84% and 11–59%. For residents living in the Yixing site, the predicted urinary Cd based on total Cd in rice was 3.5 times that of measured values, while incorporating Cd-RBA to assessing rice-Cd intake made the predicted and measured urinary Cd more closer, suggesting the importance of Cd-RBA in controlling Cd exposure. Subsequently, we determined the effectiveness of mineral dietary supplements to modulate Cd exposure, revealing that Ca dietary supplement was the most effective way to decrease Cd-RBA in rice, while high dietary intake of chloride could enhance Cd-RBA. Future population-based intervention studies should be conducted to show the effectiveness of dietary mineral supplement to decrease human Cd body burden. For residents living in the Chenzhou site, As, Cd, and Pb exposure via rice consumption was compared to that via housedust ingestion based on RBA. Interestingly, we observed that for adults, rice was the main As contributor, while housedust ingestion was the major As contributor to children. However, for both adults and children, rice was the main source for Cd exposure, while housedust was the predominant Pb contributor. This was confirmed by overlap of stable Pb isotopic composition between Pb in housedust and hair from residents, while Pb signals in rice was different from housedust Pb.

In most cases, the actual effect is not correlated with the chemically determined total metal content yet this is the criterion that is often used for regulatory purposes. A better estimation of effect relies on estimating metal speciation in solution, (i.e., how metal species interact with inorganic or organic ligands and how these species affect cellular targets); typically, this is achieved using electrochemical methods, multicomponent thermodynamic equilibrium speciation modelling, or a combination of both. These data are subsequently included in models such as the Biotic Ligand Model that is then used to predict metal toxicity. Following sequential extraction and chemical analysis, two experimental approaches are typically used to obtain information on the metal fraction that is bioavailable: i) uptake assays using algae or invertebrates; and ii) the use of microbial bioreporters. Microbes have evolved for billions of years in the presence of essential and toxic metals and have finely tuned strategies to maintain metal homeostasis, i.e., maintain an optimal intracellular level of essential metals, while removing toxic ones. At the cellular level, transcription regulators (i.e., metal sensing proteins controlling gene expression) and operator and promoter regions are part of the regulatory circuitry that controls microbial metal homeostasis and resistance. Bioreporters can be designed based on this regulatory circuitry and usually provide early detection, require little pre-treatment, offer increased sensitivity, can be tailored to be site-specific and are very cost effective. Numerous bacterial reporters have been created for the assessment of bioavailable metals and metalloids. Despite their great potential, however, the application of a biosensor developed in the laboratory to an environmentally relevant situation is rarely undertaken. This is often due i) to the lack of portability of the instruments required to detect and quantify the signal produced by the biosensors, ii) the inability of the biosensor physiology to adapt to environmental conditions relevant to metal speciation (e.g., anoxic environments) and iii) the presence of potential interferences in complex environmental mixtures due to variations in the affinity of metals to the sensor proteins. In this talk, I propose to review recent advances in the application of whole cell biosensors to environmental samples, offer alternatives to some of the issues currently preventing proper application of biosensors to environmental samples and use data generated in my laboratory to explore As and Hg biogeochemical cycles.

For health-oriented air pollution control, it is vital to rank the contribution of different emission sources according to the health risks posed by hazardous components in PM2.5, such as trace metals. In this study, we investigated the variations of PM2.5-associated metals from March 2016 to February 2017 in two densely populated regions of China - the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and the Pearl River Delta (PRD) across urban-suburban-rural gradients. The major emission sources of metals were evaluated by the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model, and quantitatively apportioned to the health risks on the basis of the concentrations of bioaccessible metals extracted by simulated lung fluids. The results showed that the particulate trace metal profiles reflected the land-use gradient within each region, with the highest concentrations of anthropogenically enriched metal (e.g., Cu, Pb, As, Cd, and Zn) at the suburban-industrial site of the YRD and at the semirural-industrial site of the PRD due to the urban and industrial activities.

This talk will describe how RBA is incorporated into health risk assessments and will provide an overview of the history of development of methods for testing metal RBA in soil. The early focus in the late 1980s was on use of animal models to test lead and arsenic RBA, followed soon after by the development of in vitro test systems. While animal studies have generally been considered the more reliable predictor of RBA in humans, differences in physiology and anatomy among animal species limit the accuracy of these models in predicting behavior in humans. Further, variations in toxicokinetics and other factors result in the need to apply different study designs to different metals. In vivo methods used to assess the bioavailability of soil-borne chemicals are typically modified versions of methods used historically in biomedical research. These methods have been modified to address constraints associated with use of doses relevant to environmental concentrations, the need to reflect weathering behavior in soils over time, and the need to generate data applicable to human health risk assessments. Lead and arsenic provide examples of such differences with arsenic being rapidly excreted in the urine, while lead accumulates in bone and has a much longer half-life in the body. Due to these differences, animal methods to calculate RBA differ for lead and arsenic. In contrast, a number of in vitro methods now in use have been validated by comparison with animal test results and are considered at least as reliable as animal studies. The prevailing methods in use in Europe, Canada, the United States and Australia will be described. Current in vitro methods for assessing lead and arsenic will be used to illustrate application of these models in risk assessment. Methods being applied to other metals will also be reviewed. While research and methods development effort has focused on evaluation of the relative bioavailability of lead and arsenic in soil, extension of these findings to other metals has been a subject of some debate. Factors that could affect applicable methods for a given metal include differences in toxicokinetics and toxic endpoints. Studies of the bioavailability of soil Cd, Cr, Ni and Hg will be described to illustrate a range of issues and approaches that are compared with approaches used for arsenic and lead.

Copper (Cu) is one of the metals with the highest risk due to its widespread contamination and its high toxicity. The effects of salinity on Cu toxicity have thus received much attention. However, generalizing the effects of salinity for risk assessment of Cu is still a challenge, mainly due to the complex effects of salinity and the substantial interspecies differences. In this study, we used the toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model as a unifying framework for simulating both the bioaccumulation and toxicity of Cu under various salinities and in three representative euryhaline species, i.e., a fish (Oryzias melastigma), a waterflea (Moina mongolica), and a clam (Potamocorbula laevis). The stable-isotope-tracer technique was used to measure the uptake and depuration of Cu in the organisms. At low Cu levels (10-20 μg L−1), Cu uptake rates generally decreased with the increase of salinity; at high Cu levels (~500 μg L−1), the inhibitive effects of salinity became less apparent, presumably due to the saturation of Cu uptakes sites. Nevertheless, different patterns were observed among species: non-monotonic change of Cu uptake was observed in the fish and waterflea, suggesting that the effects of salinity were more than geochemical effects. The effects of salinity on Cu bioaccumulation could not be directly translated into the effects on Cu toxicity; the lowest Cu toxicity was observed at intermediate salinities in all species. The decoupling between Cu bioaccumulation and toxicity was due to the changes in the intrinsic sensitivity of the organisms under different salinities, which could be measured by the two toxicodynamic parameters, i.e., the internal threshold concentration and the killing rate. The toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic model provides a method for separating and quantifying the multiple effects of salinity and thus can be served as a tool for better managing the risks of contaminants in the estuarine waters.

Recent studies show that Al could be beneficial to the growth of marine phytoplankton through facilitating the utilization of dissolved organic phosphorus, iron (Fe), and dinitrogen (N2). It can also influence the decay and decompostion of biogenic matter. On the basis of this knowledge, we have proposed the Iron-Aluminum Hypothesis, which proposes that Al, through enhancing carbon fixation in the upper ocean, and facilitating the export and sequestration of the fixed carbon to ocean depths, could play an important role in the ocean carbon cycle and climate change. In this presentation, I will talk about our new results on the uptake and subcellular distribution of Al in marine phytoplankton, and the effects of Al on the carbon fixation of four marine phytoplankton species (three diatoms and one cyanobacterium) and the decay of the fixed organic carbon by using radiocarbon (14C). Our results provide strong evidence that marine diatoms can take up and internalize Al into their cells, with a rate comparable to the internalization flux of Fe to the same diatom. Once being assimilated, Al was partitioned to subcellular components in the following order: granules (69 ± 5%) > debris (17 ± 4%) > organelles (12 ± 2%) > heat-stable peptides (HSP) (~2%) > heat-denaturable proteins (HDP) (Thalassiosira pseudonana, 15%–20% for T. oceanica, 15%–23% for T. weissflogii and 6%–13% for Trichodesmium erythraeum). More importantly, our results for the first time showed that the presence of environmentally relevant concentrations (40 nM to 200 nM) of Al could significantly reduce the decay and decomposition of the phytoplankton-produced organic carbon in seawater media (up to 21%–57% for T. pseudonana, 2%–28% for T. oceanica, 29%–58% for T. weissflogii, and 28%–57% T. erythraeum).

The bread increased the bioaccessibility of Pb in PbCO3-contaminated soil in the intestinal phase, but the decreased bioaccessibility of Pb was observed in the gastric phase after the steamed bread was added. The decrease was attributed to the formation of Pb phosphate precipitates However, in the soil contaminated with free Pb2+ or sorbed Pb forms, the steamed bread increased the Pb bioaccessibility in both gastric and intestinal phases. This was probably due to the higher dissolved organic carbon induced transformation of Fe/Mn oxides-sorbed Pb into soluble Pb-organic complex. Addition of spinach into the two soils reduced the Pb bioaccessibility in both gastic and intestinal phases.

In situ stabilization of contaminants in soil can be achieved through addition of soil amendments. Over the past 9 years, we studied the manipulation of bioaccessibility of soil contaminants in urban brownfields and yard soils via in situ soil amendments and contaminant uptake by food crops grown on several urban brownfield sites slated for community gardens throughout the U.S. The challenges in stabilizing the contaminants via treatments in urban brownfields soils are heightened by unique soil characteristics, poor soil quality, and the presence of co-contaminants. The most common soil contaminant at the brownfields sites and the tested yard soils was lead. We also found elevated arsenic and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at one or more of our test sites. Our research indicates that the potential exposure pathway of concern is the direct exposure of humans to contaminated soils. The pathway from contaminated soil to plant to human is insignificant. Our research has also shown that, in general, concentrations of lead, arsenic, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in vegetables harvested at test sites were low and contaminants can be diluted by the addition of clean compost. However, the concentrations of contaminant uptake appear to be highly dependent upon soil and other site-specific characteristics. Compost additions help reduce contaminant concentrations in vegetables. Our results indicated that most of the lead and arsenic in soils were not bioaccessible (measured by modified physiologically based extraction test developed by Ruby et al. 1996). In general, soil treatments further reduced bioaccessibility of lead and arsenic, although, these reductions were not always significant. Detailed investigations of the changes in speciation of soil contaminants using X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicated a lack of clear changes in speciation except when the mixtures of soil amendments were added or the ageing of the soil-treatment mixture had occurred. For mildly contaminated soils, a better understanding of underlying mechanisms responsible for the effectiveness of traditionally used in situ stabilization treatments for soil contaminants as well as new and/or improved in situ treatments in the presence of co-contaminants is needed. This understanding will help in developing more practical, safe, and cost-effective alternatives for dealing with the wide-spread, low levels of soil contamination in the U.S. and around the world.

However, low-molecular-weight (LMW) weak ligands such as cysteine have been shown to enhance metal uptake in the presence of strong ligands by marine phytoplankton, but the effect is not observed in freshwater. We hypothesize that these contrasting results are due to the large differences in ambient Ca concentrations and metal-ligand exchange kinetics between marine and freshwaters; specifically, free metal ions newly liberated from LMW-metal complexes in the boundary layer surrounding algal cells (phycosphere) cannot be immediately sequestered in seawater by the metal buffer (which is largely bound to Ca or Mg), but can be rapidly complexed in fresh waters where free or protonated forms of the metal buffer are more available. In the present work, short-term Cd uptake experiments at different Ca concentrations with a model freshwater alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) and a marine alga (Thalassiosira weissflogii) consistently support our proposed hypothesis. At constant concentrations of bulk Cd2+ buffered by a strong ligand: 1) in artificial freshwater with addition of seawater levels of Ca, Cd uptake by high-Ca pre-acclimated C. reinhardtii cultured with cysteine as the N source (to enhance local Cd2+ liberation via cysteine degradation) in the presence of cysteine was 2.2-fold higher than that in the absence of cysteine; 2) in the artificial freshwater but at a low Ca concentration, the enhancement was not observed in cysteine-acclimated C. reinhardtii; 3) at seawater levels of Ca, the enhancement disappeared as well when the high-Ca pre-acclimated C. reinhardtii were cultured with ammonium as the N source (to inhibit cysteine degradation and local Cd2+ liberation); and 4) in artificial seawater, when the total concentration of free/protonated strong ligand was higher than that of the Cd-cysteine complexes, the Cd uptake rate by T. weissflogii that had been cultured with cysteine did not change after addition of cysteine. These results suggest that the phycosphere effect could potentially increase metal toxicity or improve nutrition of essential trace metals such as Fe, Zn and Cu, neither of which can be predicted solely on the basis of the chemistry of the ambient bulk water.

With the UK Environment Agency lowering the blood Pb level (BLL) used in the derivation of recommended ‘safe‘ soil guideline values to 3.5 µg/dL in 2014, the Newcastle Allotments Biomonitoring Project was initiated. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the BLL of gardeners compared to their non-gardening neighbours along with a range of related and confounding variables. Soil, crops and participants blood and saliva samples were collected. Gardeners blood lead levels (BLL) ranged from 0.6 – 4.1 ug/dL. Percentage bioaccessibilities (and geomean total soil Pb), ranged from 32%–76% (338 mg/kg). Pb uptake in crops varied with crop type, highlighting soil plant concentration factors (SPCFs) as a key driver of exposure in urban gardening. Crops suitable for growing at allotments with elevated Pb were tubers, shrub and tree fruit with observed mean Pb concentrations 0.1 mg/kg FW. The extent to which the soil Pb is available for crop uptake, and the bioaccessibility, can be understood in terms of the solid-phase partitioning of the Pb following application of the Chemometric Identification of Substrates and Element Distribution protocol (CISED). The CISED extraction identifies the main acid soluble substrates in the soil and the fractionation of the Pb between them. This information is used in conjunction with soil properties to provide a holistic overview of the factors controlling the mobility of lead in the three allotment sites. The CISED mineral acid extractable Pb is between 75-85% for all soils. The majority of the soils show a dominating Pb component which also contains Al and P and suggests the presence of the mineral plumbogummite (PbAl3(PO4)2(OH)5·H2O). After weathering, Pb entering into soil from different Pb sources forms plumbogummite as a stable end point. Despite plumbogummite having low aqueous solubility these findings suggest it is the main source of bioaccessible Pb in these soils. Our work highlights the need to model exposure of specific sub-populations (such as urban gardeners) if we are to provide a robust, relevant and applicable soil screening value for soil Pb at such sites. This is essential if we are to provide confidence to regulators, who must decide on the suitability of a site, but also to the residents.

Previous research focused on soil ingestion as the main exposure pathway but other exposure pathways (i.e. inhalation) should be considered to assess human health risks. It is well known that particulate matter (PM) can be generated following wind erosion or anthropogenic activity near contaminated soils. In the present study, ten field-collected chromated copper arsenate (CCA)-contaminated soils and associated particulate matter (PM) were characterized for their total metal content (As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) and physicochemical properties. Copper, Ni, Pb and Zn fractionation and inhalation bioaccessibility of all metals were assessed in PM20 samples and in certified reference soil BGS 102. In Gamble’s solution, low bioaccessibility was observed for all metals. A strong correlation (r=0.92, p AA). Mobile Cu fractions were deemed to be the main factor influencing OPAA (F1 (r = 0.99, p AA. This being said, obtained results are not sufficient to conclude on an association between in vivo PM-induced oxidative stress and Cu inhalation bioaccessibility. The use of an in vitro cellular OP assay could help verify this assumption.

Pereiraa, A. Pellegrinob and Beverley Halea aSchool of Environmental Sciences, University of Guelph, Canada bMTE, Canada bhale@uoguelph.ca Rare earth elements (REEs) is a group of 17 trace elements including the lanthanide series, yttrium and scandium. They co-occur naturally in mineral deposits, have similar properties, and are being used increasingly in new technologies. At low concentrations in soils, plant growth can been stimulated by REEs; at higher concentrations, toxicity has been identified for some REEs. Good data for setting soil quality guidelines for REEs are scant, specifically in the consideration of REE bioaccessibility in soils, and how that might influence toxicity. Existing legislation and guidelines for metal ecotoxicity in soils are generally set at total concentration in soil, with the recognition that the total embraces metal species that are scantly unavailable to plants, microorganisms or soil fauna. In some jurisdictions, site specific soil quality guidelines could be created, including considerations of bioavailability. Bioaccessibility can be either directly measured or predicted from soil characteristics; the goal of this work was to measure bioaccessibilities of Ce, Eu and Nd in soil directly, and validate these estimates with measurement of accumulation in plants. Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and CaCl2 batch extraction were used to directly measure Ce, Nd and Eu bioaccessibilities in an organic soil augmented with these REEs in concentrations ranging from 0 to 7500 mg/kg. Extraction of soil REEs with CaCl2 measures their instantaneous bioaccessibility, whereas DGT integrates the diffusive process of a plant roots over time. Fourteen-day pot studies in this same soil allowed determination of toxicity thresholds (shoot/root length) and tissue accumulation for these three REEs, for radish, tomato and durum wheat. Both methods of determining bioaccessible soil REEs showed linear correlations to the total concentration within the tested range. Bioaccessible REE concentrations determined by CaCl2 extraction were very low – less than 0.05% of the total measured concentrations. Depletion of the labile pool of REEs in the soil was observed with prolonged exposures and required metal resupply by soil mixing or repotting into fresh soil. This might not be needed in soils with a plant canopy that creates bulk flow of water through the soil, thus replenishing the supply of trace elements at the root. This is a consideration for using the DGT as a companion to long-term plant studies of REE uptake and toxicity. Hormesis was not observed for any of the three plant species, growing with any of the three REEs. Many, but not all, endpoints had identifiable toxicity thresholds within the concentration range tested: EC10 for root or shoot length varied from 8000 mg/kg, depending on the species and the REE. These ECs were much higher than previously reported in another study using OECD soils. Normalizing the ECs from these two studies for bioaccessibility of REEs in soil resulted in toxicity thresholds that were more similar, demonstrating the importance of considering bioavailability in soil quality guidelines for REEs.

Successful application of the fungi depends on their tolerance to heavy metals. Pb is the one of the most common heavy metals in contaminated environments. We hence explored the mechanisms of lead tolerance between two typical filamentous fungi, A. niger and P. oxalicum. The mechanisms of reducing the Pb toxicity by the two fungi have three major pathways. First, secreted oxalic acid reacts with Pb (II) to form insoluble Pb minerals. Second, the enhanced biosorption via new border of cell wall could prevent Pb (II) transported into hypha. Finally, fungal activity could be maintained even at high Pb concentration due to the intracellular accumulation. Moreover, A. niger has the higher Pb tolerance (up to 1500 mg/L Pb level) compared with P. oxalicum (up to 1000 mg/L). Pb levels below 1000 mg/L partially stimulate the bioactivity of A. niger, which is confirmed by its elevated respiration (from 53 to 63 mg C L-1 medium h-1). This subsequently enhanced some functions of A. niger to resist Pb toxicity. A better understanding of Pb tolerance of these two fungi sheds a bright future of applying them to remediate lead-contaminated environments.

Ireland and Louise Meunier Chemical Engineering Department, Queen’s University, Canada Louise.Meunier@queensu.ca Humans are exposed to silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) through an ever-expanding array of consumer and industrial products. Because of their anti-bacterial properties, AgNPs are imbedded in applications ranging from keyboards and cosmetics, to sports garments, wound dressings, and medical devices. AgNPs are also used as a catalyst in fuel cells or as a fuel additive. This emergence increases exposure to this compound of potential concern, and the associated risks to human heath must be characterized. The present work focusses on the inhalation pathway and human exposure to spherical AgNPs with a diameter of 25 nm, which are commonly used in wound dressings. Inhalation conditions were set to represent the typical breathing of an adult male exposed to guideline concentrations of AgNPs of 10 micrograms per cubic meter (National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety). Computational fluid dynamics models of the inhalation pathway were generated using COMSOL Multiphysics to estimate the flux of AgNPs in aspirated air, in lung fluid, and through alveolar epithelium. In parallel to this in-silico study, a series of bioaccessibility tests were conducted in vitro to estimate the physico-chemical behaviour of AgNPs in simulated lung fluids using a modified Physiologically-Based Extraction Test (PBET). The resulting solutions were then placed in a Parallel Artificial Membrane Permeability Assay (PAMPA) to estimate the concentration of silver in solution and the number of AgNPs in the permeate. PBET and PAMPA extracts were analysed using Inductively-Coupled Plasma – Mass Spectrometry and by Scanning Electron Microscopy. The COMSOL simulations reached steady state within 100 seconds, at which point results showed an average flux of 3.5 E-19 moles AgNPs per square meter per second.

It is well recognized that the bioavailability of As to rice roots and subsequent translocation to the shoots and grains is governed by the biogeochemical conditions in rice rhizosphere. Increasing applications of nanotechnology-enhanced agrichemicals have the potential to significantly alter the biogeochemical conditions in rice rhizosphere and affect As bioavailability. However, few studies have explored the effects of these agrichemicals on plant uptake and speciation of As in plant tissues. Using two popular ENPs in agricultural applications, cerium oxide nanoparticles (CeO2 NPs) and zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs), and two inorganic species of As, arsenite (As(III)) and arsenate (As(V)), we investigated their mutual effects on plant metal uptake and accumulation in a hydroponic system. The results indicated that ZnO NPs significantly reduced both the As(III) and As(V) specie in rice roots and shoots, regardless of the oxidation state of the initial As supplied to plants. The decrease of As(III) content in rice roots is particularly remarkable when As was initially provided as As(V). In contrast, CeO2 NPs demonstrated a much milder effect on As plant accumulation. Neither the total As nor the As speciation was significantly influenced by CeO2 NPs. Alternatively, the co-presence of As did not affect the plant uptake of Zn from ZnO NPs, but increased Ce in rice shoots in the treatment containing CeO2 NPs together with As(III). In summary, we have observed active interactions between two metallic ENPs and co-existing inorganic As species in rice tissues, and the extent of their interactions depend on the properties of ENPs as well as the initial oxidation state of As.

Kochoni INRS Eau Terre Environnement, Canada claude.fortin@ete.inrs.ca Understanding metal interactions with aquatic organisms is a key step to answer many questions about their nutritional importance, their accumulation and their toxicity. The Biotic Ligand Model (BLM) is a tool commonly used today to predict and quantify metal bioavailability for aquatic organisms. According to this paradigm, metal uptake and toxicity is determined by the binding of metal ions to key surface binding sites (biotic ligands) that will lead to internalisation. The extent of metal binding to biotic ligands depends on metal speciation (dissolved ligands compete with biotic ligands for metal binding) and on the presence of background cations such as calcium, magnesium and protons (cations and metals compete for binding with the biotic ligands).In recent years, metal mixtures have been investigated to identify antagonistic or synergistic effects. These studies usually examine the impact of two or more non-essential elements. However, little attention has been paid to the role of essential trace elements on the toxicity of another element. In this work, we examined if the use of low concentrations of essential elements (Co, Mn, Zn and Fe) modified the response of a freshwater green alga (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) to copper. To do so, we followed cell growth over 72 h in exposure media where the essential element concentrations were manipulated. Among these elements, iron proved to have a strong impact on the cells’ response to copper. Dose-response curves showed that free Cu2+ concentrations required to inhibit cellular growth by 50% (IC50) over 72 h decreased from 2 nM in regular Fe medium ([Fe3+] = 10-17.6 M) to 4 pM in low iron medium ([Fe3+] = 10-19.0 M); a 500-fold increase in toxicity. These results show clearly that iron plays a protective role against copper toxicity to C. reinhardtii. This assertion is consistent with the results of Cu accumulation inside the algae during their exposures to Cu2+ under both low and regular iron conditions. From the accumulation curves, it appeared that, at low Cu2+ concentrations (pCu ~13.0 to pCu 10.5), Cu accumulation inside C. reinhardtii increases under low iron conditions but remain relatively stable under regular iron conditions. In this range of [Cu2+], copper accumulation reached up to ~150 amol·cell-1 representing a 6-fold increase compared to that observed in algal cells grown in the regular iron medium. This last result confirms the plausible existence of protective effect of Fe3+ against Cu2+ uptake in C. reinhardtii. This protective role could partly be explained by the antagonistic effects between Fe3+ and Cu2+ at the binding sites of metals on the cell surface (i.e. BLM) but possibly also by a feedback mechanism linked to iron nutrition. We hypothesise that at low iron conditions, the cells increase the number and/or the affinity of iron transporters and that copper is internalised via this uptake mechanism, resulting in higher copper uptake and toxicity. In freshwaters, as opposed to marine waters, iron is always abundant. The expected free iron concentrations in surface waters can vary between 10-14 to 10-20 M, depending on pH (e.g. when pH increases from 6 to 8). We conclude that copper toxicity in natural waters can be modulated by iron geochemistry and that, in some conditions, the BLM may need to be further developed to account for the influence of iron.

Zhhwang1979@163.com Alga are widely distributed in aquatic ecosystems and play an important role in arsenic (As) bioavailability and biogeochemical cycling. As one of important freshwater algae, Microcystis aeruginosa is generally tolerant to As(V) and exhibits a stronger As bioaccumulation capacity compared to other freshwater algae. Many abiotic factors affect the metabolic functions of alga contaminated by As, such as As levels, hydrogen ion levels (pH), and key nutrient concentrations of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in culture media. To date, very limited information is available on how and to what extent environmental factors influence arsenic (As) biotransformation and release in freshwater algae. To further understand environmental factors that impact As(V) bioaccumulation, we investigated As bioavailability and biotransformation in M. aeruginosa, aspects of its growth, intracellular As accumulation in algae cells, and release after algae death. Also, we examined the influences of three different DOP forms (β-sodium glycerophosphate (βP), adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) and D-Glucose-6-phosphate disodiumsalt (GP)) and inorganic P of phosphate (IP) on As(V) toxicity, accumulation and biotransformation in Microcystis aeruginosa. We found that N is critical for M. aeruginosa As(V) biotransformation to occur, particularly with regard to As(III) transformation. Also, As accumulation benefited from low P levels when combined with high N concentrations. Phosphate was second to As(V) as the primary factor to affect As accumulation. Additionally, we found that the small amounts of As that accumulated under low concentrations of As and high P were tightly stored in living algal cells and were easily released after cell death. Meanwhile, arsenic accumulation in algal cells were thus greatly enhanced under DOP conditions especially βP since there was highest intracellular TP under βP treatment. Furthermore, As(V) reduction and subsequent As(III) methylation was greatly facilitated in M. aeruginosa by DOP, particularly GP, which confirmed by its higher relative expression of two functional genes including arsC and arsM. Furthermore, higher P distribution in MSF under IP treatment could explain that the tested algae have lower toxic stress compared to DOP treatments. Meanwhile, higher MSF distribution of As in M. aeruginosa under DOP conditions can explain higher toxicity with lower 96 EC50 values. Our results will be helpful for the understanding, practical applications, and overall control of the key environmental factors, particularly those associated with algal bioremediation for As-polluted water.

As one of important freshwater algae, Microcystis aeruginosa have been identified for their high heavy metal and As accumulation rates and their possible usage for water treatment. Ongoing research shows the potential of this organism for removing As as well as important process parameters related of the organism for accumulation and detoxification by means of transformation to less toxic inorganic or methylated As species. Additionally, when using coagulation technology to remove As-loaded algae from the water phase, there parameters should be optimized including pH, coagulant types, arsenic levels. Meanwhile, additional budget should be allocated to the management of the toxic sludge produced since precipitated M. aeruginosa may to a certain extent release As again into the water phase (in situ or ex situ disposal). Thus, environmental safety of the coagulation technology itself should be assessed prior to its use, which has not yet been done so far. In particular, changes in As content and As speciation in As-loaded M. aeruginosa were not addressed clearly after in-situ or ex-situ disposal in water phases after algal coagulation and precipitation. We thus investigated changes of As concentrations and its species in the in-situ treated algae water by optimal coagulation and As release kinetics from its subsequent living and dead precipitated algae after ex-situ disposal. Results showed that the optimal coagulation treatment for removing algae was 25 mg/L PACl, 1.0 µM arsenate (As(V)), and pH 6.0, whereby we attained greater than 99.5% algal removal efficiency. Moreover, in the in-situ treated water, total dissolved As slowly decreased as standing for 6 days, but arsenite (As(III)) largely increase after 3 days standing. Additionally, potential risks arised from As release in short-term duration (24 h) from both living and dead precipitated algae at 1.0 μM As(V) pre-exposure due to their higher release rate constants. Similarly, As release in long-term (6 d) duration from dead alga at 10.0 µM As(V) pre-exposure also resulted in potential risks. Moreover, As release from precipitated M. aeruginosa depends not only on As content in the algae but also on the status – living or dead – of the algae while being disposed ex-situ.

Tl can be released to the environment during coal mining, processing and use in coal-fired power plants and other coal based industrial processes, and through refining processes of ores for other metals such as copper, gold, lead, uranium, and zinc. For the past decades, Tl has been developed as a tracer to investigate paleo-oceanographic processes as well as geochemical cycles in the modern ocean. However, up to date, the roles of biology in the Tl cycle have seldom been considered. Here we present dose-response data from various families of phytoplankton to a wide range of Tl concentrations (1 ng/L to 1 mg/L). Growth rates, the maximum yield of photochemistry of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), the functional absorption cross-section of photosystem II (σPSII), and the change of whole metallome have been analysed. Of all phytoplankton studied here, cyanobacteria (Synechococcus) have the largest tolerance to Tl toxicity, whereby growth was even stimulated at high Tl concentration (1mg/L). Haptophytes, especially isochrysidales, accumulated significantly more Tl intracellularly than chlorophytes. Tl+ can be mistakenly imported for the chemically similar K+. Potassium transporters of various phytoplankton have also been identified from their genome using a novel orothogroup inference algorithm (OrthoFinder), and singular value decomposition (svd) analysis of potassium transporters data provides a fundamental framework to understand the contrasting bioaccumulation of Tl among different lineages. The potassium transporters from E. huxleyi are significantly different from all other phytoplankton in this study. Indeed, E. huxleyi accumulated most Tl available in the media at enviromental relevant concentrations (up to 100 ng/L). Based on the data in this study, under the average Tl concentration in seawater (10 ng/L), E. huxleyi can accumulate 1.6 µg Tl per g organic C produced by this organism. E. huxleyi is one of the most widely distributed phytoplankton, and considering massive yearly blooms of this species which cover an average of 1.4 × 106 km2 surface water, Tl cycles in those area should be largely affected.

In addition to this aquatic food chain pathway, recently, considerable levels of MeHg have been found in rice, particularly in contaminated areas, and thus rice consumption could act as another major pathway for human exposure to MeHg. The occurrence of elevated levels of MeHg in rice may suggest that rice products, such as infant rice cereals, could contain the MeHg being transferred from the rice used during the manufacture processes. Analysis of infant cereals commonly marketed in the United States and China suggests that some rice cereals do contain elevated levels of MeHg and total Hg (THg), posing potential health risks as infants could consume rice cereals as a major fraction of their diets. For a more accurate evaluation of the potential health risks to infants caused by consumption of rice cereals, the bioaccessibility of MeHg in the rice cereals was assessed using physiologically based extraction methods. An in vitro gastrointestinal extraction method was employed to determine the bioaccessibility of MeHg in rice-based infant cereals and to examine the factors controlling the MeHg bioaccessibility. The fractions of MeHg in infant cereals extracted into the dissolved phase (digestive juice) by simulated gastrointestinal fluids ranged from 25% to 74%. However, it seems that MeHg, even after being released from the solid matrices, could be re-adsorbed onto the undigested sample residues during the course of extraction, which may obstruct the accurate evaluation of the bioaccessibility of MeHg in the samples. For the purpose of comparison, fish samples were extracted using the same in vitro method to evaluate the bioaccessibility of MeHg in fish.

For in vitro bioaccessibility method development, we collected house dust samples from uncontaminated areas across China and Pb/Zn mining areas, Hunan, China. In vivo mouse bioassays were applied to measure As, Pb, and Cd relative bioavailability (RBA), which were compared to bioaccessibility measured using in vitro assays including SBRC, IVG, DIN, PBET, and UBM to determine the most suitable in vitro method as a surrogate of animal bioassays. In addition, bioavailability/bioaccessibility measurement was coupled with the stable isotope ratio technique to identify dominant exposure pathway for children with elevated blood Pb living in Zhuhang, China, a town characterized with intensive wire rope production and residents living in mining/smelting districts, Hunan, China. For house dust from uncontaminated areas, Pb and As RBA was 29–60% and 22–87% based on in vivo mouse blood assay. When validated against in vivo RBA data, SBRC and DIN methods had the strongest potential to predict As and Pb bioavailability in the dust samples. However, for contaminated house dust, As and Pb RBA (7.64–37% and 7.21–52.1%) based on mouse liver and kidney assay was significantly lower, with Cd RBA being firstly reported to be 20.3–94.3%, suggesting the influences of contamination source on metal(loid) bioavailability. Among bioaccessibility methods, the single gastric phase of the UBM method could be used to predict bioavailability of co-contaminants in house dust from mining/smelting areas. For children in Zhuhang, when stable isotopic composition of children blood Pb was compared to that of total Pb in the environmental medias (house dust, soil, PM10, vegetables, rice, and drinking water), there was no match between blood Pb and Pb in any environmental media. However, when determined for bioaccessible Pb using the SBRC method, Pb isotopic composition in house dust showed a close agreement with blood Pb, suggesting that coupling stable isotope technique and bioavailable Pb analysis provided a more robust approach for identifying Pb exposure pathways than total Pb determinations.

In order to verify this hypothesis, the effect of As on the EPS synthesis of one cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC6803 (PCC) and one green microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was investigated. In addition, we determined the As adsorption, absorption and speciation in the two strains with and without EPS upon different As treatments (Synechocystis PCC6803: 0-500 µM AsIII and AsV; C. reinhardtii: 0-10 mg L-1 AsIII and 0-200 µg L-1 AsV). Results showed that the EPS yield of Synechocystis PCC6803 was significantly increased with addition of As in the medium and the amount was significantly higher in response to As(III) than As(V) treatment. The cyanobacterial cells with EPS accumulated up to 8 % and 30 % more As(III) and As(V) than the EPS-removed cells, along with absorption capacity of 596.57 µg g-1 DW of As(III) and 751.17 µg g-1 DW of As(V) respectively. Adsorption and oxidation/reduction of As(III) and As(V) by the PCC6803 cells were also significantly higher in the presence of EPS. In comparison, there were no significant impact of EPS on the concentration of As in the C. reinhardtii cells. The synthesis of EPS was not affected by the As treatments either. However, after the removal of EPS, As adsorption on the cell surface increased and much less AsV was reduced to AsIII. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) analyses revealed that the EPS of both strains was enriched with functional groups such as C-O-C, NH, and OH, suggesting that the EPS could contribute to accumulation and redox transformation of As in the microalgal cells and they have potential to be applied in the As bioremediation in aquatic environments. Nevertheless, the roles of individual components of EPS (e.g., polysaccharides, proteins, etc.) in the As accumulation and transformation and mechanism for the EPS synthesis in the microalgae under As stress still require further studies.

Poulaina a Biology Department, University of Ottawa, Canada b Université de Toulon, Aix Marseille Univ, CNRS, IRD, MIO, France martin.pothier@uottawa.ca Arsenic (As) is a naturally-occurring group A carcinogen found in food, water and soils worldwide. There is a growing body of evidence pointing towards dissolved organic matter (DOM) as being a key player in the control of arsenic redox state, mobility and toxicity. Yet, no known study has directly quantified DOM effects on the fraction of arsenic available to bacteria. Because of its demonstrated binding affinity to As, we hypothesized that DOM serves as a strong predictor of As bioavailability. Using an As-specific biosensor, we tested our hypothesis by altering environmental variables affecting the affinity of As to DOM, namely DOM photoreactivity, As-DOM complex age, ionic strength and DOM origin selected for its sulphur content. First, in the presence of DOM, we demonstrated that As bioavailability was affected by DOM concentration, the age of the As-DOM complex and by the presence of divalent cations. We showed that DOM differentially affected the bioavailability of As(III) and As(V) and that bioavailable concentrations of both inorganic As species were reduced by up to 83% in the presence of environmentally relevant levels of calcium (10 mM), likely a result of cationic bridging (As-Ca-DOM). Here, DOM aromaticity, sulphur and carboxyl content appeared to control the extent of As species uptake. Second, the combination of the biosensor and ICP-MS measurements revealed that As(III) was readily photooxidized regardless of the presence of DOM, and that changes in ionic content greatly affected the extent of As(III) photooxidation in the presence of DOM. Our results are the first to reveal the control that DOM exerts on As(III) and As(V) bioavailability to bacteria. We emphasized the complex role that DOM plays in arsenic photoreactivity and its consequences on As bioavailability. Our work is relevant to understand the biogeochemistry of arsenic in the context of on-going environmental changes such as prolonged seasonal irradiation, seasonal redox fluctuations and As cycling in ground/surface waters with high organic matter content and high ionic strength.

This information will aid in predicting the bio-availability of the toxic element and will also help in describing its fate in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. A site-specific soil adsorption model was developed that would estimate the amounts of soluble Cu and Ni in representative acidic soils from Sudbury, Ontario, a historical mining region of Canada. Binding constants for Cu and Ni with organic matter and clay were determined experimentally while the binding constants for the dissolved species and with iron oxides were taken from available literature values. The models were validated by comparing determined values of dissolved Cu and Ni with those predicted by the adsorption models. The models fit all the data well, except for some soils where the fit was not as good at pH values above approximately 6.0. The models were tested by investigating Ni and Cu concentrations in a number of plant bio-receptors from the Sudbury area and correlating these concentrations against three alternative ways of estimating the metal concentrations in the soils - the total concentration as determined in an aqua-regia extract (Total soil Cu and Ni); the soluble concentration at pH 2 (Bio-accessible soil Cu and Ni); and the concentration of soluble Cu and Ni as estimated by the soil adsorption models (Modeled soil Cu and Ni). Naturally occurring plant sample were taken from transects around three smelters. The regression coefficients for the pooled Ni and Cu concentrations in these plant samples showed a consistent improvement from Total soil Cu and Ni to Bio-accessible soil Cu and Ni to Modeled soil copper. A range of garden vegetables were also sampled and Ni concentrations compared with the three methods of measuring soil Ni. Results were similar to those for the naturally occurring plant samples for Ni. These results indicated that the soil adsorption models represent a significant improvement over the concentrations measured by aqua-regia digestion in predicting metal uptake in a range of vegetative species sampled from the Sudbury area.

The short-term and long-term benefits of lowering Cd exposure are unknown because of its long half-life in the body. Objectives: We aimed to investigate whether an intervention with low-Cd rice in a contaminated area of China reduced urinary Cd (UCd) levels and improved blood pressure and kidney function outcomes compared to nointervention in consumers of high-Cd rice in the same region. Methods: 106 non-smoking subjects were divided into three treatment groups: the intervention group (replacing homegrown high-Cd rice with market low-Cd rice, n=34), the non-intervention group (continue eating high-Cd rice, n=36) and the control group (continued eating low-Cd rice they have been eating for years, n=36).

E-mail contact: jeryxiong@mail.hzau.edu.cn The iron oxide such as goethtie and humic substances (HS) are the important active components for metal ions binding in the natural soils. In the previous study for the modeling the Pb binding in the goethtie/HS/Pb ternary system, the Linear additivity (LA) model always underestimeted the Pb bound by the solid phase. This caused by the fact that the positively charged goethtie can interact with the negatively charged HS strongly and this interction was not inclued in the LA model. In this study, the effect of soil fulvic (JGFA) and humic acid (JGHA) on Pb binding to goethite was studied with the Ligand Charge Distribution (LCD) model and X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) analysis. In the LCD modeling, the inner-sphere complex between the –FeOH-0.5 of goethite and –COOH of HS and three main types of Pb bound as Pb-goethite (Pb bound to goethite), Pb-HS-goethite (Pb bound to adsorbed HS) and goethite-Pb-HS (Pb bound as bridge between goethite and HS) were considered. The spatial distribution of the small JGFA particles was equal in Stern layer. However part of the large JGHA particles was presented in diffuse layer which was determined by the JGHA diameter and environmental conditions. the results showed that Pb binding to goethite-HS complexes could be described reasonably well with the LCD model and the speciation distribution of Pb was analyzed. At low Pb levels, Pb-bridges were important for both JGFA and JGHA. At high Pb levels and low HS loading, Pb-goethite almost dominates over the entire pH range; but at high HS loading, the primary species was goethite-HS-Pb at acidic pH and goethite-Pb at alkaline pH. Compared with JGFA, there was a constant contribution of Pb-bridge about 10% for the JGHA. For the Linear Combination Fit (LCF) analysis of EXAFS spectra for the ternary systems, the spectra of the binary systems goethite-Pb and HS-Pb were applied as the reference. The fitting results indicated that with the increased HS loading more Pb was bound to the adsorbed HS and less to goethite, which supported the present LCD calculations. The present knowledae contibutes to a deeper insight into the role of FA and HA in affecting the amount and speciation of metal ions in soil systems, which is very useful for improving the accutacy of the risk assessment for heavy metal ion pollution in soils and the evaluation of environmental quality.

Particularly with the increase of environmental pollution, the risks and damages to human health caused by the entry of external pollutants such as heavy metals into the soil attracted great concern of the public. The vast majority of the external pollutants would be adsorbed by soil active components, and exposed on the soil chemical interface. Soil interfacial interactions have profound effects on the sequestration, degradation and biological metabolism of the pollutants. Therefore, focusing on the chemical behaviours of external pollutants in soil and developing soil remediation technologies to meet the social and public needs were of prime importance. To date, our understanding of the impacts of soil mineral–organic matter–microbe interactions on the behaviours of heavy metals in soils, and of an advanced model through soil-plant continuum is still relatively limited. The application of in-situ measurement, micro-examination and element tracing technologies significantly accelerated the development of studies with related to heavy metal interactions with soil active components. The in-situ measurement and the greatly improved understanding of soil microscopic properties based on microscopic spectrum laid solid foundation for the rapid understanding of immobilizing heavy metals in soil and development of soil remediation. Quantum chemistry calculation combined with spectral information has greatly enhanced the understanding of these processes at the molecular level. Meanwhile, the bioavailability and toxicity of heavy metal in soil is mostly decided by its speciation, but not by its total amount. Therefore, it is necessary to make accurate assessments of heavy metal species and speciation distribution. Geochemical models are widely used to predict the speciation and transport of heavy metals that will be important in the control of the solubility, bioavailability and the fate of heavy metals. The various types of models have been developed to calculate chemical speciation or the distribution of chemicals over all relevant forms on different soil active components. In addition, an advanced model through soil-plant continuum is also crucial to screen the trace elements from soil particle, to soil solution and plant rhizosphere. Fundamental understanding of these reactions and processes at the atomic, molecular, and microscopic levels is essential for remediation of heavy metal pollution in soils, sustaining and enhancing soil health, which includes human health, on a global scale. Future research on this extremely important and exciting area of science should be stimulated to soil pollution and remediation as well as sustain the ecosystem integrity.

The objectives of the current study were to (i) evaluate the ability of the OSU-IVG method to predict RBA As for As contaminated soils with a wider range of As content and As contaminant sources, and (ii) evaluate a modified extraction procedure’s ability to improve prediction of RBA As.

Mercury is taken up by all aquatic organisms and may threaten the benefits imparted by fish. Both mercury (Hg) and PUFA occur together in dietary sources for fish, and both are conveyed along aquatic food webs.The eutrophic status of aquaculture units (ponds, reservoirs) in China and elsewhere can also impact fish Hg bioaccumulation and PUFA profiles.And the eutrophication may lower the high-quality PUFA content in fish by changing the plankton community composition. To assess the effect of aquaculture on the fatty acids composition and potentially toxic mercury (Hg)content in fish, we investigated total mercury (THg), methylmercury (MeHg),polyunsaturated fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic (EPA,20:5n−3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n−3) in cultured and wild fish and their potential diets from two reservoirs in southwest China. In cultured fish, mercury contents were lower, but EPA+DHA and omega-3 to omega-6 and (n-3/n-6) PUFA ratios were higher than in wild fish. The lower Hg content in cultured fish was related to the lower Hg in fish feeds and Hg bio-dilution due to the higher somatic growth mainly contributed by the higher DHA contents in fish feeds. As assessed by highly valuable PUFA and potentially toxic Hg contents, these results suggest that these cultured fish had higher nutritional value than wild fish. However, the EPA+DHA content and n-3/n-6 PUFA ratios were lower in plankton from aquaculture reservoirs, implying that aquaculture may change the community structure of the pelagic food, lower the PUFA content in plankton, and consequently reduce dietary PUFA transfer to upper trophic levels.

One of the key factors that regulates the speciation, mobility and lability of trace metal pollutants in natural waters is the concentration and nature of organic matter. Metals may bind to dissolved organic matter (DOM) in complexes of varying stability, or adsorb to particulate organic matter and through sedimentation relocate to the sediment. With the biouptake, metals may be released from their complexes. However, understanding of the interaction, the dynamic processes and the kinetic signature of metals and organics, including dissolved organic carbon and biotic ligands remains incomplete. DGT (Diffusive Gradients in Thin films) is a technique that was developed as a robust in situ speciation technique to measure free metal and inorganic and/or organic complexes which can readily dissociate. These so called labile species include a proportion of metals bound to humic substances. The use of a strong binding resin (Chelex) allows pre-concentration of trace metals, confering sufficient sensitivity to enable measurement of metals by DGT in pristine natural systems. Fluxes measured using dynamic techniques, such DGT and voltammetry (more conventional technique), can be affected by the distribution of species, their transport dynamics (diffusion) and the dissociation rates of the complexes. Unravelling this information is challenging and impossible for voltammetry. Manipulation of the physical properties of DGT has enabled the simultaneous derivation of kinetic and speciation information for natural waters. Deployment of multiple DGT devices with a range of diffusion layer thicknesses can provide directly a visually informative kinetic signature for a range of metals, and with more sophisticated interpretation, information on the dissociation rates of complexes. Previous work has shown that it may be possible to understand the kinetics of metal release from its DOC complexes using in situ DGT deployments, potentially allowing assessment of the types of organic matter present in a system. This work focuses on the investigation of the kinetics of the interaction between metals and dissolved organic matters produced by algae in freshwaters. For most metals the rate at which they were released from the organic matter was fast, but release of Al and Cu were kinetically limited. The relationship between Fe and DOC was a defining feature of the kinetic signatures. The in situ kinetic parameters of metal release from the organic complexes obtained by this novel approach are essential for the future development of dynamic models and for advancing our understanding of trace metal bioavailability and biogeochemical processes in aquatic systems.

We determined water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and oxidation reduction potential. We also determined total arsenic concentration in water samples in the laboratory. Next, we identified Paracyclops chiltoni organisms and determined abundance, body length and sex ratio and compared Paracyclops chiltoni morphology to published literature. The concentration of arsenic in water ranged from 25.5 mg/L to 65.2 mg/L, ​​exceeding both the Mexican guideline for the protection of aquatic life (0.2 mg/L) and the lethal concentration of arsenic (3 mg/L). Water temperature ranged from 18.3 °C to 22.7 °C. Water pH values were between 6.7 and 7.1. Electrical conductivity ranged from 2.7 mS/cm to 6.6 mS/cm, which was slightly higher than typical values for freshwater.

Zooplankton abundance was lowest in rainy season (0.8 ind/L) but highest during dry season (53.6 ind/L). Sex ratios (female:male) were lowest (0.5:1) during rainy season, while they were highest (21:1) during dry season. In copepods, sex ratio is strongly inclined towards females. In regards to the body length, females were between 607 and 747 μm, while males were between 605-733 μm, showing no significant differences to commonly reported sizes for females (556-857 μm) and males (351-751 μm). No differences were found between the morphology of Paracyclops chiltoni living in arsenic contaminated water against the same species described in literature. Further studies are, however, needed to investigate possible genetic adaptations and bioconcentration and speciation of arsenic in the organisms. Paracyclops chiltoni abundance showed an inverse relationship to oxidation reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, and chloride.

Land application of sewage sludge is, therefore, considered as an important pathway for ENP transfer to the environment. The aim of this work was to understand the effects of a sewage sludge containing nano-TiO2 on plants (tomato) when used as an amendment in agricultural soil. Ti was characterized in soil and sludge matrices (concentration, size distribution, shape, speciation, association with other soil particles). We, then, assessed developmental parameters for the entire plant life cycle (4 months) along with metabolic and bio-macromolecule changes and Ti accumulation in plants. Both soil and sludge contained similar amount of Ti (about 800 mg/kg) but with different origins natural vs. anthropogenic. The results obtained on plants suggest that the sewage sludge amendment containing nano-TiO2 increased plant growth (142% leaf biomass, 102 % fruit yield), without causing dramatic changes in biochemical responses, except for a 43% decrease in leaf tannin concentration. Changes in elemental concentrations (mainly Fe, B, P, Na, and Mn) of plant stem, leaves and, to a lesser extent fruits were observed. Fourier-transformed infrared analysis showed maximum changes in plant leaves (decrease in tannins and lignins and increase in carbohydrates) but no change in fruits. No significant Ti enrichment was detected in tomato fruits. Increased plant growth and elemental concentrations are likely due to the nutrients brought by the sewage sludge. The decrease in tannin and lignin can be a consequence of increased plant growth. In conclusion, we evidenced no negative impacts on plants after one plant life cycle exposure. If TiO2 nanoparticles had a negative effect, it was overcome by the positive effect of the nutrients contained in the sewage sludge.

The dataset of SCM parameters characterize the adsorption of selected divalent metals (Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn) at varying metal concentrations and ionic strengths. In general, the CD-MUSIC model provides better fits to the observed metal adsorption data onto the studied Fe oxides than the simpler DLM.

Févriera a LR2T/SRTE, IRSN, France b UMR EMMAH, INRA, France alexandre.flouret@irsn.fr 137Cs is a radionuclide with a half-life of 30 years that is commonly found in soils after nuclear fallout due to nuclear incidents or atmospheric nuclear weapon testing. Due to their properties of accumulation and retention, soils are key compartments for the transfer of contaminants such as 137Cs in the trophic chain. Ingestion of contaminated agricultural products being one of the main component of human exposure, it is essential to be able to predict the fate of 137Cs throughout the soil-plant continuum. The contaminant mobility into the soil, its transfer to the plant and its final distribution between all components are generally described by simple models (equilibrium-based, linear distributions). These models are operational but are not able to account for the variability of soils and plants encountered. Bioavailability is function of both soil physico-chemical characteristics, that impact the environmental availability, and plant physiology which determines the uptake rate and accumulation. The aim of this work is to highlight the preponderant factors controlling the 137Cs bioavailability in the soil-solution-plant continuum by using a model that account for both soil and plant characteristics. The proposed mechanistic model is based on thermodynamic reactions describing the interactions of Cs with the different soil reactive components, coupled with a physiological model of root absorption. Series of experiments were conducted to produce a contrasted data set of 137Cs soil to plant transfer. For those experiments, 2 different plants with contrasted Cs uptake capacities (Millet, Mustard) and 3 different soils with varying texture and mineralogy have been studied. Three weeks exposure studies were conducted with the RHIZOtest® which is a normative device to assess the bioavailability of contaminants in soil. They were completed with batch experiments aiming at characterizing the environmental availability of Cs in soils. A large range of 137Cs soil to plant transfer rates was measured for the different soil/pant combinations. For example a contrasted bioavailability of 137Cs was observed, with the same plant accumulating 10% to 40% of total Cs’s stock depending on the soils. We also observed that during the time of the experiment the plant had absorbed most of the estimated environmental available Cs. Modelling those experiments allowed us to highlight the main soil and plant properties that have a great impact on the contaminant mobility. For example, plant physiological factors were the main driver of bioavailability in condition where environmental availability was not limited (e.g. sandy soils), whereas their roles were reduced in soils with high 137Cs sorption capacity. Such a model may help to reduce uncertainties in the prediction of 137Cs transfer to plants in environmental risk assessment, with a great potential to cover a large range of soils and plants.

Ye, and L. B. Liu School of Environment and Architecture, University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, China mao.lingchen@usst.edu.cn Geochemical lability of trace metals in sediments is crucial for accurate environmental risk assessment. In periodically flooded sediments, the complicated reactions among sediment components induced by changing REDOX conditions and the limitation in analytical methods make it difficult to quantify the metal lability or to identify the dominant factor that controls the lability. We proposed a modified isotopic dilution method, which measures metal lability (known as the ‘E-value’) with minor disturbance of REDOX potential (Eh) during the experimental process. Contaminated sediments with different organic matter contents (OM%) were incubated in laboratory under reducing conditions (by adding N2), and the fluctuation of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn lability (E%=E-value/total concentration) were illustrated in response to the reducing Eh. The ECd% fluctuated the most among all four metals: from +90mV to -45mV, the ECd% decreased by 22%; then elevated by 23% before the Eh reached -135mV; and finally decreased sharply by 21% till Eh=-165 mV. For Cu, Zn and Pb, the similar pattern of E% fluctuation implies that the controlling mechanism are the same for these 3 metals at different stages of decreasing Eh. The combined effect of metal release from mineral oxides, sorption on solid organic matter and complexation with dissolved organic matter leads to an intermittent increase in E% for these 3 metals in the Eh range from 90mV to -135mV. Sharp decrease in E% was observed for all metals in anoxic condition as a consequence of precipitation of stable metal sulphides. Cd lability in sediments with lower OM% is more ‘sensitive’ to the reducing condition than that in higher OM% sediment. With initial ECd%=46% in oxic condition, the value reached up to >94% in the range of 0mV to -50mV. In contrast, the effect from OM% was much less significant for Cu, Zn and Pb when the Eh decreased from 120 mV to -70 mV. According to this study, during the flooding period, the environment may experience highest risk from toxic trace metals in sediments when it reaches suboxic condition. The risk diminishes when it becomes anoxic as the formation of sulphide minerals can largely reduce the lability. Among all 4 metals, Cd should be given more attention especially in sediments with low OM content. The modified isotopic dilution method is suggested for future investigation on the influence from other sediment components, e.g. Fe and Mn oxides, carbonates, etc. on trace metal lability under altered REDOX conditions.

Urinary Cd has been widely used as a biomarker for long-term exposure. However, there is a paucity of direct evidence showing the relationship between food consumption and Cd body burden. Previous dietary Cd assessment has been based on total Cd, which may overestimate the risk since only the fraction of Cd in food that absorbed into the systemic circulation is bioavailable. Besides, nutritional status of Zn, Fe, and Ca have been shown to affect Cd absorption in the gastrointestinal tract, but the effects of mineral nutrients on Cd-RBA in food is unknown. Thus, it is essential to determine Cd relative bioavailability (RBA) in food to refine dietary Cd exposure assessment and determine the effective strategies to reduce dietary Cd exposure. A cohort study of 119 nonsmokers with rice as a staple was conducted at a Cd-contaminated district due to pottery production. Cadmium RBA in foods were determined based on a mouse model. Urinary Cd concentrations measured and predicted from rice-Cd intake with and without incorporating Cd-RBA in rice using a toxicokinetics model were compared. The derived relationships were then utilized to predict urinary Cd for nonsmokers at a national scale of China. To determine the effectiveness of mineral supplements to modulate Cd exposure, an in vivo mouse bioassay was conducted to determine Cd-RBA in rice (0.80 mg Cd kg–1) with and without Zn, Fe, or Ca supplements as nitrate. The geometric mean (GM) of urinary Cd was 1.08 µg g–1 creatinine. Applying Cd-RBA in foods (mean 41.5±12.4, 48.0±9.3, 48.8±21.3% for rice, wheat, and vegetables) via a steady state mouse bioassay, rice was the largest contributor (71.1%) to aggregate Cd intake. For 63 participants with paired urine and rice samples, the GM of predicted urinary Cd (4.14 µg g–1) based on total Cd in rice was 3.5 times that of measured urinary Cd (1.20 µg g–1), while incorporating Cd-RBA to assess Cd intake made it closer between the two (1.07 µg g–1). On a national scale, significantly higher urinary Cd was observed for populations living in southern than northern China probably due to higher rice Cd concentration. Among Ca(NO3)2, Zn(NO3)2, and Fe(NO3)3 supplements, 150–5000 mg kg–1 Ca was the most effective in reducing rice Cd-RBA by 31–80% to 8.5–29%, while 30–200 mg kg–1 Zn was ineffective with Cd-RBA being at 33–57%. Low Fe at –1 had little impact on rice Cd-RBA (39–47%), while high Fe at 80–200 mg kg–1 decreased Cd-RBA by 37% to 26–27%. Incorporating of Cd bioavailability to assess dietary Cd intake is a valuable tool to accurately estimate the potential health effects from rice consumption. Increased dietary levels of Fe and Ca effectively reduced Cd exposure by decreasing Cd-RBA in rice, thereby reducing Cd accumulation in humans via rice intake. Research aiming to reveal the association between Cd exposure and health impact should consider Cd bioavailability in foods. Effective nutrient supplement strategies may be used to alleviate human Cd exposure from rice consumption and the associated health risks.

Maa,b a Research Center for Soil Contamination and Remediation, Southwest Forestry University, China b Soil and Water Science Department, University of Florida, USA liuxue20088002@126.com Elements including cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), and arsenic (As) are widely dispersed in the environment naturally or anthropogenically by agricultural and industrial activities. Once absorbed, they are being persistent in human body with long excretion half lives for decades and thus classified as potentially toxic elements. Food consumption was the main pathway for human exposure to toxic elements compared to inhalation and dermal contact. Thus the accumulation of toxic elements in the environment was of increasing concern due to food safety issues and potential health risks. Wild growing mushrooms have been consumed as a delicacy in Europe and Asia due to their savorous taste, aroma and species heterogeneity as well as therapeutic effect in preventing diseases such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and cancer. Accessible studies concerned elements in mushrooms from nutritional point and observed trace elements Hg, Cd and Pb. In recent decades, statutory limits for metals in wild edible mushrooms have been established, e.g. 0.2 and 0.3 mg kg-1 (FW) for Cd and Pb, 5.0, 2.0 and 10.0 mg kg-1 (DM) for Hg, Cd and Pb. In addition, further elements limits were also established, 3.0, 4.0, 80, 80 and 80 mg kg-1 (DM) for As, Cr, Cu, Fe and Zn, respectively. The health risks of metals depend more on bioavailability instead of total content, however, limited studies elucidated their health risk for humans. In addition, limited information about speciation and distribution of mushroom trace elements was available. Moreover, more attention was put on cultivated mushrooms, less focus on the wild growing ones. Commonly, element contents in mushrooms are species- and/or growing stages-dependent, thus waiting for investigated. Therefore, the aims of the study were to: 1) analysis elements (As, Cd, Hg, Pb and Zn) contents in wild edible mushrooms growing in naturally high background substrates; 2) determine trace elements content in multiple species and changes during growing stages; 3) examine elements speciation and distribution; and 4) propose numeric contributive information on the proportion of element speciation from total content on bioavailability and human health risk. The uppermost layer of 10 cm depth soil will be sampled and analyzed for trace elements. The wild edible mushrooms of different growth stages will analyzed for trace elements total content, speciation, and distribution. The bioconcentration factor (BCF) will be calculated to express the ability of mushrooms to accumulate elements and elements soil-to-mushroom bioavailability. In vitro and in vivo experiments will be involved to examine mushroom elements bioavailability to human and to calculate the numeric contributive of the proportion of element speciation from total content in bioavailability. Basing on this, credible human risk assessment will be proposed.

Inorganic arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen and chronic exposure of this can cause fatal damage to kidney, brain, heart, bladder and lungs of millions of people who rely on rice as a staple food. Therefore, assessing the bioavailability of arsenic from rice is crucial for understanding human exposure and to reduce the risk of arsenic-related diseases. In this study, an in vivo assay using swine was used to measure the bioavailability of arsenic from cooked rice of twelve genotypes grown in arsenic-contaminated field sites in Bangladesh. The average arsenic concentrations in each rice genotypes ranged from 108 ± 4 µg/kg to 580 ± 6 µg/kg. The speciation results indicate that inorganic arsenic contents varied from 73 to 99% depending on the varieties. In swine assay, different swine groups were administered with different arsenic species orally, by intravenous i.e. injection and fed cooked rice and finally blood arsenic levels were analyzed by ICP-MS (Agilent technologies) immediately after collection and arsenic bioavailability from rice was calculated by pharmacokinetic analysis. This study demonstrates that rice genotypic characters influenced arsenic bioavailability in rice grain grown in arsenic-contaminated areas and the bioavailability varied between 25% and 94%. Results indicate that arsenic in salt tolerant rice genotypes Binadhan-10 (25%) as well as brown rice genotypes Kheali Boro (35%) and Local Boro (40%) has lower bioavailability compared to other rice genotypes. Most commonly cultivated and consumed variety (BRRI dhan28) has arsenic bioavailability of 70%, which pose significant risk to consumers. Calculation of maximum tolerable daily intake based on bioavailable portion from rice was higher than those calculated based on inorganic and organic arsenic concentration. Thus, arsenic bioavailability from rice is cultivar dependent and can vary due to chemical form of arsenic. So, both genotypic characters and speciation plays an important role in arsenic bioavailability from rice.

Both P and As are predominantly present as inorganic oxyanions in both terrestrial and aquatic systems, i.e. as phosphate, arsenate and arsenite. The mobility and bioavailability of P and As are greatly influenced by the adsorption of their oxyanions to metal (hydr)oxides. Goethite is one of the most abundant iron (hydr)oxide minerals in natural environment. The adsorption of P and As by iron (hydr)oxides is strongly affected by pH. Apart from pH, natural organic matter (NOM), which frequently co-occurs together with oxyanions, plays an important role in influencing the adsorption of oxyanions. However, the composition and properties of NOM (e.g. particle size) often vary with the sources, which makes the understanding and prediction of oxyanion adsorption challenging. Because NOM contains large amounts of carboxylic and phenolic type of functional groups, which interact strongly with metal (hydr)oxides, we thus hypothesize that the site density of functional groups on NOM is the controlling factors influencing the adsorption of oxyanions at goethite-water interface. In this study, we investigated the adsorption of phosphate, arsenate and arsenite onto goethite in the absence and presence of NOM (four humic acids (HA), three fulvic acids (FA)) derived from different soils as a function of pH (pH 3-11), and surface loading of oxyanions or NOM. In combination with laboratory analysis, model calculation can reveal the whole fingerprint of surface speciation and can make predictions. Thus, the NOM-CD (CD: Charge Distribution) and LCD (Ligand and Charge Distribution) model were applied to describe these interactions and the performance of these two models were compared. Results show that the adsorption of oxyanions to goethite is decreased by the presence of NOM, especially for phosphate and arsenate at low pH.

However, there is a lack of human health risk assessment based on mercury in this region which is crucial to identify hotspots, develop management strategies and to estimate the total population at risk. In this study, we present the human health risk map from the exposure to mercury contamination in drinking groundwater by using the probability kriging geostatistical method for Lucknow monitoring area (1222 Km2) which is situated in the central part of the Ganga Alluvial Plain, Northern India. Our human health risk map contributes to the identification of potential hotspots across all the three distinct sectors (urban, rural and combined farming) of this diverse region. We have compiled mercury data in our previous published study and here, we confirm that the health of the significant population of the region is at risk due to the regular intake of mercury-contaminated drinking water. The dissolved mercury concentrations ranges from 9.74 to 61.42 ppb with an average value of 15.38 ppb. Risk quotients were computed by comparing exposure concentrations with the World Health Organization guideline value (1.0 ppb) to. Additionally, we have also identified the fraction of monitoring area at risk and estimated the health of total inhabitants risk areas through a spatial overlay of the risk map with the area and population data. We have discovered that the probability of exceedance of mercury is the highest in the combined farming sector of the monitoring area due to the presence of various anthropogenic interferences. In the urban sector, the hotspot with high to very high probability for health risk is located in the highest population density regions, where 32% of the total population resides in the 7% of the total land of the monitoring area. In Northern India, these potential hotspots are in the Ganga Alluvial Plain that provides drinking water resources to its habitants who account for ~7% of the world population. Overall, we suggest that the risk from mercury exposure should be considered as a priority by environmental risk managers as it is affecting one of the most densely-populated and agriculturally-productive regions of the South Asia.

To further understand the quality of Se in the Se-enriched rice cultivars, a Se-accumulating rice cultivar (Fengbazhan) cultivated in red soil treated by selenite at levels of 0, 0.5, 1.0, and 5.0 mg Se kg-1 in this study. The Se speciation in grains and the bioaccessible Se species were determined by the high performance liquid chromatography-hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (HPLC-HG-AFS), and the bioaccessibility of grain Se using an in-vitro simulation model was also analyzed. The results showed that Se in rice grains mainly existed in the organic forms, which accounted for more than 60% (61.7-69.6%) of the total Se but no significant differences were detected between the different treatments (P > 0.05). Concentrations of the glutelin-derived Se, as the dominated organic forms, were 116.4 ± 13.5, 243.3 ± 17.7, 579.7 ± 105.3, and 1904.0 ± 51.7 μg kg-1, respectively under the soil Se treatments, accounting for 24.0%, 24.4%, 29.3%, and 30.7%, respectively of the total Se in grains, which was sightly increasing with the soil Se levels. The bioaccessibility of Se in grains were 54.3%, 51.1%, 57.0% and 68.1%, respectively for the Se treatments of 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mg kg-1. The speciation analysis results showed that selenomethionine (SeMet), as the main bioaccessible Se species, accounted for 31.6%, 40.0%, 40.4% and 58.2%, respectively, and the inorganic species, selenite, also accounted for approximately 10% of the total bioaccessible Se in grains. The gastrointestinal simulated results indicated that though the bioaccessible SeMet percentages in grains increased with the Se treatments and more than half of the grain Se could be bioaccessible for human beings, there was still a considerable amount of bioaccessible Se species needed to be identified. In conclusion, the application of selenite in soil can slightly increase the accumulation of glutelin-derived Se in rice grains and the bioaccessible SeMet, which are very important for human health. Additionally, for the Se-enriched rice cultivars, fractions of the organic Se in grain and the bioaccessible Se are still not very high.

However, to date, it remains unclear how HS affect arsenic transformation in flooded paddy soil. In this study, anaerobic microcosms were set up amended with three extracted humic fractions (fulvic acid, FA; humic acid, HA and humin, HM) to investigate the influence of HS on arsenic transformation in flooded paddy soil. Chemical analyses revealed that the rate and extent of As(V) reduction was significantly higher in the HS amended soil microcosms compared to the soil only control, with the enhancement following the order FA > HA > HM. It was verified that microbially-reduced HS could act as an electron shuttle to promote arsenate reduction. The electron shuttling function of HS is strongly associated with its electron transfer capacities. This result highlights the important contribution of microbially reduced HS in arsenic release and reduction in natural paddy soil. Furthermore, RNA-based high-throughput sequencing showed that HS can affect the potentially active microbial community for microbial arsenic reduction. HS increased the relative abundances of Azoarcus, Anaeromyxobacter and Pseudomonas, all of which are potentially involved in the reduction of HS, Fe(III) and arsenate. The arrA gene transcripts clone library showed that FA amendment selected for ArrA related to Geobacter sp. OR-1 while HA and HM selected for ArrA that were related to uncultured organisms. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to quantify the transcription behavior of bacterial 16S rRNA, arrA, arsC and Geobacter sp. in the HS amended and non-amended microcosms.

In addition, contents of Fe were as high as 131 g kg-1 in biocrusts, and 63.3-223 g kg-1 in effluent particles, respectively, in the neutral (6.05-7.74) system.

However, only 5 countries currently regulate the guideline of soil V (42-180 mg/kg) excluding Taiwan. Geochemical fractionation is crucial to the solubility of V in soils, this study attempted to explore the fractions of soil V for the baseline of V from 17 pedons with 94 horizon samples throughout Taiwan. These pedons were selected from different soil parent materials comprising slate, sandstone and shale, andesite, serpentine, and basalt. The fractionation of V in all soil horizons was assessed using BCR sequential extraction technique. The total V concentration was analysed using portable x-ray fluorescence (pXRF) in situ and ICP-AES followed with HF-digestion in the lab. The total V concentration by ICP in the soils from Taiwan ranged from 35.4 to 475 mg/kg and the average level was 182 mg/kg. Moreover, the total V concentration in the basalt-derived soils was much higher than sandstone-derived soils. Nevertheless, the weathering degree of soil did not clearly affect the V level between pedons. Furthermore, V concentration obtained by pXRF was significantly and positively correlated with that by ICP, demonstrating pXRF was feasible alternative to determine V in the field for rapid screening of V. The results of BCR sequential extraction indicated V was primarily fixed in the mineral lattices, while Fe/Mn-oxide-bounded fraction was also observed. Thus, DCB extraction was conducted and demonstrated that V was mainly associated with Fe/Mn oxides.

Mills and Louise Meunier Chemical Engineering Department, Queen’s University, Canada Louise.Meunier@queensu.ca Carcinogenic hexavalent chromium, Cr(VI), may form during metallurgical processing of chromite ores. Chromium naturally occurs in a non-toxic trivalent form, Cr(III), which may convert to Cr(VI) during smelting, and in the presence of strong oxidants in tailings and leachates. Large reserves of chromite ore have recently been identified in the Ring of Fire (Northern Ontario, Canada). As mining exploitation is imminent, the potential for Cr(VI) formation and its release to the environment are of concern, particularly for the local population, including First Nations. Although the toxicity of Cr(VI) is well known, exposure dosage from mine tailings is site-specific, difficult to estimate, and few studies have explored the physico-characteristics of this carcinogen. Chromium-bearing mineral samples from the region, containing between 31 and 35 wt % Cr(III), (provided by the Geological Survey of Canada, GSC). Two size fractions were used: less than 106 microns, and between 45 and 106 microns. Samples were subjected to a modified Physiologically-Based Extraction Test (PBET) to estimate the portion of chromium that may become soluble (i.e. bioaccessible) in simulated digestive fluids. Selected samples were also mixed with amounts of Cr(VI) synthesized in vitro to examine the stability of this hexavalent form and its interaction with chromite ore and tailings. The acidic conditions of the stomach have been previously shown to reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III). Thus, the selected bioaccessibility tests include a saliva phase (prior to the gastric and intestinal phases) to capture a potential worst-case scenario for the release of Cr(VI) in solution. Extracts were analyzed by colorimetry and by inductively-coupled plasma – mass spectroscopy to determine the soluble fraction of Cr(III) and Cr(VI). Preliminary results of PBET bioaccessibility measurements agree with residue extraction tests conducted by GSC and indicate that the CR(VI) extracted from mineral samples is in the range of 32 to 53 mg/kg. The finer particle size fraction tends to release a greater proportion of Cr(VI). Further tests are required to expand on these preliminary findings. Results for this work may be helpful in selecting appropriate chromite ore processing methods that yield tailings which are less likely to oxidize to Cr(VI). Furthermore, this work may inform policy regarding environmental and human health issues surrounding the chromite mining operations in Northern Ontario.

Maa,c a School of the Environment, Nanjing University, China b Future Industries Institute, University of South Australia, Australia c Soil and Water Science Department, University of Florida, United States limengya@smail.nju.edu.cn Arsenic (As) is a group I human carcinogen, causing lung, bladder, and skin cancers even at low As dose. Exposure to As may occur via consumption of As-containing food as exemplified by many market basket surveys. Studies showed that mushrooms accumulate As. Being rich in beneficial antioxidants and minerals, mushrooms are important in Asian and European cuisines. As a consequence, mushrooms are cultivated and consumed worldwide. Yet As concentrations, speciation, and localization in cultivated mushrooms across a large geographic distribution are unknown. To address data gaps identified here, this study assessed the concentrations, speciation, and localization of As in market mushrooms across a large geographic distribution. It was hypothesized that As concentrations, speciation, and distribution would vary with mushroom species and geographic location. To test this, we purchased 141 market mushrooms from 9 species in 9 cities across China. Variation in As concentrations with mushroom species was assessed to identify species with elevated As concentrations. Species with high total As were then subjected to As speciation using high performance liquid chromatography coupled with ICP-MS and As localization using laser ablation coupled with ICP-MS. Finally, the As health risk associated with mushroom consumption was assessed by incorporating As speciation into daily As intake and cancer risk calculations. Total As concentrations ranged 0.01–8.31 mg kg−1 dw, with A. bisporus (0.27–2.79 mg kg−1) containing the highest As followed by P. ostreatus and L. edodes (0.04–8.31 and 0.12–2.58 mg kg−1). However, As in A. bisporus was mostly organic including non-toxic arsenobetaine, while P. ostreatus and L. edodes contained mainly inorganic As (iAs). Based on in situ imaging using LA-ICP-MS, As in L. edodes was localized to the surface coat of the cap, while As in P. ostreatus was localized to the junction of the pileus and stipe. When As speciation and daily mushroom consumption (1.37 g d–1 dw) were considered, daily mushroom consumption may result in elevated iAs exposure, with bladder and lung cancer rates being up to 387 cases per 100,000. Our study showed market mushrooms could be a health risk to the general public and its production should be regulated. This study showed valuable data on As concentrations, speciation, and localization in different mushroom species, which could inspire further studies on the mechanisms controlling different As accumulation, speciation, and localization in different mushroom species. It is also important to identify transporters responsible for the elevated inorganic As accumulation in L. edodes and P. ostreatus. Following this, it is possible to take molecular measures to knock down the key transporters to cultivate low-As mushroom cultivars.

Compared to other cereals, rice can accumulate arsenic to 10-fold higher levels. The two major species of arsenic found in rice plants are arsenite (As (III)), an inorganic form of arsenic, highly toxic to humans and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), an organic form of arsenic, that is relatively non-toxic. The majority of studies have focused primarily on the uptake and unloading of As (III) into the grain, due to increasing health concerns as As(iii) is classified as a class 1 carcinogen. This has resulted in the speciation of arsenic within the plant, and the effects different arsenic species have on the plant being commonly overlooked. Here we aim to improve our understanding of how different arsenic species affect plant growth and the role they play in inducing straighthead disease in rice. Utilizing both hydroponic and field trials, we monitored the uptake and metabolism of arsenic within rice plants. For hydroponic experiments, the rice plants were grown in a nutrient solution and exposed to either DMA or As (III) at varying concentrations. For the field trials, straw was incorporated into the field during planting at 10tone/ha. Our studies showed that elevated DMA concentrations within rice plants can result in reduced plant health and development. This suggests that plants metabolise DMA differentially to As (III). When investigating the relationship between arsenic speciation and total arsenic accumulation within rice grain, we have found that inorganic arsenic concentrations follow a hyperbolic pattern and level out around 0.2 mg/kg. DMA, however, DMA does not follow this pattern. DMA continues to accumulate as total arsenic concentration increases and as a result, has the potential to accumulate at much higher concentrations within the plant. The uptake pathways and metabolism of DMA are mostly unknown. With growing global concern of arsenic contamination in the environment, DMA could pose a real concern for crop health and productivity.

High-fluorine groundwater in coastal plains has been widely documented in China and other countries, including the northern Shandong province of China. The groundwater fluorine levels, its distribution, epidemiology and health-related impacts in the coastal plains of the northern Shandong province were widely investigated, but its enrichment mechanisms and influencing factors are still unknown. Seawater intrusion, a common geological process, greatly changes groundwater geo-chemical properties, especially resulting in high pH, Na+, TDS, Cl- and low Ca2+. Additionally, the groundwater fluorine is elevated under the conditions of high pH, Na+ and low Ca2+. But the process of seawater intrusion has not been noticed when the enrichment mechanism is discussed. The groundwater samples in typical fluorosis area of the northern Shandong province were gained. The high-fluorine groundwater is characterized by seawater intrusion, with high electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), hardness, Cl-, Br-, HCO3-, Li+, Na+. The fluorine levels in groundwater was positive correlated with Ec, TDS, Cl-, Br-, Li+ and significantly with Na+, Na+/Ca2+ and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). The lab simulation experiments of fluorine leaching ability was performed. It is confirmed that fluorine leaching-ability of sediments in the aquifers increases with the higher ratios of seawater or brine water, higher levels of NaCl and NaHCO3, and the lower levels of CaCl2. Therefore, seawater intrusion should be the important dynamic of fluorosis, which is new insight into groundwater fluorine enrichment in coastal plains.

Xiamen island is one of the most rapid developing and urbanizing cities in China. Bottom surface sediments of 18 locations of Yundang Lagoon including inlet channel, outlet channel and upstream lakes were collected to evaluate the contamination, spatial distribution, risk and possible sources of heavy metals including Chromium (Cr), Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni), Copper (Cu), Zinc (Zn), Arsenic (As), Cadmium (Cd) and Lead (Pb). The total concentration of metals in sediments were ranged from 43.78 to 82.38 µg/g for Cr, from 300.32 to 1237.32 µg/g for Mn, from 18.51 to 40.91 µg/g for Ni, from 27.34 to 116.46 µg/g for Cu, from 129.98 to 832.64 µg/g for Zn, from 5.58 to 19.62 µg/g for As, from 0.62 to 3.29 µg/g for Cd and from 40.42 to 83.52 µg/g for Pb respectively. The metals concentration was spatially varied in this Lagoon and maximum concentrations were observed in the upstream lakes (S3) and downstream of the outlet channel (S18). Therefore, minimum metals concentrations were found mostly in the inlet channel (S13, S14) of the Lagoon. In comparison with the marine sediment quality (GB18668-2002, China), it has demonstrated that average concentrations of Cd, Pb, Zn and Cu were higher than class I level of sediment marine quality. And, maximum concentration of Cd, Zn and Cu (Upstream lakes and downstream sampling areas) were higher than class II marine sediment quality level. In addition, maximum concentrations of all metals were higher than the world average shale concentration. The Geo-accumulation indices of Cr, Mn, Ni and As indicate no contamination of these metals, but Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb showed moderate to high contamination levels. Overall, the mixture of metals contamination degree (Cd) indicates all the metals were moderate to considerable degree pollution of this Lagoon. The potential ecological risk (Eri) showed a low potential risk for Cr, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, and Pb in all sampling areas and Cd showed low to considerable ecological risk in the studied areas. Pearson correlation and principal component analysis suggest that Zn, Cu, Cd, Pb TOC were originated from the same anthropogenic sources. Strom water, industrial discharge, domestic sewerage, runoff, combustion of gasoline, boat riding were the important sources to import heavy metals in the Yundang lagoon. Overall, to reduce to pollution level, remediation strategy should be implemented according to the contamination level of different areas.

In this study, the co-transport of Cd2+ and Gt with/without HA in saturated sand columns was investigated by monitoring the breakthrough curves at different pH values. A solute transport model was used to study Cd2+ transport and retention in the saturated sand in the presence of Gt and HA, and a colloid transport model was used to describe the Gt colloid (GtC) transport in the columns. Our results showed that the transport behaviors of Cd2+ and Gt colloids/aggregates were regulated by pH. Cadmium transport was significantly inhibited at high pH due to its adsorption on the sand and Gt. Moreover, Gt retention was gradually stabilized with increasing pH regardless of its forms, i.e., individual colloids (GtC) or larger assemblages of particles due to aggregation (GtA). This retention was obviously enhanced in the presence of HA. Thus, the superposition of increased Cd2+ adsorption on Gt and Gt retention (stabilization) enhanced the immobilization of Cd2+ at high pH. In addition to stabilizing Gt, HA further enhance Cd2+ adsorption on Gt, thus promoting Cd2+ immobilization. However, only a small amount of organicmatter-bound Cd2+ was observed in the columns with injected HA. The major fractions of retained Cd2+ were exchangeable Cd2+ and Fe-oxide-bound Cd2+.

Recent studies have shown that the concentrations of Ga and In in the environment are elevated, which might increase our risk of exposure to Ga and In through crop consumption, and further cause warmful effects to human health. Due to the facts that rice is the staple food for over 90 % of the population in Asia area, and limited information is available on the accumulation of Ga and In in rice grains to date, assessing the potential effect of Ga and In on the plant growth and their accumulation in rice grains is important. Pot experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of Ga and In on the growth and the accumulation of Ga/In in rice plants grown in various soils. Rice plants were grown in three soils (Pc, TWz and Cf series soils) spiked with 30, 50, 100 mg kg-1 of Ga or In, respectively. In acidic soils (Pc and TWz soils), the concentrations of Ga and In in pore water were increased with increased concentration of Ga/In-spiked in soils, and the aluminium (Al) concentration in Pc soils were higher than TWz soils during the growth time, due to the higher amount of available Al in Pc soils. In alkaline soil (Cf soil), the results of pore water indicated the concentrations of Ga, In, and Al were decreased with growth time in all treatments. In addition, it was also found that the concentrations of Ga, In, and Al in pore water of Cf soils were lower than in Pc and TWz soils for the same Ga/In-spiked treatments because of the lower solubility of those elements in alkaline soils. Based on the above results, it is predicted that the plant growth and Ga/In accumulation in rice grains could be affected by the concentrations of Ga, In and Al in pore water of three tested soils.

Arsenic mobility increased in liquid phase due to association with FHC through formation of inner-sphere complexation. Moreover, dissolved organic matter (DOM) or organic colloids regulate the transport and fate of colloid and colloid-associated contaminants. Humic acid (HA), the most representative organic matter in soils, are important in controlling the distance of FHC transport and deposition position in porous media. However, little is known about effects of humic acid colloid (HAC) and FHC interaction on transport and deposition of As in porous media. Co-transport of HAC-FHC and As at different pH was systematically investigated by monitoring breakthrough curves (BTCs) in saturated sand columns. Colloid and solute transport models were used to reveal mechanisms of As transport with HAC-FHC in porous media. Our data indicated that the interaction between HAC and FHC highly influenced the fate of FHC-associated As. Although HAC with high concentrations enhanced FHC transport and further facilitated transport of FHC-associated As, an excess of HAC occupied the adsorption sites of FHC and thus decreased As co-transport with the mixed HAC-FHC colloids. Humic acid colloid-enhanced FHC transport and As adsorption on the mixed colloids were controlled by environmental pH. Although, under the alkaline condition, HAC significantly enhanced FHC and As transport, more As was adsorbed on the mixed colloid and co-transported under slightly alkaline or neutral pH conditions when chain-shaped HAC was present. With decreasing pH, As was gradually co-deposited with FHC since HAC was transformed to sphere-shaped one. The fate of As changed from co-transport with HAC-FHC to co-deposition when environmental pH further decreased.

Arsenic contamination in groundwater is a well-known global environmental problem over the past 10 years. The As in groundwater is released from soils following the development of anaerobic conditions, and arsenite [As(III)] is the predominant As species in the reducing environments. In many parts of the world, arsenic-contaminated groundwater is not just used for irrigation of crops but is also widely used for drinking water, particularly in arid regions where are often concomitant with high alkalinity and/or salinity, causing widespread public health concern. Microalgae are an important primary producer in aquatic systems with great potential in bioremediation of As due to their high As removal ability. Previous studies have demonstrated that Dunaliella salina, an exceptionally halotolerant microalga, is a good candidate in arsenate [As(V)] remediation due to its strong As(V) tolerance and As accumulation ability. However, the detailed As(III) tolerance and metabolism, especially the biooxidation of As(III) by D. salina, remain unexplored. Understanding the inherent mechanisms of As(III) oxidation in D. salina is important for maximizing the As remediation efficiency, since As(V) is much easier to remove from water than As(III) by conventional physicochemical methods such as adsorption, coagulation, coprecipitation, ion exchange, and membrane separation. Therefore, we investigated As(III) oxidation and toxicity in a marine microalga D. salina under different phosphate conditions. The results of 72-h As(III) toxicity experiment showed that D. salina is more sensitive to As(III) than to As(V), indicating that As(III) oxidation by this algae was acting as a detoxification process. The oxidation of As(III) appeared to be more effective with increased extracellular phosphate concentrations. We found that the higher As(V) percentage in the medium under the higher phosphate concentrations was mainly from the biooxidation by D. salina, which mainly occurred on the cell surface whereas intracellular oxidation cannot be neglected. Overall, the findings of this work not only demonstrate that phosphate play a key role in the oxidation of As(III) which occur both inside and outside the D. salina cells but also expand our knowledge of As detoxification mechanism in this marine alga.

Serious environmental arsenic pollution has occurred in countries such as Australia, the United States, Canada, Argentina and Bangladesh.In China, lakes/rivers such as Xiangjiang River, Bijiang River, Yangzong Lake and Datun Lake have been widely concerned about arsenic pollution. Although the arsenic pollution of some lakes has been effectively controlled over the years, studies have shown that the massive accumulation of arsenic in the sediments of lakes/river wetlands remains a significant potential risk that cannot be ignored. In general, under the influence of changes in soil pH and redox conditions, the conversion of As in soil between the easily soluble and insoluble arsenic compounds is a dynamic process. The occurrence of As in the sediment of lakeside wetland directly determines its toxic effects and ecological risks. The current sediment-water interface is the key area for the study of arsenic migration and transformation in the environment. It mainly focuses on the morphology and risk assessment of the in situ sediment As in rivers, lakes and offshore waters, and the effects of different media on the biochemical behavior of arsenic. Migration and transformation of arsenic in soil-rice systems. However, there are few reports on the dynamic changes of As morphology and the corresponding ecological risks in different arsenic-contaminated soils under wetland habitats. Therefore, A pot experiment was conducted to study the variation of the process of arsenic speciation transformation and assess the corresponding environmental risks by risk assessment coding (RAC) in soil with different treatments of exogenous arsenic (0, 50, 100, 200, 400 mg/kg) at different time (50, 100 and 200 d) by typical wetland plant Typha angustifolia L. in simulated wetland habitat. The results showed that the content of non-specific adsorption state As (F1) and the residue state As (F5) were decreasing continuously, and the crystal form of iron-aluminum oxide bound state As (F4) was increasing, from biologically effective to non-biologically effective. As the experimental time lengthens, the environmental risk of As in the soil shows a slight increase after the firstly increased, and showed the middle and low level environmental risk from the middle to the end of the experiment. The research results provide data support for the migration of As in wetlands, and have certain theoretical and practical significance for the ecological restoration of arsenic-contaminated lakes.

The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that soil drying followed by extended flooding enhances solubilisation of metals (Fe, Cu, Co, Zn and Ni). We tested this hypothesis by flooding samples of two contrasting soils: a clay soil and a brown earth, which had each been either dried (40°C for two weeks) or kept at field moisture conditions (36% and 54% of WHC moisture content respectively). The soils were flooded for 31 days with a given amount of water (so that 150 g dry-weight equivalent soil received 400 ml of water). Water sub-samples were collected after day 1, 3, 7, 10, 15, 22 and 31, filtered (0.45µm) and analysed by ICP-MS. The onset of flooding increased dissolved metal concentrations. The release of metals coincided with a reduction in redox potential, suggesting reductive dissolution of metal oxides and desorption of previously sorbed metals. Soil drying resulted in a significant increase in dissolved metal concentrations relative to the moist counterparts following flooding. This could be due to a combination of soil drying (e.g. microbial death, increased crystallinity of metal oxides) and flooding (reductive dissolution of metal oxides) associated factors. The clayey soil released significantly (p Our results suggest that extended periods of drying-flooding have the potential to promote mobilisation of soil metals and thus have implications for catchment water quality.

The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the intensity, duration, and frequency of soil drying-rewetting cycles enhance leaching of TEs (Mn, Zn and Cu). We tested this hypothesis by drying a loamy grassland soil at 4 temperatures (25°C, 30°C, 35°C and 40°C) and two durations (2 or 14 days). Subsequently two replicates of each dried soil treatment plus a moist control treatment were packed in microcosms and rewetted with deionised water. All treatments were subjected to three re-wetting cycles. Second and third rewetting cycles were carried out 7 days after the first and second rewetting events, respectively. Collected leachate was filtered (0.45µm), acidified (Aristar HNO3) and analysed for TEs, using ICP-MS. Relative to the control moist soil (39.7 % moisture content and stored at 3°C), the leachate concentration of all metals increased in all drying treatments. The largest percentage metal concentration increases occurred for the extended drying period (14 days) at 40°C. However, smaller increases in leachate metal concentrations were observed for the shorter drying duration (2 days) at 40°C. The observed increase in metal leaching is perhaps caused by drying-rewetting induced aggregate disruption, enhanced mineralisation, and microbial cell lysis. Our results demonstrate that the intensity and duration of drying enhance concentrations of Mn, Zn and Cu in leachates. However concentrations diminished in the successive rewetting events probably because available metals have been leached and those that remain were not in soluble forms. Our results suggest that increased intensity and duration of soil drying and frequency of successive rewetting have potential to promote leaching of TEs and thus have implications for ecosystem health, especially under changing climate.

These harmful trace metals will discharge into the environment along with the coal combustion and result in environmental degradation. To understand the impact of coal-fired power on the surrounding soil environment, the contents, speciation, pollution levels and ecological risks of some harmful trace metals in agricultural soil around a thermal power plant were investigated in this work. The topsoil samples of agricultural land around Yuxia thermal power plant were collected and the contents of Cd, Co, Cr, Pb, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn in the samples were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry. The speciation of the analysed trace metals in the soil was determined using the modified European Community Bureau of Reference sequential extraction procedure. Geo-accumulation index and potential ecological risk index were used to assess their pollution level and ecological risk. The results indicated that the contents of Cd, Co, Cr, Pb, Cu, Mn, Ni and Zn in the agricultural soil around Yuxia thermal power plant ranged from 3.7 to 6.6, 18.9 to 73.0, 124.4 to 195.6, 40.9 to 162.5, 23.8 to 102.9, 535.5 to 801.8, 33.1 to 48.4, and 24.2 to 189.5 mg/kg, with an average of 5.0, 46.1, 142.2, 77.5, 36.0, 663.3, 39.6 and 84.9 mg/kg, respectively. The mean contents of all analysed harmful trace metal in the agricultural soil were higher than their background values in local soil. The HOAc extractable form, reducible form and oxidizable form of Cd in the soil were approximate, i.e. respectively were 27.1%, 25.6% and 27.1%, which are higher than the residual form (20.2%). Co was dominated by the HOAc extractable form. Cr, Cu, Ni and Zn were mainly associated with the residual form. Mn and Pb were dominated by the reducible form. The mobile fractions (the sum of HOAc extraction form, reducible form and oxidizable form) of the harmful trace metals in agricultural soil were Mn (93.2%) > Cd (79.8%) > Co (70.5%) > Pb (67.4%) > Zn (48.8%) > Cu (47.9%) > Ni (45.2%) > Cr(21.9%). The calculated results of geo-accumulation index showed that Mn, Ni and Zn were unpolluted, Cr and Cu presented unpolluted to moderately polluted, while Co and Pb were moderately polluted, and Cd was extremely polluted. The potential ecological risk assessment results indicated that Cd had very high ecological risk, while other trace metals had low ecological risk. The overall ecological risks of the investigated harmful trace metals measured in the samples were very high level, which mainly contributed by Cd. As a result, the contents of Cd, Co and Pb in local groundwater and crops should be further investigated in the future work.

Rice is a complex matrix made up of components of significant nutritional importance. However, it also contains toxic trace elements. Compared to other cereals and terrestrial-based foods, rice grain accumulates heavy metals such as cadmium (Cd) and arsenic (As) more efficiently. This is because rice plants cultivated in flooded soils takes up heavy metals from irrigated water more easily than other terrestrial crops. Food consumption has been identified as the major pathway for human exposure to potential toxic elements compared to other exposure ways such as inhalation and dermal contact. Once consumed, heavy metals can accumulated in the body and cause severe health effects in several internal organs including liver and lung. In China, rice is one of the main potentially toxic elements sources owing to the great amount of consumption. Consequently, rice is a major source of potentially toxic elements intake for much of the China’s population. As such, it has attracted increasing attention due to exposuring to heavy metals during rice consumption. In this study, paired soil and rice (n=30) samples were collected when rice was ready for harvest during July to November The sampling sites were evenly distributed in soils across a whole province. All rice samples were powdered with a stainless steel grinder and soil samples were powdered with an agate mortar and passed through a 100-mesh sieve. The content of total heavy metals (Cd and As) in rice and soil samples were determined by X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Soil contamination by heavy metals were much more serious in southern China due to mining, smelting and acidic nature of soils. Locally-produced rice is the main staple food for local residents. The aims of the study were to: 1) analysis heavy metals concentrations in rice and soil; 2) assess non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks caused by heavy metals contaminated by rice consumption. The result helps to develop strategies to reduce the transport of heavy metals from soil to rice in the investigated regions.

Effects on the morphology, survival, reproduction, growth, and internal concentrations of As in E. crypticus were investigated using the contact filter paper test and a standard toxicity test in both artificially spiked and naturally-contaminated soil. Oxidative stress was assessed by the antioxidant enzymes and malondialdehyde at concentrations that have non-lethal effects at different time intervals in a bioassay test. Arsenic affected the morphology of E. crypticus more with increasing pollution level and exposure time. Survival and reproduction tests in artificially and naturally contaminated soil showed large differences. Survival showed LC50 values in the artificially and naturally contaminated soil of 78.2 and 565 mg kg-1, respectively. Reproduction showed EC10 values of 6.72 and 84.0 mg kg-1 in the spiked and naturally polluted soil and corresponding EC50 values of 38.2 and 365 mg kg-1, respectively. Body weight and body length of adults and juveniles showed similar trends of decline with increasing As concentration and the juveniles were more sensitive than the adults to As. Comparing the endpoints of the ecotoxicity tests on E. crypticus, reproduction was the most sensitive parameter followed by survival, body weight and body length. Internal As concentrations in E. crypticus are reported for the first time in the present study and increased with increasing As concentration in artificially spiked soil. Significant changes in the antioxidant defenses (CAT, POD and SOD) were induced, indicating oxidative stress at the lower As concentration (15 mg kg-1) over the longer exposure time (8 days) or at the higher concentration (60 mg kg-1) over the shorter exposure time (2 days). An increase in MDA with increasing exposure time and soil As concentration indicates oxidative damage. This study has investigated ecotoxic effects of soil As on E. crypticus in at different contamination levels, verified a series of biological parameters indicating soil As pollution, and provided information on the early diagnosis of soil As pollution using biological indicators.

Ganzha, Gudkov and O. E. Kaglyan Department of Aquatic Radioecology, of of the of Sciences of , Ukraine krisdgan@gmail.com Among the water bodies, exposed to the Chornobyl Nuclear Power Plant accident, the cooling pond (CP) is one of the most contaminated with radionuclides. Currently, over 320 TBq of biologically hazardous, long-lived radionuclides are concentrated in the CP ecosystem. Since the end of 2014, the drawdown of water level in the CP continues, which leads to the drainage of radioactively contaminated bottom sediments. CP is considered as a potential source of additional radiation exposure to the environment. The decrease of the water level in the CP at the present stage has led to an essential change in the hydrological, hydrobiological and hydrochemical regimes, which in the future will inevitably change the physicochemical forms of radionuclides, their mobilization and redistribution between the components of the aquatic ecosystem. The purpose of the research was to establish the features of migration and distribution of physicochemical forms of 90Sr and 137Cs in the components of the CP ecosystem. During 2017-2018 samples of coastal soils, bottom sediments, aquatic plants and bivalve mollusks were taken. The physicochemical forms of 90Sr and 137Cs were determined by sequential extraction. Measurement of the activity of radionuclides in fractions was performed using β-radiometric and γ-spectrometric methods. As a result of the studies performed, it was found that in silty and sandy-silt bottom sediments of the CP deposits at depths of 3–7 m, up to 55% of 90Sr cations were in potentially exchangeable forms capable of passing into solution and absorbed by hydrobionts. The exchange activity of 90Sr in the soils of the coastal strip did not exceed 10% of the total amount. The carbonate form of 90Sr, not involved in active metabolic processes, was 2–8% and 6–32% for silty and sandy-silty bottom sediments, respectively, and up to 46% for soils. The content of 90Sr in organic form in soils and bottom sediments was 34-50%, which indicates the presence of a certain reserve of the radionuclide, which can be absorbed by plants during the root feeding process. The distribution of potentially exchangeable forms of 137Cs in bottom sediments is characterized by insignificant radionuclide content in all studied forms and does not exceed 16%, with the prevalence of the exchange form at depths up to (14%). Thus, about 80% of the radionuclide is inaccessible for metabolic processes in the ecosystem. 90Sr in aquatic plants was predominantly found in potentially exchange forms, namely, 25–30% in the form of adsorbed extracellular cations. 137Cs prevails in fixed forms (up to 50%), which indicates the ability of plants to deposit the radionuclide. In the shells of bivalve mollusks, radionuclides are mainly found in fixed forms (50-80%). In the soft tissues of mollusks, the main share of 90Sr is in the form associated with organic matter (about 50%) and 137Cs is mainly concentrated in fixed forms (more than 60%). The еimplementation of such studies will allow us to evaluate the processes and parameters of physicochemical transformations of radionuclides in the system of \"bottom sediments - water - hydrobionts\", as well as to establish indicators for the remobilization of radionuclides and their subsequent redistribution between the biotic components of the aquatic ecosystem. This, in turn, will allow developing migration models and improving existing methods for forecasting the behavior of radionuclides in water ecosystems in a context of decrease of the water level.

In the present study, the pollution characteristics and health risk of Hg, As, Tl and Sb were assessed based on heavy metal concentrations in soils and crops in the Tl-rich sulphide mineralized Lanmuchang area, using the enrichment factor and potential ecological risk index that were calculated to quantitatively assess the potential hazards of Hg, As, Tl and Sb. The results showed that average concentrations of Hg, Tl and As exceed the threshold value of Chinese Environmental Quality Standard for soils. The potential ecological risk index showed that pollution levels were in the order of Tl＞Hg＞As＞Sb for agricultural soils. The enrichment factor of heavy metals ranked in the order of Hg＞Tl＞As＞Sb in soils close to the Tl-rich sulfide mine. Local mining activities have significant influenced on heavy metal accumulation in soils and crops. Moreover, human health risk assessment indicated that noncarcinogenic values of Hg, As and Sb exceeded the threshold values, and carcinogenic value for As was higher than the safe value (1×10-6). The main exposure pathway of Hg, As and Sb for both children and adults is ingestion of soil particles.

However the long-term stability of immobilized PTTE in soils undergoing phytoremdediation should be predicted for various environmental scenarios (Cornelis et al, 2008). Moreover the PTTE ecodynamicshould be explored under rhizospheric processes rather than bulk soil. Rhizospheric soil corresponds to a geochemical micro-environment influenced by plants (root exudates composed of organic acids and siderophores, respiration) (Cadwell 2005) and microorganism activities (Hiltner 2004). These biological activities locally influence the ecodynamic of PTTE, either directly (precipitation, complexation, adsorption) or indirectly (effects of the rhizosphere on pH and redox potential, dissolution of minerals). Globally biological and soil processes may be strongly impacted by phytomanagement options. Risks of PTTE in terrestrial ecosystems are currently evaluated on the basis of the soil total concentration although it does not well predict toxic effects in soil organisms and plants (Crommentuijn et al., 1997). However an accurate assessment of bioavailability must consider both speciation of PTTE in the rhizopshere as well as the biological receptors they can reach. Speciation in solution is unequivocally considered to be an effective way to estimate the bioavailability and toxicity of PTTE to soil organisms. Conversely, simultaneous investigations of PTTE ecodynamic in rhizospheric soil pore waters (SPW) and ecotoxicological effects have several advantages. The aim of this work was thus to assess the speciation, phytoavailability and potential remobilization of PTTE such as Zn, Pb, Cd, As and Ba in contaminated mine soils with selected laboratory experiments based on concentrations of the different metal(loid)s in both rhizospheric (SPW) and in plant tissues in a context of assisted phytoremediation together with speciation modelling in the SPW. Effects of Salix viminalis (willow) and Lolium perenne (ray grass) together with biochar (BC) amendment on the ecodynamic (characterization, speciation, mobility and phytoavailability) of these PTTE under rhizosphere influence were investigated in a pot experiment over 2 months. Results showed that soluble concentrations of Pb and Zn were decreased through time in contrast to As and Cd while Ba was increased. Experimental data from these time series were modelled with the humic ion-binding model included in the Windermere humic aqueous model (WHAM) to predict their speciation and compared with concentrations and mineralomasses of PTTE in plant organs. BC combined with plants modified the phytoavailability of Pb, Zn, Pb and Ba in SPW while it only slightly influenced As and Cd. BC could indeed act on PTTE accumulation inplant rhizosphere and sorption on soil phases and thus provide a mechanism for PTTE retention in the soil in combination with plant roots.

As China is the largest rice producer and consumer in the world, rice Hg and its associated exposure risk has been of public concerns. Our objectives were to thoroughly investigate total Hg (THg) and MeHg levels in rice sold in Chinese market, and evaluate the exposures and risks of inorganic Hg (IHg) and MeHg via rice intake for Chinese residents. The temporal trend of Hg levels in Chinese producing rice and the Hg exposure were also investigated. Rice samples of 767 brands were collected from Chinese markets according to the producing areas. Results of THg and MeHg in commercial rice were measured. Sensitivity and uncertainty was performed by Monte-Carlo simulation. The exposures and risks of IHg and MeHg for different age-gender groups were calculated under the conditions of without and with consideration of bioaccessibilities of THg and MeHg. The body weights and rice intake rates of different age-gender groups are according to the Chinese National Nutrition and Health Survey. The average rice THg and MeHg levels were 3.97±2.33 µg/kg and 1.37±1.18 µg/kg, respectively. The highest daily intake were obtained in younger groups (2-4 years old for female and 4-7 years old for female), accounting for 6% of the reference dose (RfD)-0.1 µg/kg bw/day for MeHg, 0.3% of the provisional tolerance week intake (PTWI)-0.571 µg/kg bw/day for IHg. When considering the bioaccessibilities of THg and MeHg, the values were much lower than those without considering bioaccessibilities. Relatively lower concentrations than earlier studies were found since 2007. This may suggest a declining temporal trend of THg and MeHg in Chinese producing rice and associated Hg exposures. Generally, Chinese residents met a low and safe MeHg and IHg exposure via rice consumption. Effective Hg pollution control measures taken lead to the decline of THg and MeHg levels in Chinese grown rice.

Pot experiments were carried out using two kinds of soils contaminated with cadmium (Cd), one is alkaline (L-soil, Primosols, pH 8.0) and the other is neutral (T-soil, Anthrosols, pH 6.5). Soils were amended with 0, 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 g kg-1 sulphur (S). The rotation of hyperaccumulator Sedum plumbizincicola in drying and Oryza sativa (rice) in flooding was conducted. The results showed that at the first 30 d of drying growth the oxidation of amended S significantly decreased soil pH and increased soluble SO42-, Cd and Mn in both soils. In rice season soil Eh decreased to below -150 mv and pH increased to neutral at the first few days of flooding. Meanwhile soluble SO42- and Cd at S treatments decreased significantly with the prolongation of flooding time. Compared to the control, S treatments promoted shoot Cd concentrations of S. plumbizincicola at 1.8 to 5.5 times in L-soil and 2.0 to 3.2 times in T-soil, while high dosage of S treatments inhibited plant growth mainly because of Al toxicity under low pH. Rice yields increased and Cd concentration decreased at suitable S dosage. This study concluded that appropriate amendment of sulphur according to soil properties associated with water management can be a feasible method to enhance the Cd remediation efficiency by hyperaccumulator and reduce the Cd accumulation in rice in rotation system of Cd contaminated soils.

The THg concentrations in all rice samples (range: 0.97 to 13.10 μg·kg−1; mean: 3.88 μg·kg−1) were lower than the Chinese national standard (20 μg·kg−1) set by Chinese Ministry of Health. The average MeHg concentration in rice was 1.16 μg·kg−1. There was no significant difference between the THg (T test, P=0.61) and MeHg (T test, P=0.17) concentrations of Japonica rice and Indica rice. Different brands of rice have different concentrations of THg and MeHg. The total HQs (THQs) ranged from 0.0106 to 0.1048, with a mean of 0.0462, which was far lower than 1. This result suggests that there was low Hg exposure through rice consumption for residents in Guiyang.

The solid residue in the extract was separated by centrifugation for 20 min at 1500rpm, and the resultant supernatant liquid was moved to a polyethylene volumetric flask, subsequently, the supernatant was decanted; 8 mL of 0.11 mol/L HAC was added to the residue, centrifuged again, decanted the supernatant, and collected the supernatants; dilute the supernatant to 50 ml with deionized water as the test solution, the solid residue kept for the next step. This method can divided the PHTEs into four different types, and showed the bioavailability. The enrichment factor (EF) and Index of geoaccumulation (Igeo) results showed that Cd was obviously enriched in all lakes and reached the moderate pollution level. A comparison of PHTE concentrations in the lake sediments from 2005 to 2015 found the PHTEs pollution status doubled. Multivariate statistical analysis identified the heavy industries of petroleum and steel in the cities close to lakes and excessive agricultural fertilizing in the region as possible pollution sources of the PHTEs. The Håkanson index method (RI) showed the risk degree of 11 lakes had reached a medium level of potential ecological risk except for one lake which had a low potential ecological risk status.

Recent studies reported much lower methylmercury (MeHg) proportions but higher inorganic Hg (IHg) in farm-raised fish, however, the mechanism of Hg distribution in farm-raised fish body remains not well understood. In this study, we investigated the distributions of primary amino acids, MeHg and IHg in body tissues of two commonly farm-raised fish species (common carp: Cyprinus carpio; grass carp: Ctenopharyngodon idellus) in Guizhou Province, SW China, to understand the effects of amino acids on MeHg and IHg metabolism in farm-raised fish. The two fish species showed low THg concentrations (grass carp: 7.2 to 41.6 ng/g; common carp: 6.6 to 42.7 ng/g, dry weight) and low MeHg proportions (grass carp: 2-45%; common carp: 6- 37%) in their tissues, which are mainly due to the simple food web structures and the fast growth of the farm-raised fish. Positive correlations were observed between MeHg and several primary amino acids (e.g., cysteine, arginine, threonine, phenylalanine, leucine, valine, glutamate, cysteine, serine and tyrosine) in fish tissues, which may be driven by the formation of MeHg-Cys complexes within fish body. However, no clear correlations were observed between IHg and any primary amino acids, indicating the metabolic processes of IHg and MeHg are different. This study advances our understanding that cysteine and its related/derived amino acids may be an important driving force for MeHg distribution and translocation in fish.

We observed elevated concentrations of heavy metals (Mo, Cd) in shales, soils and rice plants collected from Enshi. We demonstrated that the weathering of Se-rich rocks could release substantial amount of heavy metals to the soils in Enshi. Except Cd and Mo, the other heavy metals have low bioavailability. The bioavailiable fractions of Cd and Mo account for 41.84%, 10.75% of total Cd and Mo in soils, respectively. Correspondingly, high mean BAFs of Cd (0.85) and Mo (0.71) were found in rice. Other heavy metals showed low BAFs in rice. The extremely enrichment of Se in soils could inhibit the uptake of Cu and Hg.

Yina, C.H. Zhangb and Y. Gea a College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, China b College of Life Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, China 2018203012@njau.edu.cn Heavy metals emission from mining, industrial activities and municipal sewage discharge in water bodies has become a serious environmental concern around the world, posing severe risks to human health and agroecosystem because of their persistence in the environment. Therefore, it is essential to seek effective methods to remediate heavy metal pollution. Compared to conventional methods such as precipitation, adsorption, ion exchange, membrane filtration, biosorption is regarded as an efficient and cost-effective approach to remove metal ions from the environment. Extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) are high molecular weight products secreted by microorganisms (such as algae, bacteria, etc.) and they are typically composed of polysaccharides, proteins, nucleic acids and humic substances. It exhibits a dynamic double-layered structure consisting of soluble-EPS (s-EPS) and bound-EPS (b-EPS). Previous studies found that EPS could form an important extracellular protective barrier on the algae cell surface, which can prevent toxic metals from invading the intracellular environment. Moreover, metals (e.g., Pb2+, Cd2+) also affect the production and composition of EPS. Additionally, EPS have a variety of functional groups (e.g., -COOH, -NH, -OH, etc.), which have significant effects on the adsorption of metal ions by EPS. However, the binding mechanisms of EPS with heavy metals in microalgae remain unknown. Here, we hypothesize that the EPS yield and components of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii increase significantly under the stress of heavy metals and this in turn contributes to higher metal sorption capacity. We conducted several experiments to verify our hypothesis. The tolerance of microalgae cells and the contents of EPS were evaluated under various metal treatments (Cd, Pb, Cu, Zn). To confirm the combination of EPS with heavy metals, Three-dimension excitation emission matrix fluorescence spectroscopy (3D-EEM) analyses were performed to characterize the components of EPS. Our data show that the total amount of EPS under the stress of Pb and Cu in the 4-d cultivation increased 193%, 46% respectively. When C. reinhardtii was inoculated in the TAP media with Cd2+, Zn2+, the content of proteins in EPS increased. The 3D-EEM analyses demonstrated that tyrosine-like substances and tryptophan were observed at the Ex/Em of 225/324 and 280/337 respectively, and the fluorescence intensity of EPS decreased gradually along with the increase of concentration of four metals. These results indicate that tyrosine-like substances and tryptophan in EPS may play an important role in the adsorption of heavy metals by microalgae. Overall, it can be concluded that the increase of EPS and their components in response of heavy metals may be one effective way to reduce the metals toxicity. Further research is onging to reveal the impact of EPS on the binding capcity of different heavy metals C. reinhardtii.

A great risk is posed to our natural water resources from a widespread leather tanning industry, owing to the heavy use of chromium (Cr) salts during the tanning process. Two major forms of chromium (Cr), trivalent Cr (Cr(III)) and hexavalent Cr (Cr(VI)), are predominantly found in tannery industry wastewater. Chromium(VI) is the most toxic form of Cr which does not have any essential metabolic functions in the living organisms. We aimed to determine the total Cr and its species in wastewater samples collected from several tanneries in district Kasur of Punjab, Pakistan. All the tannery wastewater samples (n = 86) showed elevated total Cr concentration (range: 1-185 mg L−1; mean: 16 mg L−1; SD: ± 34 mg L−1). The concentration of Cr(VI) and Cr(III) ranged from BDL to 17 mg L−1 and BDL to 174 mg L−1, respectively. The Cr(VI) concentration in most of the wastewater samples exceeded the National Environmental Quality Standard (NEQS; 0.25 mg L−1) and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA; 0.1 mg L−1) safe limits in wastewater. The physicochemical parameters of the tannery wastewater (pH, alkalinity, acidity, TDS, Cl, sulfate) were found to be higher than their safe limits for wastewater. Our data indicate that the wastewater of these tanneries is a potential threat to the surface water, soil and groundwater, and hence some suitable remediation strategies are needed to treat Cr-contaminated tannery wastewater, such as employing a constructed wetland technology.

Zhua a Graduate School at Shenzhen, Tsinghua University, China jokloy@126.com Arsenic (As) is a highly toxic environmental pollutant, it is ranking first in the ‘Superfund List of Hazardous Substances’. However, human activities such as mining, the burning of fossil fuels, and pesticide application, have amplified the input of this metalloid in various coastal ecosystems around the world. Coastal environments in close proximity to densely populated, industrialized regions are expected to represent the ultimate sink for TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) and arsenate, which may be critical in driving coexisting pollutants transport and likely influence bioavailability of TiO2 NPs-As. To date, there is only limited information available on the uptake, bioavailability and biotransformation of As(V) associated with TiO2 NPs in organisms. To better assess the ecological impact of As(V) with the presence of TiO2 NPs in coastal environments, the effect of TiO2 NPs on arsenate uptake，bioavailability and biotransformation in mussels Perna viridis were investigated. Compared with previous study about traditional contaminants associated with nanoparticles, the present study provided a new exposure pattern to simulate the pollution status in the actual environment: Test organisms were exposured in different arsenate levels until reaching a steady state, subsequently, TiO2 NPs were added while maintaining the original arsenate level. The results showed that the presence of nTiO2 significantly promoted the accumulation of As in mussels Perna viridis under TiO2 NPs-As exposure. The contents of As speciation demonstrated the As biotransformation in the mussels included As(V) reduction, methylation to monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) and dimethylarsinic acid (DMA), and subsequent conversion to arsenobetaine (AB). The reduced organic species (AB, MMA and DMA) and arsenic methyltransferases (GST) activities of Perna viridis with the existence of TiO2 NPs suggested the detoxification and methylated systems were inhibited. Moreover, organic osmolytes (glycine betaine and dimethylglycine) contents and enzymes activities were reduced after the addition of TiO2 NPs, resulting in a decrease of organic osmolyte - AB proportions. The results showed that TiO2 NPs also induced the disturbance in osmoregulation of Perna viridis. In summary, this study provides a new exposure pattern to elucidated the effects of TiO2 NPs on arsenate uptake, bioavailability and metabolism in mussels Perna viridis.

The total non-cancer risks from total three pollutant sources for both groups exceeded the guideline value of 1 by 7-12 folds and the total cancer risk were also 8-28 times higher than the maximum acceptable level of 1E-04, indicating that high health risk induced by soil heavy metal contamination. Among three sources, parent materials and pesticides, fertilizes application was the largest contributor (52.9%) to total non-cancer risks.

These procedures were used after their validation to obtain the distribution of both the major (Al, Fe, Mn) and trace (As, Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, Zn) risk metals in acid soils. The contamined soil and plant samples were collected from three different acidified sites of . Flame atomic absorption spectrometry (FAAS) was used for determination of Cd, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn. Electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ET AAS) was used for determination of Cd, Ni, Pb at low concentration levels. Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) was used for Al. As was measured by hydride generation atomic absorption spectrometry (HG AAS).

Manganese-oxides govern many geochemical reactions due to their abundance and high reactivity. Despite their importance in cycling redox sensitive compounds in natural systems, much remains unknown about the reactivity of manganese-oxides formed under environmental conditions and how this may be altered by changes in local climates. In order to study how these manganese-oxides react, soils were collected from Graskop, South Africa. Three soil profiles were excavated with a range of manganese concentrations. Each profile was further separated based on horizons, with some of the profiles containing over 20% manganese. Manganese nodules of various sizes are ubiquitous in these soils. The soil in each horizon was thoroughly characterized to determine chemical and physical properties, including cation exchange capacity (CEC), point of zero charge (pzc), Brunauer–Emmett–Teller (BET) surface area, and buffering capacity. X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) was used to characterize the mineralogy of the crystalline material found in the clay fraction. The nodules present in the soils were also analyzed and their crystalline composition was determined with XRD. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken of each soil to characterize the particle distribution and minerology. A series of batch reactions were used to determine the capacity of these soils and nodules to oxidize arsenite into arsenate under a variety of factors that may be impacted by an altered climate. The conditions of the reaction were varied from pH 4.5, 7.2, and 9.0 and temperatures ranged from 4.5 ˚C, 23 ˚C, and 40 ˚C to elucidate how differing pH and temperature influenced the oxidation reaction. Aliquots collected from these experiments were analyzed by liquid chromatography-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LC-ICP-MS). Solid samples from the reactions were taken to National Synchrotron Light Source II and analyzed on beamline 4-BM to determine the changes in manganese oxidation state after reacting with arsenite under varying conditions.

Magnetic chemically reduced graphene (MCRG) and magnetic annealing reduced graphene (MARG) were prepared from the reduction of MGO with hydrazine hydrate and thermal reduction at 500 °C, respectively. The adsorption of Cd(II) and As(V) by MGO, MCRG and MARG were investigated to determine their adsorption properties and molecular mechanisms. The adsorption of Cd(II) and As(V) was pH-dependent and their adsorption capacities followed the order: MGO > MCRG > MARG. Therefore, MGO was selected to systematically study their adsorption behavior in the binary system of Cd(II) and As(V). The maximum adsorption capacities of MGO were 234 mg/g for Cd(II) and 14 mg/g for As(V). The superiority of MGO was mainly attributed to its high dispersibility, thin nanosheets and various O-containing functional groups. The adsorption of Cd(II) and As(V) in the co-adsorption system was increased by 65% and 30%, respectively. This synergistic effect resulted from electrostatic attraction and the formation of type A ternary surface complexes.These new results are valuable for determining the interaction mechanisms, and for designing novel adsorbents, for traditional and emerging pollutants in the environment.

The environmental pollution problems especially for soil ecosystem destruction caused by AMD have been extensively studies in recent years. The previous studies in this field have concentrated on the red soil system, however, have failed to consider the karst soil system. Especially for the study about the AMD contamination of paddy soil system in the vulnerable karst area has not yet been reported. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate environmental impacts of AMD irrigation on karst paddy soil. The findings in this study should have certain theoretical and practical significance in preventing the environmental pollution from mining activities. In this study, we chose the karst regions in Southwest China as the study area, where paddy ecosystem and AMD from coal gangue dumps were selected to be the research object. Through the addition of different levels of AMD to simulate continuous sewage irrigation. The physicochemical and biochemical parameters such as pH, EC, Eh, Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, SO42-, urease, phosphatase, and catalase activity were investigated to assess the effects of long-term irrigation with AMD on paddy soil. The results showed that the paddy soil have a good buffer performance for acidity under the lower pollution level of AMD. However, long-term high-intensity continuous pollution of AMD could lead to significant acidification of overlying water and paddy soil, and significantly increase the salinity of overlying water and paddy soil, and significantly change the redox environment conditions of the original paddy soil system. The continues pollution of AMD could significantly increase the concentration of contaminant such as iron, manganese, sulfate, and heavy metals in the overlying water. These contaminants in the overlying water could be reduced by the adsorption effect and buffer system of paddy soils under lower level of AMD, however, the adsorbed contaminants (Mn, Cu, and Zn) by paddy soil could be released into overlying water under higher level of AMD. The microbial biomass, urease, and phosphatase activity could also be significantly reduced under higher level of AMD. A large amount of H+ and rich iron ions from AMD addition could significantly promote the decomposition of H2O2 causing false positive trend of hydrogen peroxide enzyme activity continue to increase. In conclusion, the physicochemical and microbial characteristics of paddy soil in the karst region will be significantly changed under the long-term irrigation and pollution of AMD and ultimately severely threaten to the environmental quality of paddy soil ecosystem.

MNPs was usually found in contaminated environments, such as contaminated river water and soil. However, the types of MNPs from contaminated agricultural soils in China and their metal speciation were still unknown, which are important information for soil contamination prevention and remediation. We assumed that 1) the types of MNPs were relevant to the geographical location and 2) the metal speciation depended on the MNPs types. 105 samples from contaminated agricultural soils across China were collected, and MNPs were therefore extracted from these samples. The elemental compositions were determined by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICPOES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS). MNPs categorization was achieved by cluster analysis and principal component analysis. Associations of metal contaminants with inorganic minerals and organic matter were further analyzed by Asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AF4) coupled with online UV-vis detector, dynamic light scattering detector, organic carbon-detector, and ICPMS. Morphology and mineralogical characteristics of MNPs were observed by Transmission electron microscope coupled with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (TEM-EDS) and selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Elemental concentrations of MNPs exhibited regional characteristics that 1) Fe and Mn were enriched in MNPs from southeast China; 2) Ca and Mg were enriched in MNPs from southwest China; 3) Cu was enriched in MNPs from copper ore mining areas; and 4) Pb and Cd were enriched in MNPs from lead-zinc ore mining areas. All the MNPs samples were categorized into four types based on their elemental proportions: Type Ca, Type Ca-Si/Al/Fe, Type Si, and Type Si/Al/Fe. Two kinds of MNPs existed in all samples and defined as Ca-organic nanoparticle and Si-Al-Fe-organic nanoparticles according to the AF4-OCD and AF4-ICPMS results. Furthermore, Pb and As were more likely to associate with Si-Al-Fe-organic nanoparticles, while Zn, Cu, and Cd were likely to associate with both organic-Ca nanoparticles and Si-Al-Fe-organic nanoparticles.

Dose-response relationships explain how the response changes as exposure dose changes. However, the results of tests or observations are commonly based on total concentration of heavy metals in environments, not the exposure dose that causes toxicity. The total concentration as a regulatory criterion to assess the toxicity of heavy metals in soils, but ignored the mobile and available distinction among different heavy metal sources. In the present study, the copper (Cu) phytotoxicity to barley root elongation was studied in 17 representative Chinese soils. Also, the EDTA-extractable Cu concentration was applied to evaluate Cu extractability, after which the relationships between EDTA-extractable Cu and total Cu concentration in different soils were established. The concentrations of EDTA-extractable Cu accounted for 89.6–91.2% of total added Cu in 17 Chinese soils. The multiple linear regressions using soil pH, organic carbon content (OC) and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were found to explain over 85% of the variance in Cu phytotoxicity thresholds based on EDTA-extractable concentration. The EDTA-extractable Cu dose-toxicity relationships incorporating soil properties were then derived by regression analysis. Soil properties (soil pH, OC, CEC and oxalate extractable Mn) and EDTA-extractable Cu concentration explained more than 90% of the variance in the toxicity response of barley root elongation. The new dose-toxicity relationships could be used to develop a reasonable remediation strategy for contaminated soils.

In this paper, a robust methodology is presented, taking the variations of aging time and cultivars and soil properties into account to derive soil thresholds for cadmium (Cd) applying species sensitivity distribution (SSD). 39 cultivars of rice were selected to investigate their sensitivity differences for accumulating Cd. Empirical soil–plant transfer model was used to normalize the bioaccumulation data of non-model cultivars. The added hazardous concentration for protecting 95% of the cultivars not exceeding the food quality standard (HC5add) were then calculated from the Burr Type III function fitted SSD curves. The derived soil Cd thresholds based on the added risk approach were presented as continuous or scenario criteria depending on the combination of soil pH and OC. The prediction model for HC5add was applied to the data from the field experimental sites to check its validity and applicability. Most of the soil Cd safety threshold in the 8 field experimental sites lay below the 1:1 line and all of them were within the 2-fold prediction interval.

China 18202757567@163.com The solid-solution partitioning of heavy metals in paddy soil is of great importance to evaluate their availability. It has been well established that phosphate can passivate most of Pb in soil by precipitation. However, it might also facilitate the dissolution of heavy metals in the soil and thus increase their environmental risk, and the initial reason for this is still unclear. To obtain an overall insight in the effect of phosphate in the distribution of Pb in paddy soil, a culture experiment was performed with phosphate added, EDTA as well as Diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) and in-situ solution extraction methods were used to represent different available Pb content. Supplement of KH2PO4 significantly increased the content of Pb and Fe/Al in soil solution while showed no influence on the DGT-extracted Pb, which means the increase of soluble Pb might be due to an increase of complex Pb in soil solution. In addition, the amount of Al in colloids separated from soil solution were also enhanced with KH2PO4 treated, which might elevate the possibility for the combination of colloids and Pb2+. Moreover, a change of surface roughness of soil aggregates in KH2PO4 treated group was observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), and this was conducive for soil solid to retain more Pb with more adsorption sites. Otherwise, Fourier transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) combined X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) analyses claimed that flooding condition promoted the transformation of inorganic-P to organic-P, the latter of which possibly participated in the complexation of Pb in soil. As above, the addition of phosphate (KH2PO4) in soil could enhance the retention of Pb in soil solid by precipitating with Pb and increasing the surface-adsorption capacity of soil aggregates, thus immobilizing most of Pb in soil solid. However, it might also elevate the mobilization of Pb by accelerating the dissolution of metal ions (i.e. Fe, Al) and increasing the amount of colloids, which could combine with Pb and increase its mobility in soil solution.

Previous studies have confirmed that acidophilc bacterias play an important role in the generation of AMD and remediation of AMD, but few researches has been done on the in-situ remediation of AMD in field and little attention has been paid to the variations of microbial community composition in such an AMD treatment system. A pilot system consisting of two oxidation-precipitation cells, two microbial treatment cells and one setting cell, based on microbiological technology, was constructed to treat AMD, and has been effectively running over 5 years up to now. However, we still didn’t know what kind of the microbial community compositions stay in and how they work in the different cells of the pilot system. 48 Sediment samples from different treatment cells in different seasons were collected, and the microbial community compositions in samples were extracted and analysed the Illumina MiSeq platform at Novogene bioinformatics company (Beijing, China). The results showed that the concentrations of Fe, Mn and SO42- were reduced from 920, 46 and 4905 mg/L (inflow) to 71.6, 12 and 3436mg/L (outflow), with the removal rates are 92% for Fe, 73% for Mn, and 29.9% for SO42-, respectively. The increase in pH and decrease of oxidation-reduction potential (Eh) were also observed along the water ﬂow direction in the system. We also found Ferrovum, Metallibacterium, and Leptospirillum were highly enriched in the pilot cells. Meanwhile, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) results indicated pH, TS and Amorphous iron oxide were significantly correlated with the overall microbial communities. And the UPGMA (Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic Mean) tree indicated that distinct microbial communities developed within this pilot system in different time. Based on PCoA (Principal Coordinates Analysis), the microbial composition of each cell was distinct, indicating the physicochemical parameters including pH, TS and Amorphous iron oxide had remarkable effects on shaping the indigenous microbial communities. In conclusion, it was documented that the pilot system is an appropriate system for coal AMD remediation, and the significant differences of microbial community composition were found in different cells of this system and in different seasons.

Organic matter supplied to those soils as decomposing forest litter can cause mobilization of As and other toxic elements, change their speciation in pore water and influence the toxicity to biota. This study examined the chemistry and ecotoxicity of pore water acquired from four soils that developed on the dumps in former As mining sites, in the presence and absence of organic matter introduced with forest litter collected from beech and spruce stands. Soils that contained 1540-19600 mg/kg of As were incubated for 90 days at 70% of water holding capacity. Soil pore water was collected four times (after 2, 7, 21 and 90 days) with MacroRhizon suction samplers and analysed. Chemical analysis involved determination of pH, concentrations of As and metals that had a high enrichment factor (Igeo>3): Cu and Pb, as well as other metals considered most mobile in the environment: Cd, Zn and Mn. Ecotoxicity of pore water was examined in three bioassays: Microtox, MARA and Phytotox with Sinapis alba as test plant. The release of As, unlike heavy metals, was particularly intensive from the soils with neutral and alkaline pH. The results provided by Phytotox had a poor precision, but correlated well with As concentrations in pore water, which indicates that As made a crucial factor of phytotoxic impact on the seedlings. Similarly, the outcomes of Microtox bioassay also indicated a relationship between As concentrations and toxicity, however, other factors contributed to ecotoxicity at very low and very high As concentrations, and the highest toxicity was recorded from the soils treated with forest litter. MARA turned out to be not sensitive enough to give reproducible results at those concentrations of toxic elements that were present in pore water, up to dozens mg/L. The growth of microbes in the MARA bioassay was poorly dependent on the concentrations of As and metals in pore water except for a yeast Pichia anomala the growth of which was related to the concentrations of Cu. The results let us conclude that the bioassays Phytotox and Microtox can provide useful information on ecotoxicity of pore water in soils that develop on As-rich dumps whereas applicability of MARA in those conditions proved limited.

The transport mechanisms of NPs in soil and their adverse effect of NPs microorganisms have been reported in various eco-physico-chemical studies by using different experimental systems, such as columns, microcosms, mesocosms or field lysimeters. Despite the increasing environmental realism in the experimental design, the assessment of toxic effects of NPs in soil still suffers a lack of ecological relevance for soil exposure. It is mainly based on acute exposures although chronic exposures are more likely to occur. This study aims at i) characterizing the mechanisms of NPs transport in columns of 6 highly contrasted naturel soils, ii) assessing the influence of single and multiple applications on the transfer of TiO 2 -NPs through an original exposure approach using soil columns and iii) comparing the effect of single and repeated exposures to TiO 2 -NPs in soil on the abundance and activity of soil nitrifying microbial community. The results permitted to evidence quite contrasted transport levels between the two types of NPs and also between soils. The NPs mobility and impact observed on soil microorganisms were shown to be controled by both the exposure route (concentration, dynamic injection, time between injections) and frequency of applications (single or repated injections). By simulating acute and chronic exposures of soil to NPs dynamically injected, we showed that successive applications of NPs are more damaging for the functionning soil microbiological than an acute exposure. This highlights the importance of considering both doses and exposure conditions for environmental risk assessment of manufactured NPs in soil.

Phyllosphere of duckweeds in paddy soil environments is a hotspot in arsenite (As(III)) oxidation which may have a substantial impact on As biogeochemistry in water environments. Previous work has shown that As(III) oxidizing bacterial communities in the phyllosphere of duckweeds were dominated by Rhodobacter species. In this study, Rhodobacter strain CZR27 that exhibited the ability to oxidize As(III) was isolated from the phyllosphere of duckweeds using an anaerobic phototrophic enrichment culture method. CZR27 is highly resistant to arsenate (As(V)), but more sensitive to As(III). Bioinformatic analysis revealed that CZR27 has three As resistance operons and an As(III) oxidase gene cluster. The As-resistance and As(III) oxidation ability by strain CZR27 and the underlying mechanisms were investigated. Oxidation of As(III) by the strain under anoxic phototrophic conditions coincided with bacterial expression of aioA, indicating participation of the gene in the As(III) oxidation process. Expression of ars genes after exposure to As(III) and As(V) was analyzed. Both As(III) and As(V) were effective inducers. There was no detection of As(III) in cell cultures incubated with As(V), and the genes to reduce As(V) were absent in the CZR27 genome, which indicates that nonenzymatic reduction of As(V) may provide sufficient As(III) for low-level induction of ars genes in strain CZR27. The results indicate that strain CZR27 has As-responsive genes that confer resistance to both As(III) and As(V). Quantitative PCR of aioA revealed the presence of As(III)-oxidizing bacteria in the phyllosphere of duckweeds. The abundance of CZR27 revealed by quantification of the genome-specific gene was significantly larger in the phyllosphere of duckweeds than other niches in the paddy soils. The prevelance of a specific bacterium in the phyllosphere of duckweeds may be useful for efficient and sustainable bioremediation of As-contaminated water.

Bernal Department of Soil and Water Conservation and Organic Waste Management, CEBAS-CSIC, Spain rclemente@cebas.csic.es Phytoremediation of trace elements contaminated soils has faced numerous challenges since this technology appeared as a promising option for the reduction of soil toxicity and its associated environmental risks. The conditioning of the soils to allow plant survival and adequate growth, the selection of the most appropriate plant species for each particular site and final aim (stabilization/extraction) and the management of the biomass generated can be considered the three main issues to be addressed for the implementation of phytoremediation. These concerns become specially challenging when semi-arid conditions apply, as is the case in the Region of Murcia (SE Spain). The creation of a vegetation cover in these soils can be quite a difficult task; common impaired soil properties and low fertility in contaminated areas are often exacerbated in (semi)arid regions, which makes the restoration of these sites particularly complex. Different organic and inorganic waste materials have been used for the amelioration and conditioning of soils in phytoremediation processes. There is a general interest in the use of waste materials (manures, agri-food byproducts, municipal solid waste, etc.) with this aim, as this is a sustainable way for the recycling and re-utilization of these residues. The selection of the most adequate amendments for the improvement of the soil conditions is crucial for the correct development of the plants. However, changes in the properties and chemical composition of the soil normally result in changes in the solubility, mobility, speciation and bioavailability of some trace elements, which may condition the success of the restoration process. Decreased solubility/availability of the metals can be a preferred side effect of the use of soil amendments when the goal is the immobilization of the contaminants in the soil. The opposite effect (i.e. mobilization or increased availability) can lead to limitations in the use of specific materials in the presence of certain elements (e.g., As, Cd, Mn or Zn), or to the need of using combinations of amendments to improve the efficiency of the process. Regarding plants, the use of native or locally adapted species offers the potential to overcome the restrictions provoked by (semi)arid climate for their adequate growth. This, together with their tolerance to the presence of trace elements in the soil, makes this type of plants of special interest for the phytomanagement of trace elements contaminated sites. Obtaining economic and ecological profits from this biomass has received wide attention, and there is a general consensus that this would turn the use of these technologies into reality, now that their options for success and viability have been extensively proved. Transformation of the plant biomass obtained in phytostabilization in a source of renewable energy or in a stabilized material that can be stored, transported and used as soil conditioner are the proposed ways to make these processes cost-effective and of net interest in real remediation approaches. This can be achieved through thermal conversion for energy production, through anaerobic digestion for the production of biogas or through the composting of the biomass.

These areas are generally slowly being abandoned by local farmers, affected by strong rural exodus and landscapes undergo a process of closure. However, ultramafic landscapes have the potential to provide multiple ecosystem services that can contribute to Europe’s goals towards ensuring food security, production of renewable raw materials and renewable energy. Agromining aims at cultivating metal hyperaccumulator plants that are able to accumulate nickel and other strategic elements from metal-enriched soils and transport them to the shoots (> 1%), which can then be harvested as a bio-ore. Such metal-rich biomass can be used to recover highly valuable metals such as nickel, and also to produce energy (heat, electricity) and hence the circular economy. Nickel agromining can thus offer an eco-efficient alternative to classical pyro- or hydrometallurgical processes without disturbing the soil cover and the geology from soils and rocks that would be considered as low-grade ores or sterile material unsuitable for conventional mining methods. Phytomining agro-ecosystems can lead to better soil resource efficiency and can offer a fully integrated, new agromining agriculture that could cover thousands of km2 in Europe, benefit local communities with a sustainable rural development and provide a wide array of ecosystem services which will need to be optimized under a life cycle assessment methodology: (1) Production of bio-sourced metal products; (2) Production of energy biomass; (3) Restoration of soil fertility for conventional agriculture (Ni stress); (4) Limiting Ni intake by local populations and farmers; (5) Use and conservation of local biodiversity (plant and soil fauna and microflora) as cultivated ecosystems; (6) Storage of carbon in cultivated soils and (7) Enhancement of pollination activity at landscape level. In SE Asia, there are also vast areas of ultramafic (lateritic) soils where agromining can be applied. These include both forested and cleared areas uneconomic for traditional mineral exploitation, as in Malaysia, Indonesia and New Caledonia. Work is currently underway in Sabah to restore some value to land abandoned after failed oil palm crops. Agromining can also be integrated into the planning of progressive mineral exploration and post-mining restoration for new mineral concessions. Nickel agromining may therefore be helpful in changing the economical balance in historically-disadvantaged ultramafic regions of the world.

Indeed, after two years of cultivation, CoC had increased O. chalcidica’s biomass by 24% compared to FCon treatment. Moreover, CoC had higher Ni-yields than FCon for the first (7.8 vs 5.8 kg ha-1) and the second year (13.6 vs 9.9 kg ha–1).

Moreover, after two years of cultivation, CoC increased the relative abundance of the phylum Gemmatimonadetes when compared to other treatments, while relative abundances of γ-Proteobacteria were significantly reduced over time for all the treatments. Multivariate regression tree (MRT) provided a tree with three terminal nodes based on exchangeable Ni (Niex) and soil organic carbon (Corg). Niex was the most influencing parameter on the phyla’s relative abundance with all samples collected during the first year characterized by low Niex levels (–1) and separated from those of the second year with higher Niex. Concerning samples from the first year, Corg was identified as the second major environmental factor and separated CoC (Corg > 3.18 g kg–1) from others treatments (Corg –1). Based on the predicted metagenomes, genes belonging to different families were identified depending on the treatments. This study showed that co-cropping a hyperaccumulator with a legume in agronomic systems dedicated to Ni-agromining improved plant biomass production and Ni-yields as in the case of fertilized control, but co-cropping less impacted some microbial soil parameters. Ameliorating agromining by replacing mineral fertilizers would combine eco-efficient or sustainable metal recovery.

The soil was characterized by a pH of 6.1, a DTPA-extractable Ni fraction of 38.4 mg kg-1 and a Sr(NO3)2-extractable Ni fraction of 0.53 mg kg-1. Two Ni-hyperaccumulators were tested: the native hyperaccumulator Noccaea goesingensis and the Albanian species Odontarrhena chalcidica. Three months old seedlings of N. goesingensis were planted in October 2016 and three treatments were established: control (with 20 cm distance between plants), a high density treatment (10 cm distance between plants) and an intercropping treatment with Lotus corniculatus. O. chalcidica was planted in April 2017 after raising the seedlings 4 months in the greenhouse. A planting density of 4 plants m-2 was established for all treatments. The three treatments consisted of a control, intercropping with L. corniculatus and the application of elemental sulphur (0.46 g S kg-1 soil). All treatments were harvested in September 2017. Biomass production (3.65 t ha-1) and Ni accumulation (13.4 g kg-1) was highest for O. chalcidica, resulting in a Ni yield of on average 49.2 kg ha-1 on the control plots. In comparison, N. goesingensis produced a biomass of 2.47 t ha-1 and accumulated 7.62 g kg-1 Ni, which resulted in a Ni yield of on average 23.8 kg ha-1 on the control plots. Intercropping with L. corniculatus affected the biomass production of both species negatively and the shoot biomass was significantly lower on the intercropping plots of N. goesingensis compared to the control. High density planting of N. goesingensis and sulphur application to O. chalcidica plots had no influence on the Ni yield. Hyperaccumulator growth led to a decrease of DTPA-extractable Ni and to an increase of soil pH, with the exception of sulphur-amended plots. On the tested site, Ni phytomining was most successful with O. chalcidica. In future experiments different fertilisation regimes and other promising plant species will be tested in order to optimise plant growth and Ni yield.

The most common and widespread metal contaminant in military lands is lead (Pb). Field experiments were begun at Fort Riley, Kansas U.S.A. in 2015 with a pilot experiment evaluating different propagules in an area with soil total Pb concentration of about 1000 mg/kg and neutral pH. In 2016, another field study was initiated to evaluate soil amendments and planting procedures using a randomized complete block design with four replications. The main objectives of these studies were to determine feasibility of using miscanthus (a second generation biofuel crop) for phytostabilization of this contaminated military site and to evaluate the effect of soil amendments on miscanthus growth, soil-plant Pb transfer, bioaccessibility of soil Pb, and soil health. Based on soil characteristics, five treatments were selected: (i) control plots without tillage and left with natural vegetation, (ii) no tillage, no additional amendments and planted with miscanthus, (iii) tilled soil, no additional amendments and planted with miscanthus, (iv) tilled soil amended with inorganic P (triple superphosphate applied at 5:3 Pb:P molar ratio) and planted with miscanthus, and (v) tilled soil amended with organic P source (class B biosolids applied at 45 Mg/ha, the organic amendment rate used by Kansas Department of Health and Environment for other remediation plots in Kansas) and planted with miscanthus. Soil samples were collected before planting and after each harvest. The above-ground biomass was harvested in early December each year, and dry matter yield was determined. Subsamples of plant material were analyzed for nutrients and Pb. Results from the first year (2016) showed that tilling and soil amendments increased the dry matter yield, and that effects of soil amendments on plant Pb concentration and bioaccessibility of soil Pb were promising. Although there were no differences in the biomass harvested in the second year of growth (2017), both total Pb uptake and Pb concentrations in plant tissues were significantly lower in the miscanthus grown in plots amended with biosolids compared to the miscanthus grown in plots with no added P. Soil extracellular enzyme activities and relative abundances of various nematode family groupings were also measured as soil health parameters, and the results will be discussed. Analysis of samples from the third year of growing season (2018) is underway.

The current study compared the remediation efficiency of several remediation techniques on the same piece of land. The farmland is contaminated by earlier application of sewage irrigation, containing excess amount of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb). Phytoextraction, intercropping of hyperaccumulators and cash crops, chemical immobilization, plow and mix were selected as the four remediation techniques. The total concentrations of metal(loid)s concentrations in soil and crops, and the concentrations of extractable metal(loid)s in soil were monitored during the three-year field experiment. The remediation efficiency was mainly evaluated from the aspects of crops yield and metal(loid)s concentrations of crops. The costs of these techniques were also compared. Plow and mix emerges as the most efficient in situ method to deal with slightly contaminated soil in this piece of land. The results can, on the one hand, provide information for the land owners or utilizers to select appropriate techniques, and on the other hand, give a clue on how to improve the efficiency of current soil remediation techniques.

Therefore, it is exigent for remediation Cd contaminated soil in China. As a landscape, energy plant, and the characteristics of fast growing, productive, easy to manage, as well tolerace to stresses and heavy metals accumulated, willow is a alternative species for[]{#_Hlk535935356 .anchor} phytomanagement. The pollutants tolerace and phytoremediation efficiency of willows varies with genotypes. Thus, three willow genotyes (1011, 172, 2345) were seleceted based on the capacity of Cd accumulation from 160 cultivars to optimize phytoremediation. The three willows genotypes showed considerable Cd tolerance and bioaccumulation in both slight and serious polluted soils. The bioconcentration factors (BCFs) of aerial parts were 6.73, 6.43, 8.81 at slight polluted site and 4.30, 4.48, 7.44 at serious polluted site for 1011, 172, 2345, respectively. However, the biomass of 1011 were about 10.8 t/ha (DW) in the first growing season, significantly higer than 172, 2345. The overall results showed that the phytoremediation efficiency of 1011 was higher than other two genotypes because of the larger biomass. Furthermore, the risk of brownfield sites can be reduced by willows planting as vegetation buffers. The heavy metals (Cd, Pb, Cu, et al) in runoff from polluted site were decreased by more than 80% by willows buffers. Besides the own traits of willows, rhizosphere microbiome and their interactions also determined the efficiency of phytoremediation. Rhizosphere microbiomes composition and interactions were assessed to explore the mechanism of phytoremediation efficiency variation with willow genotypes. The results showed that microbial communities in rhizosphere were highly influenced by willow genotypes. Different taxa of plant growth promoting bacteria were accumulated in willows rhizosphere, and the relative abundance of AMF in rhizosphere of 1011 was richer than other two genotypes at serious polluted sites. Molecular ecological networks analyses indicated more symbiotic relationships among microbes in the rhizosphere of 1011, as evidenced by higher ratio of positive links and negative links between microbes than other two genotypes. Furthermore, two keystone taxa were identified in the rhizosphere of 1011 which involved to nitrogen cycling and nitrogen absorption. This results well supported that microbial community and interactions in rhizosphere associated with larger biomass of 1011 at Cd contaminated soil, which contributed to higher phytoremediation efficiency. The current study provide a cost-effective technology for phytomanagement of heavy metals polluted soils, and enhanced the understanding of influence of microbial communities and interactions on phytoremediation efficiency among willow genotypes.

At present, industrial sludges are to the greatest extent being landfilled, without any economical or environmental benefit. The possibility to recover valuable metals from materials that would otherwise be disposed is of particular interest. Likewise, it is crucial to develop alternative approaches to reduce the environmental pressure of nickel related industry and for the green production of profitable nickel compounds. The existence of nickel hyperaccumulator plant species offers the possibility to investigate new approaches of nickel recovery from industrial waste. Hyperaccumulator plants are capable to accumulate between 0.1 and 3% nickel in their dry biomass and their application for commercial metal recovery from mineral rich substrates has been defined as phytomining. At present, phytomining researches have mainly focused on nickel extraction from naturally nickel rich soils. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the possibility of nickel transfer from industrial waste into plants biomass, to support its recovery from bio-ores. For this purpose, the nickel hyperaccumulator plant Odontharrena chalcidica (form. Alyssum murale) has been cultivated on five substrates derived from nickel-rich galvanic sludge. Different waste materials have been identified from industries operating in nickel plating processes, containing 80 to 150 g kg-1 Ni, and converted into artificial substrates (technosols) to support plant growth. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted for three months on five waste-derived substrates and a natural ultramafic soil control. Fertilized and unfertilized replicates were included to assess differences in plants biomass and nickel accumulation. Pore water samples collection was carried out to monitor microelements and nutrients availability and define possible risk of metal leaching. Results showed that a nickel content between 1 and 2.5% was achieved in the dry biomass of the unfertilized O.chalcidica, while lower concentrations were obtained in the fertilized replicates (up to 2%). Nickel accumulation from three waste-derived substrates resulted to be higher or comparable to the control natural soil. Fertilization resulted to be effective in improving plant biomass for all the matrices, although due to waste toxicity all the replicates growing on waste substrates showed a biomass reduction of 20 to 90% compared with the ultramafic control. The pot experiment results demonstrated the possibility to transfer nickel from waste-derived technosols into plant biomass and thus the feasibility of phytomining application on galvanic sludges. Further studies should focus on improving biomass production with substrate amelioration aimed at reducing waste phytotoxicity.

The spreading and accumulation of REEs in environmental bodies (e.g. water, farmland) is a potential risk for the populations in a long run. The phytostabilization of REE mine tailings could be a way to limit soil erosion and reduce REEs leaching from mine tailings. Ramie (Boehmeria nivea L.), which produces high above-ground and root biomass, and exhibits a strong adaptability to harsh environments, could be considered a good candidate for phytostabilization of mine tailings. The objectives of this work were 1) to investigate the REEs tolerance capacity of ramie through a hydroponic experiment; 2) to investigate the potential of ramie for phytostabilization through a field trial on an abandoned mine site. In hydropony, ramie was exposed to various REEs concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 10, 25, 50 μM). An enhancement of the growth of ramie was observed at low concentration (0.1-5 μM) with an optimum for ramie roots at 0.1 μM and ramie aboveground parts at 1 μM. The plant tolerance index was higher than 1 at low concentration, then significantly lower at higher REEs concentrations (10, 25 and 50 μM). In the field experiment, ramie plants were planted in amended tailings, which modified in the first 10 centimeters with the organic amendments 3.5-4t/667m². After 2 years, plant samples with bulk soils and rhizosphere soils were collected. Compared to bulk soil, the content of nutrients (K, Ca, Na, Mg) and EC, TC, TN increased in the rhizosphere soils, and the soil physicochemical properties were significantly improved. The dry biomass of radish roots accounted for 85-89% of the total dry biomass of ramie. Radish root, which is the main storage organ for ramie, accumulated 13 to 21 mg REEs (i.e. 80% of the total REEs in the plant). In conclusion, ramie can install and grow on REEs mine tailings, and can be used for phytostabilization. In addition, it provides other services such as fiber production for industrial use. Long term effects of ramie on other ecosystem services are under investigation (e.g. biodiversity).

In recent years, plant associated-bacteria and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) were tested for their ability to improve biomass production and Ni accumulation in plants. Another group of plant symbiotic microorganisms are endophytic fungi. Their biggest advantage over AMF is their ability to grow on artificial media, which facilitates the manufacture of pure inoculum under sterile conditions and eliminates the difficulty of their propagation. This fact is particularly important in relation to large-scale production of inoculum. In our studies we investigated the potential role of endophytic fungi in improving Ni accumulation of Noccaea caerulescens. We isolated over 200 stains of fungal endophytes from hyperaccumulators inhabiting ultramafic soils in Europe and tested their ability to stimulate plant growth and Ni accumulation. We also investigated the mechanism of endophyte induced alterations in Ni accumulation. Comparing gene expression profiles (Next Generation Sequencing) of plants that developed the Ni accumulation phenotype with plants that were not affected by inoculation with the fungus allowed us to select genes potentially responsible for the development of the beneficial phenotype. The role of the products of these genes and the mechanism of gene expression activation in symbiotic plants is under investigation.

Particularly rich in metal trace elements, these materials are massively stored in slagheaps and can constitute potential nuisance for the environment and public health. Several studies have shown the effectiveness of phytostabilization processes for rehabilitating sites contaminated by high levels of metals, both because of their sustainable and ecological aspects but also due to their low implementation costs. However, implementing a phytostabilization project for metallurgical slags is a challenging issue. Besides the potential toxicity of metal elements (e.g. Cr, Zn, Cu, V, Ni, Mo, W, Al), slags are almost devoid of organic matter and major nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. They also have a very low water holding capacity (sandy texture), as well as a high pH (>10) that greatly reduces the phytoavailability of essential micronutrients (e.g. Fe, Cu, Zn). The slagheap studied located near Rive-de-Gier (France) contains approximately 500 000 tons of slags spread over an area of about 4 ha. A previous study carried out on the same site has demonstrated that the use of \"Composted Sewage Sludge\" (CSS) as an organic amendment favors the installation of metallophytes herbaceous species naturally able to grow on this type of substrate. Recent studies have also demonstrated the benefits of using AMF (Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi) isolates for the phytostabilization of metal polluted soils and alkaline mine spoils. In this work, we evaluated the combined effects of CSS and AMF inoculation on: i) the soil pore water composition and metals bioavailability and ii) the vegetation in terms of biomass production as well as accumulation of trace metals in leaves. Results showed that AMF inoculation led to root colonization and improved P uptake. We also observed that the CSS amendment has a critical role on plant growth by changing the fluid pH (from 10.5 to 8.5) and thus, the speciation of Al in the system. Indeed, geochemical modelling run with the PhreeqC program revealed that Al becomes soluble, and therefore toxic for plant development, at a pH higher than 9.

Increased Pb availability were observed, and the greatest Pb availability was found in 15-20 cm soil layer. A very low Pb leached from 0-20 cm to 20-40 cm, and no significant changes were observed for soil Pb fractions after NTA addition. NTA addition will not cause secondary pollution of Pb in soils based on a further assessment. Soil respiration and microbial biomass in rhizosphere soils of A. wardii was inhibited after the addition of NTA; however, increased exudation of dissolved organic matter and soil enzyme activities, including urease, acid phosphatase and catalase, were observed in rhizosphere soils of A. wardii. These in turn may help alleviate Pb biotoxicity to rhizosphere environment and plants, and also show great benefit for enhancing Pb accumulation in roots of A. wardii.

The aim of this study was to deepen understanding the mycorrhizal community in 2 PTE-contaminated sites (Pierrelaye and Fresnes-sur-Escaut, France) planted with poplar trees (P. trichocarpa x P. maximowiczii) in order to underline the environmental factors affecting the abundance, diversity and structure of microbial communities. The 2 sites (around 1 ha each) were divided into 4 replicated field blocks with a final plant density of 2200 tree h-1. Half of the trees were inoculated with a commercial inoculum made of a mix of mycorrhizal species. The sites presented different physico-chemical characteristics and various PTE contamination levels (mostly Cd and Zn). Field inoculation had a significant positive effect on biomass production on the 2 sites; although the beneficial effect tended to decrease with time. We characterized the fungal communities using Illumina Miseq sequencing. Although, detailed study of the fungal composition demonstrated a predominance of Ascomycota at both sites, higher percentages were found in Pierrelaye soil. In general, the majority of OTUs for the 2 sites is shared between the two treatments, but Pierrelaye site showed higher homogeneity of OTUs distribution compared to Fresnes-sur-Escaut. Overall, 227 OTUs (≈29%) were shared by all habitats and the highest proportions of unique OTUs is observed in Pierrelaye soil (≈30%).

But some rare plant species can hyperaccumulate Cd in aboveground tissues to 100-fold higher than normal plant species without suffering from toxicity, which are called Cd hyperaccumulators. Sedum plumbizincicola is a Crassulaceae species native to the Cd/Zn mining areas in southeast China. Because of its strong resistance and hyperaccumulation to Cd/Zn, it is a main phytoremediation species of Cd pollution soil restoration test. However, as a consequence of the lack of transgenic methods for this species, the mechanism underlying high resistance to Cd remains unclear. We isolated SpHMA3 (Heavy Metal ATPase 3) from S. plumbizincicola, and first developed a genetic transformation system for S. plumbizincicola and the nonhyperaccumulating ecotype of S. alfredii, so RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing and overexpression of SpHMA3 were performed in the Sedum species. We found that SpHMA3 protein was tonoplast-localized and showed Cd-specific transport activity, and SpHMA3 was highly expressed in the shoots of S. plumbizincicola. The SpHMA3-RNAi lines were hypersensitive to Cd, and the growth of shoots and young leaves was severely inhibited by Cd, but did not affect the accumulation of Cd in the aboveground. Furthermore, a homolog gene of HMA1 (Heavy Metal ATPase 1), SpHMA1, was also isolated and functionally identified from the S. plumbizincicola. The SpHMA1 protein was localized to the chloroplast envelope. SpHMA1 RNA interference (RNAi) transgenic plants and CRISPR/Cas9-induced mutant lines showed significantly increased Cd accumulation in the chloroplasts compared with wild-type plants. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging analysis revealed that the photosystem II of SpHMA1 knockdown and knockout lines suffered from a much higher degree of Cd toxicity than wild type. These results suggest that SpHMA1 functions as a chloroplast Cd exporter and protects photosynthesis by preventing Cd accumulation in the chloroplast in S. plumbizincicola. Taken together, our study showed that SpHMA3 and SpHMA1 are highly expressed in shoots to enable an efficient detoxification of Cd in the leaves. SpHMA1, as a Cd transporter localized at the chloroplast envelope, functions to export Cd from the chloroplasts to the cytoplasm and protect the photochemical reactions in leaf cells of the Cd hyperaccumulator S. plumbizincicola. To keep the cytosolic Cd at low levels, another heavy metal ATPase, SpHMA3, functions to transport Cd from the cytoplasm into the vacuoles. Thus, both SpHMA1 and SpHMA3 are important for Cd hypertolerance in S. plumbizincicola.

To date, various remediation approaches have been employed for the remediation and management of Cr contaminated soils. Phytoextraction is an ecofriendly and emerging remediation approach which has gain attention due to several advantages over conventional remediation approach. The use of energy crops for phytoremediation is an emerging trend worldwide. These energy crops have high tolerance against various environmental stresses, potential to grow in diverse ecosystems and high biomass production make them a suitable candidate for phytoremediation of contaminated soils. The removal efficiency of plants in phytoextraction depends upon several soil and plant factors including solubility, bioavailability and metal speciation in soils. A pot scale experiment was conducted to evaluate the phytoextraction potential of Arundo donax L with the application of acetic acid (A.A) in Cr contaminated soils. Plants were grown in pots filled with 5kg soils for 90 days. After 30 days plants acclimatization in pot conditions, plants were treated with various levels of Cr (2.5 mM, 5 mM, 7.5 mM, 10 mM) and A.A (Cr 2.5 mM + A.A 2.5 mM, Cr 5 mM + A.A 2.5 mM, Cr 7.5 mM + A.A 2.5 mM, Cr 10 mM + A.A 2.5 mM). The application of A.A significantly increased metal uptake and in roots and shoots of A. donax. This increase was observed at Cr7.5 mM + A.A 2.5 mM but at high concentrations visual symptoms of Cr toxicity were observed on leaves. Similarly, A.A applications also affect the activities of key enzymes including catalase (CAT), superoxidase dismutase (SOD), and ascorbate peroxidase (APX) in leaves of A. donax. Based on results it is concluded that the applications of A.A acid for phytoextraction is an alternative approach for the management of Cr affected soils and synthetic chelators should be replaced with organic acids.

Salix caprea is the only woody shrub species present in the vicinity of lead mine and smelter. Despite the severe metal pollution, root tips of S. caprea are colonised by diverse fungal morphotypes, with the black-coloured morphotypes being the most abundant. Element composition and spatial distribution of selected morphotypes were analysed using proton-induced X-ray emission (PIXE).

Among them, 3500 wastelands are polluted. The regional government has supported for twenty years the regeneration of polluted wastelands. The aim is threefold: to decontaminate the wastelands, to economically redevelop areas affected by de-industrialization and to improve the urban environment. In addition, there is growing competition for land use for different types of crops: food, energy and bioactive molecules. This calls for innovation to diversify production methods on marginal soils. The aim of the ECOSOL project is to test the feasibility of producing bioactive molecules useful for the pharmaceutical industry through alternative systems, i.e. plants grown on industrial wasteland during periods of underuse. Five laboratories of the University of Liège with complementary expertise in plant adaptation, geopedology, mass spectrometry, pharmacognosy and agronomy are involved in this project as well as the Public Corporation to support Environmental Quality (SPAQuE) in charge of the remediation of polluted wasteland in Wallonia. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Wallonia are funding the project from 2016 to 2022. A wasteland called “Produits chimiques d’Auvelais» (5.5ha) has been chosen for this case study. At this location, a chemical plant was in operation from 1850 to 1980. The first soil analyses carried out by the SPAQuE in 2010 showed high and heterogeneous pollution in heavy metals and Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons. The project started with an inventory of the specific flora of the polluted wasteland. Then, before the first rehabilitation works were carried out, the physicochemical properties of the soil and the contaminant content were determined. Currently, the physiological and genetic characterization of a brassicaceae species identified on the polluted wasteland and the first field trial of candidate plants are underway.

The adverse industrial activities discharged contaminated wastewater directly into the water bodies that contain toxic substances such as heavy metals and metalloids. Due to the continuous use of these effluents in the agricultural sector may decrease the soil fertility and crop growth. The mobility and availability of these contaminants affect their toxicity and biogeochemistry. The present study was conducted to investigate the toxic effects of marble industrial waste water on Zea mays L under the exogenous application of citric acid (CA) with different combinations such as T1; 25 % marble effluent (M.E) diluted with distilled water, T2; 50% M.E diluted with water, T3; 100% M.E, T4; citric acid (5mM), T5; 25% M.E + C.A, T6; 50% M.E + C.A, T7; 100% M. E+ C.A. The results showed significant decrease in the growth of Zea mays with increasing concentration of marble effluent. The maximum reduction in plant height, root length, number of leaves, leaf area and fresh and dry biomass of leaf, stem and root was observed at the application of 100% M.E as compared to control. Similar to growth conditions the photosynthetic machinery (Chlorophyll a, b, carotenoids), gas exchange attributes (net photosynthetic rate, water use efficiency, stomata conductance, transpiration rate) and the activities of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, APX, CAT) was also decreased with increasing concentration of M.E. The application of CA significantly alleviated the M.E induced toxic effect on Zea mays and ameliorated the growth, biomass, photosynthesis, gas exchange attributes and antioxidant enzymes activities by reducing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and electrolyte leakage. The C.A application also enhanced the metal content and accumulation such as lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), iron (Fe) in different parts of Zea mays. The results concluded that the Zea mays tolerant verities can be the potential candidate for the M.E irrigated soil and might be suitable for the phyto-extraction of Pb, Cd and Fe.

Tusherab aDepartment of Environmental Science and Resource Management, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University, Bangladesh bGraduate School of Environmental Studies, Tohoku University, Japan shamim084du@yahoo.com Cadmium (Cd), a non essential trace element, is found in elevated concentrations in soils due to Cd containing phosphate fertilizer application and industrial waste discharge. In Bangladesh, the daily intake of Cd exceeds the guideline values as the market rice and vegetables were reported containing high concentration of Cd. We aimed to find out the concentration of Cd in soils of Bangladesh and the effect of different rates of compost, phosphate fertilizer and their combinations on the transfer of Cd from soil to kalmi (Ipomoea aquatica) and red amaranthus (Amaranthus cruentus) and the growth of the plants in pot trial. We selected 330 locations from 3 disdtricts of Bangladesh and collected top soil (0-15.0) cm and sub soil (15.0-30.0 cm) samples from each point. The soil Cd concentrations ranged from 0.97 mg/kg to 3.7 mg/kg in top soil (0-15 cm) and 0.96 mg/kg to 3.6 mg/kg in sub soil (15-30 cm). We used soils in the pot trial that had Cd concentration of 1.2 ppm which were collected from an agricultural land. In pot trial, the treatments were control, compost 1 t/ha, compost 5 t/ha, compost 10 t/ha, TSP 40 kg/ha, TSP 60 kg/ha, TSP 80 kg/ha, compost 1t/ha + TSP 40 kg/ha, compost 5t/ha + TSP 40 kg/ha, compost 10t/ha + TSP 40 kg/ha, compost 1t/ha + TSP 60 kg/ha, compost 5t/ha + TSP 60 kg/ha, compost 10t/ha + TSP 60 kg/ha, compost 1t/ha + TSP 80 kg/ha, compost 5t/ha + TSP 80 kg/ha and compost 10t/ha + TSP 80 kg/ha. After bringing the soils from 0-30 cm depth, the soils were mixed throughly, put in to 4 kg plastic pots, treatments (d.w.) were added (w/w), mixed properly and 500 ml water/pot was added daily for 15 days. Then the seeds of kalmi (Ipomoea aquatica) and red amaranthus (Amaranthus cruentus) were sown. After germination the plants were kept in a net house following a randomised block design and allowed to grow for four (4) weeks. There were 3 replications for each treatment. After harvesting the plants, the fresh weight was recorded. Then the plants were dried ( dry weight was recorded), ground and analysed. The highest Cd concentration in kalmi (Ipomoea aquatica) (1.8 mg/kg d.w.) and red amaranthus (Amaranthus cruentus) (2.1 mg/kg d.w.) was observed when the plants were grown in compost 10 t/ha treated soils. Compost 10 t/ha wheather alone or with fertilizer treatments increased the Cd concentration in plants (up to 30%) compared to control while the 1 and 5 ton compost/ha either reduced or not affected the Cd concentration in plants. The 10 t/ha compost application also reduced the pH of soils. Compost 10 t/ha application reduced the growth of plants wheras the other compost treatments alone or with fertilizers either increased the growth of plants or did not change the growth. Lime with compost higher than 10 ton/ha together with reduced phosphate fertilizer rates could be tried to reduce the input of Cd containing TSP in agricultural soils while maintaining the growth of plants.

The inhabitants living in MMAs are exposed to Hg by consumption of Hg-contaminated crops. Therefore, the management for safety crop production at MMAs is necessary to protect the human health. Wanshan mercury mining area (WMMA) located Guizhou province, China, was studied to screen the crops that are low Hg accumulative, based on the distribution of Hg in air, soil and crops. The Hg concentrations in the atmospheres at the study sites greatly exceeded those at background sites. Mercury concentrations in soil range from 0.6 to 943.6 mg kg-1. The total Hg concentrations in the edible parts of 43 types of crops vary greatly from 2.4 to 1274.9 μg kg-1. The edible part of five of the crops (radish, strawberries, corn and potato), which were grown within respective soil Hg concentrations, had Hg concentrations lower than the Chinese National Food Quality Standard. We plant these four category crops into two Hg-contaminated farmlands in the second year, had Hg concentrations lower, too. These crops are deemed low Hg accumulative crops. Based on these results and on the database of land use, a safety agricultural regulation scheme is proposed, which can largely ensure the original agricultural use of farmland and the benefits to farmers by encouraging them to grow these low Hg-accumulative crops. By adapting to this new scheme, the Hg exposure in local inhabitants in MMAs could be significantly reduced.

The present study was undertaken with a view to investigate the functional along with the potentiality of SA and how to nullify the adverse effects of heat stress (42 °C) in tomato seedlings. Our findings revealed that supplementation of 1 mM SA enhanced the gas exchange parameters (Pn, Gs, Ci, Tr, Ls), maximum quantum yield of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), water use efficiency, reduced electrolyte leakage and increased the antioxidant enzymes (SOD, POD, CAT, and APX) activity that helps to reduce oxidative damage through scavenging more reactive oxygen species (ROS) which directly impacts on plants by protecting cell membrane from damage, higher chlorophyll content, lower accumulation of lipid peroxidation, and H2O2. Additionally, exogenous application of SA increased the proline content thus added on osmotic potential which influencing plants for better uptake of water that caused to beneficial effects on stomatal aperture together with photosynthetic apparatus, whereas, high temperature reduced leaf chlorophyll pigment, carotenoid content, leaf water potential, and osmotic potential.

In Galicia, ultramafic outcrops represent 5 % of the land surface and several quarrying activities are developed in these areas, generating large volumes of waste material which is accumulated in spoil heaps and tailings. The implementation of phytomining in quarrying-affected areas could provide an additional metal source to primary ores and, at the same time, reduce hazardous waste volumes and assist in site rehabilitation. Soils derived from the spoils – classified as Spolic Technosols – present physical, chemical and biological deficiencies which limit plant growth and soil functioning. In this context, we aimed to optimise the conditions for plant growth, by targeting several aspects: i) the selection of the most adequate hyperaccumulating plant species, ii) the use of soil amendments to improve physico-chemical and biological soil properties, iii) the design of optimal crop patterns and planting densities, and iv) the use of rhizosphere bacterial strains with plant growth promoting (PGP) traits and/or which influence Ni uptake by plants. In September 2016, a phytomining field trial was established in a serpentine quarry (Bandeira, NW Spain) assessing the performance of four hyperaccumulating plant species (native populations of Noccaea caerulescens and Odontarrhena serpyllifolia and the Mediterranean spp. Bornmuellera emarginata and Odontarrhena muralis) under two regimes of fertilisation (inorganic NPK or composted sewage sludges (CSS)). After a 10-month growth period, the soil physico-chemical and biological properties were improved, especially in compost-amended plots. Nonetheless, further developments of the technique are necessary to fully optimise plant survival, growth, as well as the Ni yields. In May 2018, four new blocks were established, which were amended with different concentrations of CSS (2.5, 5 and 10 %) or distilled grape bagasse (at 2.5 % w/w). Inorganic NPK fertiliser was employed as control treatment.

This land has been either abandoned because of its productivity, or it is used as grassland. Nowadays, these soils are identified as “marginal lands”. Contaminated and degraded soils, such as trace element (TE) contaminated sites, are also included in the classification of marginal lands. Faced with this situation, biofertilization seems to be one of the ways to overcome the problem. It consists in improving the soil properties by inoculation of biological species (earthworms, termites, fungus, and microorganism) in soils, in order to promote the recycling of nutrients, and to quantify the positive and negative externalities induced by this practice on the development of non-food biomass crops. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of exposition of earthworms to a TE contaminated site. In a microcosm experiment, under controlled conditions, two species of earthworms, Eisenia Fetida (as required for the ISO regulation) and Aporrectodea caliginosa (an ubiquitously species), were exposed to a Cd, Zn, Cu contaminated soil (Chanteloup les Vignes, France) during 14 days. For each species, 5 replicates were established and 5 earthworms per cosm were inoculated. Three different treatments were established depending on the water holding capacity (WHC) of the soil: 30, 50 and 70% WHC. Environmental trace element availability was quantified by measuring TE concentration in soil while environmental bioavailability was assessed by measuring TE concentrations in depurated whole earthworm bodies. Finally, toxicological bioavailability was investigated by measuring earthworm survival rate (at 7 and 14 days) and body weight changes (at 14 days). According to the microcosm experiment the results showed that i) although, the studied soil is not favourable for the E. fetida growth (loss of body weight ≈ 3.97%), it seems beneficial for A. caliginosa growth (increase of body weight ≈ 44.11%); ii) soil pH, considered as an indicator of worm activity, decreased significantly in time (from 7.9 at initial time to 7.4 at final time).

The remediation of Ni polluted soil is necessary. Phytoextraction is gaining attention globally due to cost effectiveness, acceptability by the community and high removal efficiency. Numerous organic acids have previously reported to achieve maximum efficiency of phytoextraction. Current study was planned to evaluate the potential of Alternanthera bettzickiana in Ni contaminated soils in alone and with combination of citric acid (C.A). Different physiological, morphological and biochemical characteristics of A. bettzickiana were observed during the pot scale experiment. Plant cuttings of A. bettzickiana were grown in pots filled with 5kg/pot. Nickel Nitrate [Ni(NO3)2] was used as a source of Ni. Different levels of Ni and citric acid were applied (Ni0, Ni5mM, Ni10mM, C.A 2.5mM, Ni5+C.A2.5mM, Ni10+C.A2.5mM) in alone and with combination in soil culture. Results from photosynthetic pigments, antioxidants indicate that the application of C.A reduced metal toxicity and enhanced plant defensive mechanism against Ni stress. Furthermore, Catalase (CAT) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities were increased in plants with increasing metal concentration in the media. Ni content in different plants was in the order of leaves>stem>roots. Thus, we can conclude that A. bettzickiana seems to be valuable for the phytoextraction of Ni contaminated soils.

Soil contamination with trace elements gives great cause for concern due to their toxicity, non-biodegradable nature and potential for bioaccumulation and biomagnification. Similarly, soil contamination with organic compounds, especially persistent organic pollutants (POPs), constitutes an important hazard due to their toxicity, persistence/recalcitrance and high fat solubility. Several strategies can be used to reduce the toxic effects of soil contaminants on humans and ecosystems. Among these strategies, phytostabilization is a phytoremediation option focused on the reduction of trace element bioavailability, while promoting the microbial degradation (bioremediation) of organic contaminants in the rhizosphere. Organic amendments are often included in phytostabilization and bioremediation initiatives to stimulate plant growth and microbial degradation. Likewise, the application of nanoscale Zero-Valent Iron particles (nZVI) is also an interesting option for the treatment of contaminated soil, especially when targeting chlorinated organic contaminants. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of organic amendments (composted horse manure, sewage sludge) for the nZVI-assisted phytostabilization of soil simultaneously contaminated with lindane (100 mg kg-1 DW soil) and Zn (2500 mg kg-1 DW soil) using Brassica napus plants. A factorial design was used to assess the expected beneficial effects of the organic amendments, the application of nZVI and the growth of B. napus on (i) reduction of Zn bioavailability, (ii) degradation of lindane and (iii) recovery of soil health. Among others, the following parameters were measured to quantify the effect of treatments on soil health recovery: bioavailable Zn, total lindane, microbial biomass C, total bacteria and fungi by qPCR, bacterial and fungal structural diversity by amplicon sequencing (16S, 18S), potentially mineralizable N, enzyme activities (dehydrogenase, β-glucosidase, β-glucosaminidase, arylsulphatase, xylosidase, phosphatase, Leu-aminopeptidase), respiration, and water soluble organic carbon. The addition of nZVI reduced the concentration of bioavailable Zn and lindane. Microbial biomass and activity were highly stimulated in treated soils, especially in the presence of amendments. We concluded that the combination of B. napus growth, addition of organic amendments and application of nZVI is highly promising for the remediation of soils simultaneously contaminated with trace elements and organic compounds.

Inoculation with EMFspecies with higher Cu or Cd tolerance generated more phytostabilization and phytoextraction of Cu orCd by host plants. Therefore, we concluded that EMF do not act asa barrier inhibiting the absorption of heavy metals by host plants, but rather promote this absorption. On the other hand, vegetation reconstruction on heavy-metal tailings dumps is a very difficult process. The survivorship of non-mycorrhizal (NM) seedlings after 6 months was only 56%. The survivorships of Laccarialaccata and Hebeloma vinosophyllum seedlings were 89% and 100%, respectively. Inoculation with EMF significantly promoted the absorption of nutrients, such as Pi, by host pine seedlings. Pine seedlings increased the numbers of soil bacterial communities and the activities of soil urease and acid phosphatase. H. vinosophyllum seedlings had the greatest effect among all of these soil indicator parameters. Mycorrhizal pine seedlings significantly reduced the availability of heavy metals in the soil and increased the amount of heavy metals transferred to host plant tissues.

The present study aims to identify new tree species to offer a wider range of trees useful for phytomanagement practices. We implemented three experimental sites in France of 1 ha each (Thann, Carrières-sous-Poissy and Leforest) contaminated by different potentially toxic elements (PTE) with a total of 38 different tree species. The 3 sites were divided into 8 different plots. In order to improve plant remediative capacities, 4 of the 8 plots were inoculated with a commercial mycorrhizal inoculum (Rhizophagus irregulare DAOM 197198 strain). In this study, microbial community structure on rhyzobial soils were analysed using metabarcoding approach (IlluminaMiSeq). Both 16S and ITs primers were used to amplified bacteria and fungi present on each of the three sites and for each of the 38 tree species. Fungal analyse results show that fungi communities are specific of the plant species. For instance, Salix aquatica grandis (a common species for the three sites), previously demonstrated to accumulate high concentration of TE in aboveground biomass, showed no significant difference depending on the site. However, significant dissimilarities were exhibited for Pterocarya stenoptera and Ostrya carpinofolia (the other 2 common species for the three sites), trees with phytostabilisation capacity. Moreover, this study showed that some tree species contribute to change the fungal community in soil if compared to the control soil. On this regard, Carrières control soil were composed by 30% of Mortierellales, 40% of Hypocreales and 30% of 11 other fungi, while, e.g., rhyzobial soil of Salix aquatica grandis presented a very different fungal composition, with a higher proportion of Agaricales (60%). In opposition, bacterial communities exhibited no significant difference depending the tree species neither compared to the control soil. Furthermore, bacterial composition was different from one site to another, demonstrating that soil physic-chemical characteristics play a crucial role in microbial community. Additional details about microbial community structure will be further discussed in the presentation.

Significantly high levels of MDA, a biomarker of Cd induced oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation, was observed in leaves and roots of T. patula plants 8 days after exposure to concentration higher than 10 µM CdCl2. Similarly, significantly high levels of H2O2 was observed in leaves of 35-days-old plants exposed to 25 µM and above concentration of CdCl2 for 14 days, but no such increase in H2O2 was observed in roots of same plants. Moreover, levels of total ascorbate (AsA) significantly decreased and increased in leaves and roots, respectively. In addition, root tissues were also able to maintain high levels of reduced AsA pool as indicated by high AsA/DHA ratio. However, AsA/DHA ratios were similar across leaves of untreated and Cd treated plants. Presence of 1 mM AsA in media during Cd toxicity (25 µM CdCl2) abolished the chlorosis phenotype of plants observed under Cd stress and photosynthetic efficiency (Fv/Fm) was similar to that of control non-stressed plants. The improved oxidative stress tolerance in above ground tissue can be observed by the significant increase in total AsA level in leaves compared to Cd stressed plants. Enhanced oxidative tolerance of plants in presence of 1 mM AsA during Cd stress helped in maintaining significantly higher shoot biomass than Cd stressed plants though significantly lower than that of control untreated non-stressed plants. The increase in shoot biomass translated in higher accumulation of Cd in above ground tissue under Cd stress. The results indicate that the growth of T. patula plants as well as Cd accumulation can be improved under Cd stress by enhancing the ascorbate pool in above ground tissue.

Metal-resistant bacteria were widely used to assist this process by secreting beneficial phytotrophin and immobilizing heavy metal ions. However, while assisting, soil minerals might be able to adsorb metal-resistant bacteria so that induce changes in surface properties of bacteria and influence its metal-immobilization potentials. Furthermore, surface properties of Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria might change differently by the present of various soil minarals, and finally show different metal immobilization preference. In this study, two metal-resistant bacteria (Gram-negative bacteria Enterobacter sp.EG16 and Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus subtilis DBM) were screened from the rhisosphere of Hibiscus cannabinus, and three typical soil minerals (goethite, kaolinite and gibbsite) were chosen. The result showed that the maximum adhesion capacities of goethite, kaolinite, and gibbsite for Gram-negative bacteria EG16 were 534.54, 255.03, and 160.95 mg g−1 and for Gram-positive bacteria DBM were 417.12, 217.58, and 160.27 mg g−1 respectively. The effect of pH on the adsorption of Gram-positive bacteria DBM and Gram-negative bacteria EG16 was similar. The maximum amount of bacteria adsorption occurred at pH 4.0 and decreased with increasing pH from 4.0 to 7.0. The adsorption capacity of goethite was greater than that of kaolinite and gibbsite within the pH range of 4 to 7. The adsorption of EG16 and DBM onto goethite decreases significantly with increasing ionic strength from 1 to 100 mM K+. while ionic strength has little effect on the adsorption capacity of kaolinite and gibbsite. The trend of adsorption capacity of the two bacteria is basically the same with time. Within the first 15 minutes, two bacteria rapidly adsorbed onto the surface of three minerals. Then the adsorption is relatively slow Adsorption saturation between two bacteria and goethite is about 30 min and no significant changes were observed after 30 min. The adsorption of bacteria onto minerals can be characterized by Pseudo-second-order kinetic model. This indicates that the adsorption process of two bacteria on minerals is mainly controlled by chemical adsorption. The image of TEM and FTIR showed the same result. This study help to understand surface changes of bacteria while microbes assisting phytoremediation and give evidence to predict metal-immobilization potentials of metal-resistant bacteria.

Until the smelting activities were ceased in 2004, large amounts of zinc smelting waste slag were randomly stacked along the river and in the surrounding soil without taking any safe disposal measures have caused serious water, air, and soil contamination. Extremely harsh habitat conditions in waste slag such as poor physical structure, nutrient deficiency, and high toxic metals content, resulting devoid of plants in the waste slag site. Severe wind and water erosion in this area are the main ways for the diffusion of heavy metal in bare waste slag sites without vegetation. Phytostabilization, the most promising option for waste slag ponds reclamation, reduces heavy metal bioavailability, improves waste slag fertility, reduces wind and water erosion, and increase the diversity of vegetation and microbial community in waste slag. Particulate organic matter (POM, >53 μm) has attracted widely attention because it is a special type of organic matter that has a fast decomposition rate and is easy to enrich heavy metals. A field investigation showed that considerable organic matter (the thickness of the plant litter reached 3 cm) accumulated on the surface of the Zn smelting waste slag after 5 years of in situ aided phytostabilization. It is hypothesized that the POM formation after the litter decomposition could significantly impact the distribution of heavy metals in waste slag. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the interaction between POM and heavy metals in waste slag under in situ aided phytostabilization. The results showed that the input of litter has decomposed to different particle size fractions of POM, and the percentage of POM with a particle size of 0.05-0.25 mm was highest, followed by >1 mm and 0.5-1 mm, and the 0.25-0.5 mm was lowest. The mass of POM derived from four plants in the following order: Cryptomeria fortunei > Broussonetia papyrifera > Arundo donax > Robinia pseudoacacia. The content, enrichment coefficient, and mass load of heavy metals in the POM increase with the decrease of POM particle size, and the fine particle size fractions of POM with a particle size of 0.05-0.25 mm was the highest. The mass load of Cu, Pb, Zn, and Cd in POM in the following order: Cu>Cd>Zn>Pb. The surface of the coarse particle size POM is smoother, and the fine particle size POM is rougher and has a larger specific surface area. The main functional groups in different particle size fractions of POM were -COOH, -OH, C=O, C=C, and C-OH. The size and composition of POM fractions play a key role in determining the distribution of heavy metals in the waste slag. The finding in this study that the role of POM in heavy metal biogeochemical processes which have important implications for phytostabilization of waste slag.

Hybrid maize cultivars worldwide replaced the traditional cultivars due to their high yield and stress tolerance. The use of amino acid-micronutrients in the form of chelates is recently introduced to cope with heavy metal stress in crop plants. The present work was planned to elaborate the effect of foliar application of Zinc-Lysine chelate on the growth, biochemical attributes, ion balance and rhizospheric properties of hybrid maize under cadmium stress. A pot experiment was conducted in the green house which contains 5 kg of soil and 80 µg/kg CdCl2. Two maize cultivars 3062 and 31P41 were obtained and sown 15 plants per pot. The Zn-lys concentrations (0, 2, 4, 6 & 8 mg/L) was applied foliarly at the 2nd, 5th and 7th week of the cultivation. Foliar application of the Zn-lys showed the remarkably high growth in both maize cultivars as compared with control. Zn-lys fertigation not only reduced Cd uptake by roots but also reduced its translocation in shoots and leaves. It also increased the root and shoot concentrations of ions i.e. Zn, Fe, P, N and K. Zinc-Lysine application also significantly increased the rate of photosynthesis, enzyme activities, plant biomass and nutritional status in both cultivars. The MDA and H2O2 were decreased and activity of SOD, POD, ascorbic acid, carotenoid and total protein was increased.

Qiua,b a School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Sun Yat-sen University, China b Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Environmental Pollution Control and Remediation Technology, Sun Yat-sen University, China chenyingyan817@163.com Phytolacca americana is a high-biomass rare earth element (REE) hyperaccumulator, which accumulates more than 0.2% REEs (dry biomass) in the shoots. Previous studies found that P. americana could grow on ion-adsorption REE mine area of Southern China, and therefore could be a potential candidate for phytoremediation of REE mine wastelands and agromining of REEs. However, the ionic REE tailings are characterized by extremely low content of organic matter and nutrients, which markedly limits the development of P. americana. Therefore the soil properties should be improved (e.g. addition of soil amendments) prior to implementing agromining. On the other hand, the addition of amendments risks to decrease REE availability and uptake by P. americana. So there is a need to investigate the type and dosage of amendments to optimize the plant performance and agromining efficiency. In this study, a pot experiment was carried out with P. americana planted in REE tailings amended with organic fertilizer or biochar at different dosages (1.0% and 5.0%, w/w). For each treatment, a control without plant was also set up. The preliminary results showed that: 1) The biomass of P. americana was significantly increased by the addition of amendments, the dosage of 5% showing the best effect. Compared to the non-amended treatments, the addition of organic fertilizer and biochar increased the total biomass by 7-13 times and 6-9 times. 2) After adding amendments, the pH in the soil showed a significant increase regardless of the presence or absence of plants, which improved the soil acid environment and significantly increased the germination rate of the P. americana. 3) The activity of urease and acid phosphatase significantly enhanced in REE tailings amended with organic fertilizer; however, the addition of 1% biochar had no effect on soil enzyme activity and 5% biochar inhibited them. Compared to the non-planted treatments, the activity of urease and acid phosphatase increased significantly after growing P. americana with different amendments. 4) After amending with 1% biochar, REE concentrations in the whole plants was 812 mg kg-1, which was not significantly different from the non-amended treatments (1089 mg kg-1). For the other treatments, REE concentrations were significantly reduced in P. americana (1% OM, 371 mg kg-1; 5% OM, 31 mg kg-1; 5% BC, 374 mg kg-1). 5) The total amount of REEs extracted by P. americana shoots increased significantly (mg pot-1) when grown in REE tailings amended with 1%, 5% biochar and 1% organic fertilizer compared to non-amended soils. In particular, the yield obtained with 1% biochar is four times higher than that of non-amended treatment.

The experiment was performed on an agricultural field highly contaminated (1526.2 mg/kg Zn, 1158.8 mg/kg Pb and 36.8 mg/kg Cd) by the Non-Ferrous-Metal Works near Plovdiv, Bulgaria. The content of heavy metals in different parts of three varieties of enhanced tobacco (roots, stalks, lower, middle and upper leaves) was determined by ICP. A clearly distinguished species peculiarity existed in the accumulation of heavy metals in the organs of tobacco. Cd levels occur in the order, lower leaves > middle leaves > upper leaves > stalk > root, while Pb and Zn levels occur in the order middle leaves > lower leaves > upper leaves > stalk > root. The content of Cd in upper, middle, and lower leaves reached to 155.6 mg/kg, 120.8 mg/kg, 67.7 mg.kg, respectively. Pb content reached to 1062.5 mg/kg, 927.8 mg/kg, 884.4 mg/kg and Zn to 936.7 mg/kg, 860.1 mg/kg, 459.4 mg/kg. To be able to give an answer for the abilities of the enhanced tobacco to extract heavy metals from the soil and to assess the potential of enhanced tobacco for phytoextraction, the translocation factor (TF=Cshoots/Croots) and bioaccumulation factor (BF=Cshoots/Csoils) were calculated. The translocation factor for all metals is greater than 1(TF Pb -13, TF Zn -9, TF Cd -8). The BF values were lower than TF and reached to 1.2 for Pb, 3.3 for Zn and 4.9 for Cd. Higher root to shoot translocation of these metals indicated that enhanced tobacco have vital characteristics to be used for phytoextraction of these metals.None of these varieties of enhanced tobacco was specified as a hyperaccumulator; nevertheless, all varieties show potential for phytoextraction of Pb, Zn, and Cd. Further studies are required to determine the utilization of residual products of phytoextraction and to enhance the economic value of this crop when growing on industrially polluted soils.

The soil was spiked with Cd at the rates of 0, 5 and 10 mg kg-1 and the experiment was repeated twice. Without inoculation of S. marcescens, Cd stress significantly reduced the plant biomass as well as the quantity of proteins and photosynthetic pigments due to enhanced H2O2, MDA and impaired nutrient homeostasis. Subsequently, S. marcescens CP-13 increased the plant fresh and dry biomass, plant antioxidation capacity, whereas it decreased the lipid peroxidation under Cd stress. In parallel, S. marcescens inoculation conferred the Cd stressed plants to accumulate higher nutrients (K, Ca, P, Mg, Fe and Mn).

Ore residues of the ancient zinc mine “The Avinières” (St-Laurent-le-minier, France), stored in tailing ponds, were collected and homogenised before filling the columns and lysimeters. These setups were unplanted (controls) or vegetated with three plant species: Anthyllis Vulneraria (metallicolous plant), Festuca arvernensis and Koeleria vallesiana, alone or mixed A. Vulneraria was mycorhized with Mesorhizobium metallidurans in order to improve its growth through nitrogen fixation. Rain simulations were performed every month or 6 months on the columns and lysimeters, respectively. Water balance was controlled to be equivalent in both situations. Physical and geochemical factors were monitored all along the period and especially during the leaching experiments (water flux, pH, heavy metal content, ionic mass balance…). These factors were shown to be quite constant during each leaching experiment but evolved significantly with time and also between the different vegetation conditions. Plant growth was shown to modify water infiltration and metal concentrations in the leachates. The temporal increase of water flux observed in the columns and lysimeters along the infiltration experiments was attributed to the rhizophere development. In columns and lysimeters vegetated with A. vulneraria only, high nitrate contents were measured in the leachates, in relation with nitrogen fixation. On the contrary when A. vulneraria was associated with F. arvernensis alone or with K. vallesiana, nitrate was directly consumed by the latter two plants and further undetected in the leachates, demonstrating the advantage of plant associations for phytoremediation actions. Furthermore compared to unplanted columns or lysimeters, the leaching of cadmium and zinc in vegetated ore residues was significantly and variably decreased depending on the number of plant species. On the contrary, lead mobilization from the ore residues was very low in relation with its low water solubility, and seemed unaffected by plants introduction. Our results showed that plant species introduction modifies both the physical properties of the ore residue and also its geochemistry, with strong benefits in terms of plant growth and heavy metal retention. Modelling of these results with a combined hydro-geochemical approach is ongoing and will help better understanding the processes involved in metal transfer limitation. These results thus demonstrate the benefit of mixing grass and metallicolous plants to stabilize ore residues from mining activities.

However, most plants used for Cd phytoremediation are glycophytes and hence not suitable to remediate contaminated saline soils. Australian native halophyte Carpobrotus rossii produces high biomass, and has been shown to tolerate a mixture of heavy metals and to accumulate Cd. However, limited information is available on the effect of salinity on Cd phytoextraction and associated mechanism in this species. This study examined the effect of salinity on Cd accumulation, translocation, and speciation in C. rossii. Plants were grown in nutrient solution with different types and levels of salts in the presence of Cd. Plant growth and Cd uptake were measured, and Cd speciation analyzed using synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy. In the first experiment, increasing NaCl concentration from 0 to 100 mM in nutrient solution without Cd did not significantly affect plant growth. At 15 μM Cd, NaCl addition increased plant relative growth rate by up to 82%, which had resulted from decreases in Cd root uptake and root-to-shoot translocation and hence shoot Cd accumulation. Increasing NaCl addition decreased the concentration of phytochelatins, while the concentration of phytochelatins correlated positively with Cd concentrations in plants. The responses of organic acids and amino acids in plants to the addition of Cd and NaCl were inconsistent. The second experiment confirmed that salt addition decreased shoot Cd accumulation due to decreased root-to-shoot translocation, irrespective of salt type (25 mM NaNO3, 12.5 mM Na2SO4 or 25 mM NaCl). The decrease in Cd translocation was not due to changes in Cd speciation within the plant tissues after 10- to 20-d treatment. After 10-d treatment, 61-94% Cd was bound to S-containing ligands (Cd-S) in plant, while the Cd in the xylem sap existed as free Cd2+ or complexes with carboxyl groups (Cd-OH). However, when exposed to Cd for ≤ 24 h, 70% of the Cd in the roots was present as Cd-OH. Furthermore, salt addition increased the proportion of Cd-S but decreased that of Cd-OH in the roots within 24 h, which was not due to changes in glutathione and phytochelatin concentrations in plant tissues. In conclusions, salinity could decrease shoot Cd accumulation by decreasing Cd root-to-shoot translocation even under constant Cd2+ activities in the growing media. The decreased Cd translocation had partly resulted from the rapid formation of less-mobile Cd-S complexes within the root. Peptides and organic acids, particularly phytochelatins, played an important role in plant Cd tolerance and accumulation although the changes of those metabolites were not the main reason for the decreased Cd accumulation in C. rossii.

As an example in 2017, 25%, 54% and 71% of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium applied on cultivated soils have been applied as organic fertilizers issued from organic wastes, respectively in France. Additionally, the associated input of organic matter could also contribute at increasing soil organic carbon stocks, thus improving soil fertility and potential climate change mitigation. The main sources of organic wastes are of agricultural origin with all animal manures, but also of industrial origin (agro-industries or other) or urban origins (food wastes, green wastes, sewage sludges…). If agricultural and industrial wastes are largely recycled in agriculture, the recycling of urban wastes is strongly encouraged after biological treatments (composting or anaerobic digestion). Finally, urban sewage sludges are also recycled in agriculture in many countries. If these recycling participate to circular economy, such practice needs to be proved to have no adverse impacts on soil, crop and water qualities. The objective is to focus on trace element (TE) contents in these organic fertilizers and the consequences of their repeated application on TE contents in soils, their potential transfers to crops and soil solutions then to food chain and ground waters. A network of long-term field experiments (SOERE-PRO) have been created among French research institutes, to quantify, explain and be able to predict the consequences of repeated fertilization with OW on soil and water qualities and on crop production and quality. The SOERE-PRO included different pedoclimatic conditions including temperate and tropical conditions, various OW including animal manures and slurries, sewage sludge composted or not, biowaste composts and digestates… with some experiments as old as 1998. TE bioavailability for crops and mobility in soils depend on their speciation in OW and soils but also on soil characteristics such as pH and soil organic matter content or dissolved organic matter content in soil solution. The SOERE-PRO will be presented, and also examples of results of TE mass balance, interactions between impacts (pH and TE mobility for example), soil biological activities, evolution of TE contents in soil, crop and water since 20 years. Finally, questions will be asked from the end-user and agronomist point of vue on the development of pertinent risk indicators.

Céline Laurenta,b, M.N. Bravina, O.Crouzetb, C.Pelosib and I.Lamyb a CIRAD, UPR Recyclage et Risque, France b INRA-AgroParisTech, UMR Ecosys, France celine.laurent@cirad.fr Amendments with organic residues (OR) are a major source of copper (Cu) contamination in agricultural soils. The chronic soil contamination with Cu raises the problem of potential toxic effects of Cu on soil organisms and then the long-term sustainability of OR recycling in agriculture. Contrary to heavy soil contaminations, Cu availability in soil and bioavailability to soil organisms remain poorly documented in the context of long-term OR recycling where soil contamination is moderate. The ecotoxicity of Cu depends both on its availability in soil and its bioavailability for soil organisms. In the case of long-term OR applications, Cu availability will be driven by the level of contamination and by temporal evolution of key soil physical-chemical properties such as pH and organic matter content. In the meantime Cu ecotoxicity will depend on the bio-influence of soil organisms on the soil volume they explore i.e. the rhizosphere for plants and the drilosphere for earthworms. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of long-term OR applications on Cu availability in soil and Cu bioavailability to plants and earthworms. A hundred soil samples were selected from four decadal field trials (chronosequences) receiving either no fertilization, mineral fertilization, or organic fertilization and then exhibiting contrasted soil properties. In addition to soil properties we determined Cu availability in each soil sample following (i) a kinetic approach based on the diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) and (ii) an equilibrium approach based on the measurements of total Cu concentration and Cu2+ activity in soil solution. The drivers of Cu speciation in soil solution were assessed by modelling using the windermere humic aqueous model (WHAM). On the hundred soil samples a sub-selection of thirty soil samples were then exposed to plants (Festuca arrundinaceae) and earthworms (Dichogaster saliens) in biotests. Copper availability in the rhizosphere and drilosphere was measured as detailed above and Cu bioavailability was determined by measuring Cu uptake flux in plants and earthworms. The soil chronosequence analyses revealed a temporal increase of pH and dissolved organic matter (DOM) that led to an increase in Cu total concentration and a decrease of Cu2+ in soil solution, while DGT-available Cu was not significantly altered. The action of soil organisms, as compared to bulk soil, led to pH further increased while DOM decreased in the rhizosphere and the drilosphere. These evolutions of pH and DOM in the rhizosphere and the drilosphere led to a decrease in total Cu concentration and Cu2+ in soil solution compared to the bulk soil. Copper uptake flux in plants and earthworms revealed that Cu bioavailability to earthworms and plants were not significantly different under long-term organic or mineral or no fertilization. All these results were consistent with the hypothesis that long-term applications of OR, while inducing a chronical soil Cu contamination, still have a protective effect towards Cu ecotoxicity in soil by decreasing Cu availability in soil under physical-chemical and biological control.

In Europe, 60% of sewage sludge is applied on agricultural soils as a fertilizer. The objective of the present study was to study the effect of AgNPs on soil microbial community composition after sewage sludge application on agricultural soils. To this end, an agricultural soil was amended with sewage sludge containing sulfidized Ag-NPs at low and high dose (18 and 400 mg Ag kg-1 sludge, respectively), and with control sludge with no addition of Ag-NPs (14 mg Ag kg-1 sludge). Resulting Ag content in the amended soil were 1.8, 40 and 1.4 mg Ag kg-1 soil, respectively. The amended soils were planted with two types of crop plants, a monocot (wheat, Triticum aestivum) and a dicot (rape, Brassica napus). We monitored microbial activities involved in C, N and P cycling in unplanted soil and in the rhizosphere and we analysed the bacterial community structure by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes in the unplanted soil, rhizospheric soil and root compartment for the different sludge treatments. Phenoloxidase and peroxidase activities decreased in both low and high dose Ag treatments, these enzymes mediate in carbon and nitrogen cycles in soils. On the other hand we saw that α-diversity was only affected in bulk soils from high dose treatment. More differences were found in β-diversity depending on treatment, plant species and the compartment studied. Cannonical Redundance Analysis based on Weighted Unifrac Distances showed that in the high dose treatment, Ag was the major variable that shaped bacterial communities in all compartments studied. However in the low dose treatment we found differences depending on the plant species and the compartement. Root microbiota was more affected than microbiota from the rhizosphere. The effect of Ag treatments on the abundance of specific taxons will also be discussed. Effects on microbial communities will be discussed in light of data on Ag speciation and availability.

Common problems are related to phytotoxicity, introduction into the food chain and groundwater contamination. Assessing the associations between OW-borne Zn and the soil matrix is paramount to predict its short- and long-term behavior in the environment. This is usually pursued by using either single/sequential extractions (SSE) or spectroscopic methods such as XAS. Nevertheless, SSE reflects element extractability rather than the nature of its interactions with bearing phases, while XAS requires synchrotron radiation sources that are not available in certain regions of the world. We applied a third approach in this study – namely soil density fractionation – to isolate and characterize the constituents of the soil matrix (i.e. potential Zn bearing phases) and thereafter identify their associations with natural and OW-borne Zn. The target density fractions were the following: -3, 1.9–2.25 g cm-3, 2.25–2.5 g cm-3, 2.5–2.7 g cm-3, >2.7 g cm-3, plus an extractable fraction. The soil analyzed was a clayey Hapludox soil that received controlled pig slurry applications over 11 years, causing a 2-fold increase in Zn concentration within the surface layer: from 105.8 mg kg-1 of Zn (control soil) to 206.6 mg kg-1 of Zn (amended soil). Among the six selected density fractions, two of them were the most contrasting and representative. (I) The light fraction (-3) contained high OM concentration but accounted for only ~5% of the bulk soil mass. (II) The mineral-rich fraction (2.5–2.7 g cm-3) contained mainly quartz, kaolinite, vermiculite, a small amount of hematite and accounted for ~80% of the soil mass. In the control soil (no pig slurry application), 79.7% of the Zn was found in the mineral-rich 2.5–2.7 g cm-3 fraction. In the soil amended with pig slurry, the proportion of Zn found in the 2.5–2.7 g cm-3 fraction decreased to 57.3%, as Zn was also found in the OMrich -3 fraction (13.2%) and in the extractable fraction (16.6%). Other fractions were less representative in both soils (control and amended). The extractable, -3 and 2.5– 2.7 g cm-3 fractions accounted for roughly 1/3 each of the OW-borne Zn fate in the amended soil. Finally, these results were compared with data we previously reported for the same field experiment using well-stablished SSE and XAS techniques. Density fractionation not only agreed but also complemented the understanding of previous observations. This work demonstrates that density fractionation may be used as either main or complementary approach for assessing the biogeochemistry of TE such as Zn in the context of OW recycling in agricultural soils.

In response to continuously growing demand for animal protein, livestock production generates increasing amounts of manure. In 2017, 1 billion pigs were produced in the World, with approximately half of it in China. Livestock manure treatment and disposal have become a major issue of the present-day agriculture. Spreading this organic-rich amendment on the soil helps improving soil physico-chemical properties and fertility at the same time that allows the manure recycling. Yet, pig and dairy manures are also rich in Cu and Zn. These potentially toxic trace metals are added to the animal feed, but not digested by the animals. Thus, intensive use of pig and dairy manures as amendment has for a consequence massif inputs of Cu and Zn in agricultural soils. In order to anticipate and prevent degradation of agricultural soils amended with livestock manure, it is crucial to understand the sources and the long-term behavior of these exogenous metals. Published works on manure-borne Cu and Zn in soils described rather low plant uptake, contamination of water resources and accumulation within the soil. A few studies, focused on the speciation, showed that Cu and Zn are present as Cu2S and ZnS in the pig manure. However, no ZnS was detected in soils amended with pig slurry, instead, Zn was found to be adsorbed on clay minerals and iron ox-hydroxides. In addition, none of these studies was able to differentiate between natural and exogenous trace elements. We have investigated manure-amended soils and the corresponding pig and dairy manures applied over several years in three experimental sites located in Brazil. We have analyzed Cu and Zn concentrations and isotopic compositions aiming at evaluating the potential of stable Cu and Zn isotopes as tracers of exogenous metal transformation and redistribution in soils. We observed that livestock manure amendments have rather homogeneous Zn isotopic compositions but show differences in Cu isotopic compositions, depending on the type of waste (pig slurry or dairy manure). Furthermore, Cu and Zn isotopic compositions of the soils that have received large amounts of manure amendments are (i) different from those of the control soil and (ii) intermediate between the isotopic compositions of the control soil and the manure applied. Thus, although the original isotopic signature of a given manure is most likely modified after spreading on the soil, the input of manure-borne Cu and Zn can be detected in soils, particularly in the case of massive treatments. These preliminary results show that stable Cu and Zn isotopes represent a promising tool for studying the behavior of exogenous trace elements from organic-rich amendments. Further application of this approach opens new perspectives, particularly for investigating target mineral phases and long-term behavior of these metal in soils, as well as for tracing the source of contamination in areas without monitoring history.

Yu*a,b a Institute of Surface-Earth System Science, Tianjin University, China bJiangsu Provincial Key Lab for Organic Solid Waste Utilization, College of Resources & Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, China sunfusheng@tju.edu.cn Zinc (Zn) is an essential micronutrient that is generally deficient in soils to accommodate plant needs. Therefore, it is imperative to enhance the concentration and availability of Zn in soils and plants through fertilization. Currently, however, the binding characteristics and fate of Zn in soils under various fertilization regimes remain unclear. Here, two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy (2DCOS) and synchrotron-radiation-based spectro-microscopies were used to identify functional groups responsible for Zn binding in soils following different fertilization treatments. The results showed that a 23-year long-term manure application significantly increased the concentrations of Zn in both soil and corn grain as compared to those having received a traditional inorganic NPK treatment. The 2DCOS analysis of FTIR spectra showed that aliphatic C mainly contributed to Zn binding in the NPK-treated soils, whereas Si-O groups played a dominant role for Zn binding in the manure-treated soils. In soil dissolved organic matter, Zn2+ was first bound with Fe-O, followed by aliphatic C and polysaccharide C in the NPK treatment, but bound with aliphatic C-H prior to Si-O in the manure treatment. Furthermore, synchrotron-radiation-based FTIR and μ-XRF spectromicroscopies indicated that the distribution of Zn, clay minerals, sesquioxides and C functional groups was heterogeneous at the micro-scale, suggesting a heterogeneous binding site for Zn in soils. Using μ-XRF spectromicroscopies, a strong spatial correlation at the submicron scale between Fe and Zn was found in soils, suggesting that Fe-bearing minerals, likely Fe (hydr) oxides, contributed binding sites for Zn. Together, these results indicate that combining 2DCOS and synchrotron-radiation-based spectromicroscopies yields useful information for exploring the binding mechanisms among micronutrients, minerals and organic components in soils, particularly revealing how binding sites for micronutrients in soils can be modified according to fertilization regime.

Grenoble Alpes, France b CNAM, Laboratoire d’analyses chimiques et bio analyses, Paris Cedex 3, France lorenzo.spadini@univ-grenoble-alpes.fr Most antibiotics (ABs) are variable charge ligands, which possess metal complexing functional groups. They consequently bind to soil in various modes, e.g. pH-dependent complexation, ion exchange, hydrophobic interactions. This variability and the complexity of the soil make the prediction of AB sorption on soils a challenging task. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is a sulfonamide-class antibiotics. Its binding modes on a silty-loam soil were studied by combining batch and column experiments at varying organic matter (manure, percentage scale) amendment levels and at varying metal (Cu(II) and Zn(II)) contaminations. The site density of both soil and manure was equated to their proton sorption capacity between pH 4 to 10. That of manure (1.2 mmol/g) is 12 times higher than that of the 2% OM containing soil (0.1 mmol/g). In batch experiments the concentration of sorbed SMX ( 0.003 ≤ [SMXads] ≤ 1 µmol/g) increased with the site density equally in both soil and manure, and also equally in manure-amended soil. This shows that both substrates have a similar substrate-SMX sorption strength. These results combined to results performed on pure humic acids (site density of 2.4 mmol/g) indicate that OM is the soil phase of dominant reactivity toward SMX. The sorption of SMX increased in copper- and zinc-contaminated soils. Quantitative speciation analysis of the SMX-soil-metal-pH system involving variable pH sorption experiments and a minimum number of adjustable constants were performed. Metals form strong binding sites on the soil surface; SMX binds preferably as a ternary SMX-metal-soil complex. Overall, in batch experiments the effects of metals and OM additions on SMX sorption are quantitatively predictable. In contrary the SMX reactive transport experiments in columns do not agree with this ‘predictivity scenario’. On the reference soil in the columns the amount of sorbed SMX slightly decreases compared to the predictions from batches. That expected result likely relates to a more difficult access of SMX to the sites in the aggregated soil. But unexpectedly, in the soil amended with manure the amount of sorbed SMX did not increase but decrease. Moreover, still contrary to batches, the contamination of the soil with metals does not increase the amount of sorbed SMX. These observations relate probably to a concentration effect of organic matter. In the column the OM from manure may completely imprison metals and close access to micropores thus decreasing dramatically the sites accessible to SMX sorption. Such effects appear plausible when considering the ductility of organic matter as highlighted from molecular dynamics calculations. The combination of batch and column experiments appears to be a valuable frame for determining the predominant sorption modes of organic ligands on complex soil substrates.

However, their intrinsic novel properties represent also a challenge on understanding their fate and behaviour in the environment. This is the case of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2NPs), since they are increasingly used in many commercial products (e.g. sunscreens, cosmetics, paints and plastics). 50,400 tons of TiO2-NPs were globally produced in 2010, making these NPs some of the most produced in the world. Thus, it is important to determine their potential harmful effects they may have on ecosystems and health once released into the environment. Previous studies have shown that TiO2-NPs induce genotoxicity in cells, mainly through the generation of oxidative stress. In addition, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) concluded that TiO2-NPs are potentially carcinogenic (respiratory exposure). An important environmental concern is their release into wastewaters, ending up in the sludge produced in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). With the increasing use of WWTPs sludge as amendment in agricultural soils, a depth characterization of TiO2-NPs in sludge samples is necessary for assessing potential environmental risks. This work aims to the physical and chemical characterization of TiO2-NPs present in the sludge of WWTPs. The sludge samples were collected from WWTPs in the State of Chihuahua, Mexico. This state is territorially located in semi-desert zone, a climatic condition that causes the habit of the population to use sunscreen or moisturizers daily (often containing TiO2-NPs).

Therefore, it is relevant to assess the environmental risk of OW agricultural recycling regarding soil contamination by Zn. Zn speciation in OW is a key parameter to evaluate its fate in environment and toxicity to living organisms. We have previously shown that Zn speciation changes radically according to the treatment applied to OW (anaerobic digestion and composting). Nanosized zinc sulphide (nano-ZnS) is the main Zn species in OW after anaerobic digestion, i.e. in digestates. Whereas Zn speciation is dominated by amorphous Zn phosphate and Zn sorbed to ferrihydrite in composts. We also showed that Zn speciation in OW drive Zn availability in an OW-amended soil. As anaerobic digestion and composting are gaining interest in many countries, it is crucial to: assess the fate of Zn following organic waste application on soil, with a particular emphasis on nano-ZnS determine the biogeochemical drivers that control this fate. A mechanistic approach was developed at the microcosm scale. First, we sampled OW on a full-scale plant at four different steps of the treatment. A clayey soil was incubated with the four OW samples having contrasted Zn speciation (0 to 100% nano-ZnS). In a second experiment, nano-ZnS enriched with 68Zn were synthesized to discriminate Zn released by nano-68ZnS dissolution from natural Zn in soil. Two soils with contrasted characteristics were incubated with the nano-68ZnS: the previous clayey soil and a sandy soil. In both experiments, Zn availability patterns was assessed in situ and over one to three months with the technique of the diffusive gradient in thin film (DGT). The results showed that: (i) Zn availability in the amended soil was positively correlated with the percentage of nano-ZnS in OW, (ii) Zn availability is controlled by soil characteristics, as significant differences were detected for the sandy soil and the clayey soil. Therefore, Zn speciation in OW and soil characteristics must be considered when assessing the environmental impact of agricultural recycling regarding Zn contamination.

In the case of permeable aerated soils, arsenic is known to accumulate on iron oxides, causing therefore low leaching and availability. In semi-arid calcareous environments, however, arsenic could be readily mobile and available due to the relatively low content of iron oxides and the solubility of calcite and gypsum. To investigate the leaching and availability of arsenic in agricultural calcareous and gypsic soils with a history of irrigation with arsenic-contaminated water from metallurgical contamination, we collected samples of agricultural surface (0-30 cm) and vertical (0-60 cm) soil to determine total arsenic concentration, water soluble arsenic, and soil mineralogy. Surface soil samples were collected from 0 to 30 cm, while vertical soil samples were collected every 10 cm. We then determined the permeability of the soils by measuring, in-situ, soil moisture using a soil moisture meter and soil electrical resistivity using geophysical methods to further estimate particle size distribution and hydraulic conductivity. Next, we determined the availability of arsenic to maize (Zea mays), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) crops in greenhouse experiments. We also determined bioconcentration and translocation of arsenic within the different crops. We found arsenic enrichment in agricultural soils up to 185 mg/kg, which is up to 5 times higher than the background concentrations of 35 mg/kg and 8.5 times higher than Mexican guideline for agricultural soils. Furthermore, we found that arsenic leaches consistently along the soil profile ( 80 mgAs/kg, on average, from 0 to 60 cm) despite being only semipermeable (from 0.002 cm/h to 1.23 cm/h). Arsenic leaching was attributed to a high solubility of arsenic in water (10% of total arsenic, on average), highlighting a risk for arsenic uptake which, in fact, caused high toxicity (necrosis, reduced growth, chlorosis, or death) in sunflower, alfalfa, and maize plants as well as high bioconcentration and translocation. Results from study contribute to understanding leaching and availability of arsenic in semipermeable, semi-arid environments where knowledge is very limited.

The reduction of Se(VI) and Se(IV) in microorganisms is a key process in the biogeochemical cycle, but little is known about the molecular mechanisms of toxic Se(VI)/Se(IV) reduction to low or nontoxic Se(0) nanoparticles (SeNPs) under aerobic conditions. In this study, four strains of aerobic bacteria were used as the research materials by using morphological, molecular biology, in vitro enzymology and so on. The main results are as follows. (i) Se(VI) reduction was catalyzed by multiple enzymes of the sulfate reducing pathway in Comamonas testosteroni S44. The Se(VI) was pumped by sulfate transporter into the cytoplasm, where Se(VI) was reduced to Se(IV) and then to Se(0). Trace selenium was converted into organic selenium Se(-II). (ii) It was elucidated that multiple pathways are present for dissimilated reduction of Se(IV) in bacteria, encompassing glutathione reduction pathway in Pseudomonas stutzeri TS44 and Streptomyces sp. ES2-5, a novel selenite reductase SerT in periplasm of C. testosteroni S44, glutathione reductase GorA in strain TS44 and a novel Cr(VI)/Se(IV) reductase CsrF in Alishewanella sp.WH16-1. In conclusion, these results reveal that Se(VI)/Se(IV) are reduced both for assimilation at trace level and detoxification under higher concentrations in bacteria. It is also revealed that diverse mechanisms of Se(IV) detoxification are present in bacteria, even in a strain, including generally glutathione involved mechanism and specially enzyme catalyzed mechanism, and different Se(IV) reductases in various bacteria. Consequently, it is a great challenge to study biological processes of selenium in environment by using marker genes. However, it implies that more mechanisms of Se(IV) reduction need to be elucidated in future.

Rice is the most important Selenium(Se) exposure source to local residents in Enshi, however, the translocation of Se in the soil-rice system remains poorly understood. The present study assessed the major Se fractions in Se-rich soils and which soil Se fractions are bioavailable for rice plants grown in Enshi. Rice plants and corresponding rhizosphere soils were collected throughout Enshi. Different soil Se fractions were extracted using sequential chemical extraction method. Soil organic matter (SOM) and soil pH were measured to understand their influences on Se transformation in soils. The concentration and bioaccumulation factors were investigated to understand the translocation of Se from soil to rice. The results showed that soil Se fractions are largely controlled by soil organic matter (SOM) contents. Decomposition of organic matter results in low SOM levels, which promote the transformation of organic-bound Se to water-soluble Se and ligand-exchangeable Se. Water-soluble, ligand-exchangeable and organic-bound Se fractions are the major sources of Se in rice tissues in Enshi. The structural equation modeling(SEM) applied in this study also support our conclusions well. This study will provide insights on biogeochemistry of Se in seleniferous area.

Guizhou province is located in the karst center, south western of China. Rich in mineral resources and characterized by high geological background of trace metals. Therefore, research on micro-interface processes of heavy metal in typical pollution areas of Guizhou can provide scientific basis for prevention and control of heavy metals pollution in Guizhou. The difference of spatial and temporal distribution of heavy metals in rainfall and surface runoff in Huilong catchment and Chenqi catchment is obviously. The trace elements(Hg、Tl、 As、 Sb、Cd、Pb、Zn and Mn in this work) content of rainfall and surface runoff in Huilong catchment is higher than that in Chenqi, and heavy metal content in the dry season (Oct-Apr) is higher than rainy season (May-Sep). The next step is to combine the rainfall and runoff data to calculate the annual heavy metal input and output fluxes for the two small watersheds. The distribution of heavy metals in soil profiles is quite different. Some elements` distribution trend (such as mercury and thallium in Huilong catchment, R2=0.78) is similar, which may be related to parent rock background, soil formation process and external input. The relationship of trace elements mobility with other parameters (multi-element concentrations in soils, SOM, CEC, pH and redox potential) will be discussed.

China, b Geomicrobiology, Center for Applied Geoscience, University of Tuebingen, Germany Chendandan_soil@163.com Iron is the fourth most abundant element in Earth’s crust as well as the most prevalent redox-active metal in the biosphere. Microbially mediated redox processes of Fe and N cycles by nitrate-reducing Fe(II) oxidizing (NRFO) bacteria are extremely complicated. There are three different types of NRFO bacteria according to the types of metabolism, autotrophs, heterotrophs and mixotrophs. NRFO autotrophs do not require an organic electron donor as a co-substrate but use CO2 as a sole carbon source, and nitrate reduction is coupled with the Fe(II) oxidation using Fe(II) as a sole electron donor. NRFO heterotrophs need organic electron donors to biologically reduce nitrate, but Fe(II) oxidation occurs by just chemical processes with an intermediate of nitrate reduction (nitrite or NO); hence, most NRFO heterotrophs are denitrifying bacteria. NRFO mixotrophs can directly reduce nitrate in the presence of organic electron donors via heterotrophic processes, and simultaneously, the co-existing Fe(II) can also donate electrons to nitrate via autotrophic processes. To understand the processes of NRFO well, model strains with different types of metabolism were used to study the elementary reactions and N/O isotope fractionation of nitrate and nitrite in different conditions. Autotrophic NRFO enrichment culture KS, heterotrophic NRFO bacteria Pseudogulbenkiania sp. strain 2002 and mixotrophic NRFO bacteria Acidovorax sp. strain BoFeN1 were used, and a simple model was established to evaluate the relative contributions of the involved chemical and biological reactions. The results showed no nitrite was detected during the processes of NRFO mediated by culture KS, and nitrate reduction and Fe(II) oxidation were mainly supported by biological processes. For strain 2002, nitrate reduction was mediated by biological process and Fe(II) oxidation was mediated by chemical processes. For strain BoFeN1, the electrons used to reduce nitrate were from both of Fe(II) and acetate, indicating that both biological and chemical processes were involved in. The elementary reactions, N/O isotopic fractionation and simple models would help understanding the complicated processes of NRFO in the anoxic environments.

In order to do so, various environmental medias were collected surrounding the Dabaoshan Mine in China. We measure Zn isotope radio to trace the sources of the metals. The δ66Zn/64Zn values are heavy in ore, suspended sediment and surface water (from 0.28 to 0.3‰), whereas the paddy topsoil and fly ash have lighter δ66Zn/64Zn isotope ratios (from -0.26 to -0.17‰). Meanwhile, we also measured the Zn isotope radio of a paddy soil profile, which shows that the isotope radio of plow pan layer (0.26‰) is obviously heavier than the plough layer (-0.06‰). This suggests that Zn pollution in the paddy soils was mainly caused by the deposition of fly ash during anthropogenic activities (mining and refining) and irrigation water from surface water. Besides, fly ash make a greater contribution to the plough layer than the plow pan layer. On the contrary, the irrigation is the main source of the Zn in the plow pan layer. Selective sequential extraction method was used to distinguish the content of different fractions of heavy metal. The results show that Zn mainly associated with reducible Fe-Mn oxides (12.0%-68.7%), followed by exchangeable (1.1%-50.0%). X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD) and 57Fe Mössbauer spectrum reveal that the mainly Fe-Mn oxides in the paddy soils are goethite and amorphous Fe oxide, which easily adsorb Zn2+ ion. Therefore, adsorption maybe the main way which heavy metal Zn bond to the Fe oxide in our study area.

The application of green manure (GM) to soils with low Zn availability can increase the transfer of Zn from soil to wheat, however, this practice can also influence the plant availability of the toxic metal cadmium (Cd). We tested the effect of GM addition on the transfer of Zn and Cd from soil to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). To obtain GM, sunflower (Helianthus annus L.) was grown and labeled with 67Zn and 111Cd in hydroponics. In a pot trial, different quantities of milled sunflower were amended as GM to a soil that either was fertilized with ZnSO4 (high Zn availability) or not fertilized (low Zn availability). The soil solution was frequently analyzed during wheat growth and the wheat was harvested at flowering and full maturity. Isotope ratios (67/66Zn and 111/110Cd) of purified soil solution and wheat samples were analyzed with Q-ICP-MS. The addition of GM to soil increased wheat root and shoot biomass as well as pH and total nitrogen (TN) in the soil solution. Furthermore, GM increased N concentrations in the wheat shoots and initially also dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in the soil solution. The average Zn concentration in wheat grains were higher in soils with high than with low Zn availability (high Zn: 101 ± 1.9 mg kg-1, low Zn 28 ± 0.9 mg kg-1). However, the reverse pattern was found for Cd (high Zn: 0.15 ± 0.01 mg kg-1, low Zn: 0.437 ± 0.01 mg kg-1). No significant effect of GM addition on shoot and grain Zn and Cd concentration was observed due to increased biomass (dilution effect). However, the transfer of Zn and Cd into wheat shoots strongly increased with the application of GM to soils with low Zn availability (Zn: from 67 to 121 µg, Cd: from 1.51 to 2.74 µg). In these soils, isotope mass balances revealed that the increased transfer was mainly caused by an indirect effect through solubilization of these metals from the bulk soil (Zn: + 39 µg, Cd: + 1.07 µg), but also directly through the addition of the metals with GM (Zn: + 16 µg, Cd: + 0.16 µg). Our data suggest that the increased soil-plant transfer of Zn and Cd was mainly caused by the decomposition of GM that (i) released organic compounds which solubilized Zn and Cd from the bulk soil, (ii) improved N supply in the initial phase of wheat growth, which led to a better soil exploitation and enhanced root exudates. This study showed that GM amendments to soils can increase the soil-wheat transfer of Zn but also the transfer of Cd. A combination of agronomic biofortification measures, such as GM addition and mineral Zn fertilization could contribute to a healthier balance of Zn and Cd in wheat grains.

Two separate semi-mechanistic models (Sqrt- and Ln-model), have been developed to predict short- and long-term aging of Ni added to soils. To continuously predict Ni aging in one model, a semi-mechanistic model (Erfc-model) was developed in the present study with description of diffusion process using a complementary error function. The developed Erfc-model could predict Ni aging processed for short- and long-term aging continuously with regression coefficients (R2) of 0.87 and 0.94, which were very comparable with that for Sqrt- (0.91) and Ln-model (0.89). Based on the Erfc-model, soil pH and aging time were two important factors that influencing Ni aging processes. Additional 45 soils that covering short- and long aging time were collected to validate the model. Strong correlation (R2=0.85) was found between the measured and predicted lability of Ni in soils with root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 8.97%, illustrating that the Erfc-model could continuously predict short- and long-term aging processes of Ni added to soils.

The direct interplay between aqueous Fe(II) (Fe(II)aq) and the structural Fe(III) in iron (hydr)oxide is the recently found important process of soil iron cycle. Previous studies focused on the chemical mechanism of Fe(II)aq-induced recrystallization and phase transformation of iron (hydr)oxide. However, microorganism often coexists with iron (hydr)oxide in the soil environment, and plays an important role in the iron cycle process. The effect of microorganisms, especially iron-reducing bacteria, on the interplay between Fe(II)aq and the structural Fe(III), and the phase transformation of iron (hydr)oxide remain unclear. In this study, we focus on the effect of iron-reducing bacteria, Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (hereafter MR-1), and herein the influencing mechanisms on the phase transformation of lepidocrocite induced by Fe(II)aq. Enriched 57Fe isotope tracer studies demonstrate that Fe(II)aq undergoes electron transfer and atom exchange with lepidocrocite, and results in 63.5% of structural Fe(III) atoms in lepidocrocite exchanging with 1.0 mM Fe(II)aq in solution at pH 7.0 for 23 days. XRD analysis results show that part of lepidocrocite is transformed into goethite after 23 days incubation. Interestingly, amended with Fe(II)aq and active cells (MR-1), lepidocrocite can be reduced and the concentration of Fe(II) in solution increases quickly, which further enhance the rate of Fe atom exchange. Lepidocrocite is transformed into magnetite during this process. However, Mössbauer analysis results show that lepidocrocite could be recrystallized as lepidocrocite and goethite after incubation 23 days in the abiotic experiment of Fe(II)aq and lepidocrocite, and lepidocrocite, goethite and magnetite were found in the presence of MR-1. Hence, we could infer that the presence of iron-reducing bacteria could change the Fe(II)aq concentration which would further change the iron atom exchange and phase transformation of lepidocrocite. The initial Fe(II)aq could exchange with lepidocrocite directly, and lepidocrocite was recrystallized as lepidocrocite and goethite; or coupled with Fe(II)aq produced by iron-reducing bacteria, exchanged with structural Fe(III), and lepidocrocite was recrystallized as magnetite.

The fate and mobility of As in paddy ecosystems are controlled by the following processes: (1) adsorption and desorption of As, (2) coupled redox reaction of Mn, Fe, and As, and (3) precipitation and dissolution of As-bearing iron oxides. It is difficult to distinguish how each individual process contributes to the overall As releasement under field conditions. However, numerical model can provide an alternative approach for cost-effective evaluation of Individual progress controlling As releasement as long as the general field parameters were given. Here, we selected two typical research areas from a typical karst basin in Hengxian, Guangxi. One is near Zhenlongjiang river and composed of Quaternary sediments (Yunbiao, YB) and the other locates on the Devonian in the center of a karst basin (Maling, ML). The basic physical and chemical properties of the soils were characterised. Adsorption experiments of arsenite (As (III)) and arsenate (As (V)) on the soils including adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms and pH edges were conducted to evaluate the adsorption capacity of the soil and provide parameters for the surface complexation model (SCM). Redox cycling experiments consisting of a reduction period (0~20d), an oxidation period (20~30d) and a second reduction period (30~50d) were performed to simulate the coupled adsorption and redox processes under flooding and drainage conditions in the paddy fields. The species and concentrations of As, Fe, and Mn in the aqueous and solid phases were analyzed at the selected time. Adsorption experiments showed that: (1) As (V) adsorption kinetics was faster than As (III); (2) the adsorption capacity of the soils in ML was higher than that in YB because of difference in Fe and Mn concentrations; (3) in YB, the adsorption capacity of the soils from the dry land was significantly lower than that from the paddy field, whereas such phenomenon was not observed in ML; Redox cycling experiments showed that (1)the concentration of As in the liquid phase decreased in ML while the concentration of As increased in YB paddy soils probably due to difference in the contents of Mn in the first reduction period;(2) the trends were the same afterwards, showing that the immobilization of As was strengthened in the oxidation period and the release of As in the second reduction period was enhanced. In the future research, the variation of arsenic species during the redox cycles will be analyzed to better understand the processes that will influence As releasement during agricultural irrigation management in the paddy fields.

Little research has examined the transport, retention, and remobilization of MWCNTs in the presence or absence of SDBS in porous media with controlled chemical heterogeneity, and batch and column scale studies were therefore undertaken to address this gap in knowledge. The adsorption isotherms of SDBS on quartz sand (QS), goethite coated quartz sand (GQS), and MWCNTs were determined. Adsorption of SDBS (MWCNTs >> GQS > QS) decreased zeta potentials for these materials, and produced a charge reversal for goethite. Transport of MWCNTs (5 mg/L) dramatically decreased with an increase in the fraction of GQS from 0 to 0.1 in the absence of SDBS. Conversely, co-injection of SDBS (10 and 50 mg/L) and MWCNTs radically increased the transport of MWCNTs when the GQS fraction was 0, 0.1, and 0.3, especially at a higher SDBS concentration, and altered the shape of retention profile. Mathematical modeling revealed that competitive blocking was not the dominant mechanism for the SDBS enhancement of MWCNT transport. Rather, SDBS sorption increased MWCNT transport by increasing electrostatic and/or steric interactions, or creating reversible interactions on rough surfaces. Sequential injection of pulses of MWCNTs and SDBS in sand (0.1 GQS fraction) indicated that SDBS could mobilize some of retained MWCNTs from the top to deeper sand layers, but only a small amount of released MWCNTs were recovered in the effluent. SDBS therefore had a much smaller influence on MWCNT transport in sequential injection than in co-injection, presumably because of a greater energy barrier to MWCNT release than retention. This research sheds novel insight on the roles of competitive blocking, chemical heterogeneity and nanoscale roughness, and injection sequence on MWCNT retention and release.

Despite the significance of Cr(VI) in the environment, there is currently an uncomplete understanding of its behavior under certain environmental conditions. To further investigate this sediment cores with highly elevated concentrations of Cr(VI) were obtained from the E.C. Electroplating Superfund Site, Garfield, NJ. Sediment samples were then characterized using both aqueous and in-situ techniques. Cr stability and sorption mechanisms were determined in a stirred-flow chamber utilizing competing electrolyte solutions of various molarities. The effluent was speciated for Cr(III), Cr(VI) and co-released metals via Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to quantify Cr release levels over the course of the reaction.

Luo CAS Key Laboratory of Soil Environment and Pollution Remediation, Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China ymluo@issas.ac.cn During last three decades, China experienced rapid development of industrialization, urbanization, and agricultural intensification, resulting in entrance of large quantities of metal pollutants into rural and urban soil environment through multiple pathways, causing agricultrual and industrial land pollution. Both basic and technological reseraches for either better understanding of biogeochemistry or for development of risk reduction technology, of toxic metals in soil and groundwater are urgently required for safeguard of food quality and human health. In the 1970s, China soil environmental protection focused on preventing metal pollution of the agricultural soil in sewage irrigated areas. In the 1980s, significant progress was made in the research on pollution control of heavy metals, especially arsenic and chromium. In the early 1990s, the soil metal background values on a national scale and its regional differentiation were determined. The National Soil Environmental Quality Standard was enacted in 1995 to provide a basis for soil environmental management and metal pollution prevention in particular, and the research on phytoremediation of metal polluted soil was started in the mid-1990s. From the twenty-first century, the National “973” Program for basic research, the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), and the Knowledge Innovation Projects of Chinese Academy of Sciences funded many research projects on soil metal biogeochemistry, soil environmental quality evolution and soil risk assessment. Remediation technologies for metal polluted site soil and groundwater were embraced into the National “863” Program for “Hi-Tech” development. Ten years ago, a national-wide soil pollution survey and prevention project was carried out, and the soil pollution status at a national scale was mapped. These projects stimulated the national development of soil pollution risk management and remediation, including the preliminary establishment of risk reduction technology systems of heavy metals-polluted soil and groundwater, such as stabilisation, oxidation/reduction, washing, reactive barrier, electrodynamics, phytoremediation, microbial remediation, and combination technoloies. In the future, the continuing implementation of “China Action Plan for Soil Pollution Prevention and Control” and the “National Key Research and Development Program” will further and greatly promote reserach and development of biogeochemistry knowledge and risk reduction technology of metal pollutants, improve the capacity for soil environmental governance and effectively enhance China’s industrial development in the soil remediation.

Concentrations of total Hg (THg) and methylmercury (MeHg) were measured to show regional dispersion of Hg contamination. Sequential extraction for different Hg species: water-soluble (F1), potassium hydroxide-extractable (F2, fulvic acids-FAs), potassium hydroxide-extractable (F3, humic acids-HAs), nitric acid-extractable (F4), and residual (F5) fractions in gangue, sediment, and soil were investigated as well. High THg concentrations obtained in gangues from mining areas, ranged from 0.37 to 35 mg/kg with an average of 11±8.4 mg/kg. Similarly, sediment samples ranged from 0.15 to 19 mg/kg in THg and from 0.036 to 7.8 ng/g in MeHg. THg concentrations in soils were generally low varying from 0.16 to 0.91 mg/kg, but MeHg concentrations were highly elevated ranging from 0.71 to 11 ng/g. THg and MeHg concentrations in surface water varied from 1.0 to 11 ng/L and 0.008 to 0.37 ng/L, respectively. Rice samples exhibited wide ranges varying from 3.0 to 22 ng/g in THg and from 0.71 to 8.9 ng/g in MeHg. Sequential extraction results showed that fraction F4 was the dominant Hg species in both gangue and sediment, while F3 was the dominant form in soil. Concentrations of n-HAs (difference between total organic carbon (TOC) and HAs) in soil were positively correlated with THg and MeHg in both soil and rice, indicating its Hg bioavailability under certain acidic conditions. The spatial distribution patterns of Hg contamination in the local environment suggested Hg is derived from gangues that dumped and introduced into river banks during historic coal mining activities.

Chen School of Environmental Science and Engineering, Fujian Normal University, China jjlin@fjnu.edu.cn In recent years, soil heavy metal cadmium (Cd) contamination has emerged as a serious environmental problem in China. The remediation of Cd contaminated soil has become the focus of research. This research provides a stabilization technology to in situ remediation of Cd soil. Phytogenic iron oxide nanoparticles (PION) was used as the stabilizer for the stabilization of Cd in paddy soil. Firstly, the synthesis and characterization of PION; Secondly, the effect of different dosages of PION on the stabilization of Cd in soil; Thirdly, the stabilization of Cd under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions were investigated. Scanning electron microscope-maping (SEM-maping), transmission electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer (TEM-EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was used to characterize the PION. The results show that PION is complex of nanoscale iron oxide and organic carbon chain, which including many organic functional groups, such as -C-O-, -C=O, -OH, -S=O and -NH2. These structures have strong complexation ability to heavy metal cations. PION can effectively immobilize Cd in soil under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, and the efficiency increased with the increase of PION dosage. The stabilization of Cd in flooded soil was much higher than in 50% water hold capacity (WHC). CaCl2 extractable Cd reduced by 77% and 85%. PION increased the activity of urease and catalase under 50% WHC condition, while had no significant effect on them under flooded condition. In contrast, PION enhanced the activity of invertase under flooded condition, whereas had no effects on it under 50% WHC. PION significantly increase the soil pH value, which an increase in pH favours the stabilization of Cd. The content of 0.5 M HCl extractable Fe (II) and amorphous Fe in flooded treatment was significantly higher than that of 50% WHC treatment. However, the content of dithionite-citrate-bicarbonate extractable Fe in 50% WHC treatment was higher than that of flooded treatment. This study provided new insights into the potential effects of PION applications for practical Cd stabilization in contaminated soils.

Bäckströma, and L. Sartza a Man-Technology-Environment Research Centre, Örebro University, Sweden nanna.stahre@oru.se Leaching tests for evaluation of materials for co-disposal, landfilling or use as remediation material is often performed using HCl. But when evaluating a material for acidic sulfide mine waste remediation leaching with HCl is not ideal since the typical ARD often contains high concentrations of sulfate and ferrous iron that have an impact on the mobility of trace elements. Green liquor dregs (GLD) is an alkaline by-product from the paper and pulp industry with a pH between 10 and 14. It mainly consists of non-process elements from the wood pulping, organic material and spent cooking chemicals as well as calcite. Samples were collected from two different mills in the southern part of Sweden (Aspa and Frövi). Frövi adds lime mud (mainly calcite) during the final dewatering of GLD while Aspa does not. Each GLD was leached with three acidic solutions: HCl, H2SO4 and H2SO4+Fe2+ (final Fe2+ concentration 100 mg/L). 11 subsamples of each GLD was added different amounts of leaching solution (including an untreated subsample). Leaching of calcium and lead is strongly affected by the composition of the leaching solution due to the formation of sulfate mineral precipitates. HCl leaches much higher concentrations than H2SO4 and H2SO4+Fe2+. For calcium leaching with H2SO4 regardless of addition of Fe results in calcium reaching a constant concentration of 437 mg/L for Aspa and 432 mg/L for Frövi at or above pH 8. For lead, when lime mud is present, leaching with H2SO4+Fe2+ yields lower leached concentrations than when only using H2SO4. This effect can also be seen for chromium but the HCl leached amount is not as much higher as for calcium and lead. For chromium it can also be seen that from approximately pH 7.75 the leached concentrations from the H2SO4 leached samples decrease linearly to about pH 6.75 where the leached concentrations are at their lowest (the effect is clearer when lime mud is present). This suggest that there is a presence of negatively charged chromium as Cr(VI) and its subsequent reduction to Cr(III). In the presence of lime mud uranium and cadmium leached less when leached with H2SO4 compared to when leached with HCl (5-10% for cadmium, 4-14% for uranium). Addition of Fe gives slightly lower concentrations for uranium and slightly higher concentrations for cadmium. However, these effects are not seen as clearly for uranium when lime mud is not present in the samples and not at all for cadmium. This is attributed to the speciation of uranium ($\\mathrm{\\text{UO}}_{\\mathrm{2}}^{\\mathrm{2 +}}$) forming negative complexes when carbonate and/or sulfate are present. For zinc and cobalt no significant difference was noted for different leaching solutions. pH is lowered by the addition of ferrous iron with around 0.55 to 0.14 pH units. Elements most susceptible to the presence of sulfate, carbonate and ferrous iron are lead and chromium whereas zinc and cobalt are not affected. In conclusion when evaluating an alkaline material through acid leaching for use in reclamation of acidic mine waste it is important to use a leaching solution similar to the ARD and not only HCl in order to not overestimate the leached concentrations of trace elements.

Brewerb, W. Tanga, G.Y. Xua, X. Gao, J. Mao and Y. Qiana a Institute of Soil Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China b Hawaii Department of Health, USA jingsong@issas.ac.cn In recent years, brownfield sites have become an important source of land for urban redevelopment in major Chinese cities. According to Chinese laws, contaminated sites have to be cleaned up before land transaction and redevelopment. National and regional technical guidelines are available to evaluate the performance of remediation. However, current guidelines are based on discrete sampling method. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of pollutant distribution, the representativeness of discrete samples has been proven questionable. In addition, relevant Chinese sampling guidance does not properly evaluate sampling error, which is the major source of error for soil environmental monitoring data. To improve sample representativeness and confidence in analytical data, decision unit multi increment sampling (DUMIS) has been proposed and successfully used for expediting investigation of contaminated sites in the US, Canada and Denmark etc. Yet, it has never been demonstrated in China. The objectives of the present study is to explore the suitability of modified DUMIS in performance evaluation of immobilization of a Ni and Pb contaminated site in China. The demonstration site was a former inorganic salts producer, located in Shandong province, China. Environmental investigation showed that industrial activities and illegal burial of hazardous waste have caused soil contamination of Ni and Pb at the site. Ex-situ immobilization was proposed as the remedy. Contaminated soil was excavated and mixed with immobilizing agent using ALLU sieving and mixing equipment. Treated soil was then piled up for curing followed by confirmation sampling. In compliance with existing Chinese remediation confirmation guidance, decision unit (DU) was set as one DU per 400m2 or 500m3 soil. For each DU, a multi increment sample was taken with a hand auger from top 0-20 cm of 50 subsample points evenly distributed within the DU. In one of the field DU, two sets of triplicates were taken, one by DUMIS method (50 subsample points) and the other by the routine method (9 subsample points). To evaluate the field sampling error, triplicates were taken from 10% of DU in the field. The results showed that the relative standard deviation (RSD) of all field triplicates ranged between 3.8% and 66%. The triplicates with high RSD were collected from pit wall or pit bottom with lumps of Ni containing hazardous waste. This study demonstrated that DUMIS method produces high quality data which greatly improved the confidence in remediation performance evaluation at the site.

Cao State Key Laboratory of Biogeology and Environmental Geology & School of Environmental Studies, of Geosciences, China qhguo2006@gmail.com Nanocrystalline iowaite, a Mg/Fe-based layered double hydroxide (LDH) intercalated with chloride, was synthesized to evaluate its performance for arsenic removal from water and to investigate the contributing dearsenication mechanisms. It is characterized by fast arsenic sorption rates and has a much higher arsenic uptake capacity than other LDHs that are commonly used for water dearsenication. The surface adsorption of the solution arsenic onto the iowaite samples and the anion exchange of the arsenic in solution with chloride, which is originally in the iowaite interlayers, are the primary mechanisms for the uptake of arsenic by iowaite. In addition to the Coulombic attraction between arsenate/arsenite and positively charged layers of iowaite, the inner-sphere complexation of arsenic with Fe (instead of Mg) in the iowaite layers is responsible for the formation of more stable and stronger arsenic bonds, as indicated by both XPS and EXAFS analyses. Specifically, bidentate-binuclear and monodentate-mononuclear As-Fe complexes were detected in the arsenate removal experiments, whereas bidentate-mononuclear, bidentate-binuclear, and monodentate-mononuclear As-Fe complexes were present for the arsenite-treated iowaite samples. This study indicates that Nano-iowaite is a promising material for the treatment of both industrial wastewaters with arsenic concentrations over several hundreds of mg/L and contaminated natural waters with a comparatively lower range of arsenic concentrations (typically from several hundreds of µg/L to several mg/L). For industrial-scale applications, Nano-iowaite must be synthesized as microspheres with a macro porous structure or as a homogeneous mixture with other chemically stable materials, such as quartz sand, so that the material has sufficient diffusion pathways for arsenic-bearing waters. In terms of water dearsenication, one limit of Nano-iowaite is that the final solution is usually alkaline (pH 10 - 11). However, this may be advantageous when Nano-iowaite is used to treat acidic arsenic-rich waters from, for example, acid geothermal discharge or acid mine drainage. By carefully designing the treatment conditions, the final solution pH could be within the neutral range, and arsenic could be efficiently removed from water. One problem possibly occurring during the treatment of acid waters by Nano-iowaite is that it may be not as stable as in alkaline solutions. A systematic test on the stability of Nano-iowaite at wider ranges of pH and arsenic concentration needs to be performed before it will be put into practice in acid water treatment.

One approach to enhance the mobility of nano-particles in an aquifer is to use surface modifiers. In this study, nanoscale magnesia (NMgOs), an innovative and effective remedial material for cadmium (Cd) removal from groundwater, was modified with the negatively charged and eco-friendly humic acid to enhance its mobility in aquifers. A two- dimensional reactor (605010 cm), with 2 injection wells and 30 monitoring wells was designed, constructed, and sand-packed in the laboratory to simulate a saturated aquifer. The simulated aquifer was pre-contaminated with Cd to simulate a plume in groundwater. The distribution of injected un- modified NMgOs and humic acid-modified NMgOs slurry were evaluated in the reactor. The radius of influence (ROI) of humic acid-modified NMgOs was estimated to be approximately 5 cm based on visual observation, while no ROI was apparent for the unmodified NMgOs because of their aggregation at the bottom of the injection wells. The concentrations of Cd and magnesium (Mg) were monitored in all 30 monitoring wells at different time intervals to evaluate the effectiveness of Cd removal. The break- through curve analysis revealed that humic acid enhances the transport of NMgOs in the saturated porous media. Furthermore, the results of scanning electron microscopy-energy dispersive x-ray (SEM-EDX) characterization of silica sand before and after injection of NMgOs verified the presence of 5.78% of Mg from humic acid-modified NMgOs and 0.19% from unmodified NMgOs at 35 cm downgradient of the injection wells, which are consistent with the conclusion drawn from the breakthrough curves.

Zhao and X. Wang School of the Environment, Nanjing University, P.R. China xygu@nju.edu.cn Due to compositional and spatial heterogeneity of soils, it is always a challenge to predict the risks of trace elements in terrestrial system. While, the solid-solution partitioning of metals is a key factor controlling their accumulation, mobility, and bioavailability in soils, it is essential to predict metal partitioning in soil/solution to assess the potential risk of metal leaching and its bioavailability to biomass. Recently, assemblage or multi-surface models were found to be a promising tool to predict trace-element partitioning in soils. The models assume that trace-element adsorption in heterogeneous soils can be described by the sum of the individual reactive surfaces. While due to the model parameters are thermodynamically based, it can be extrapolated to various soils compared with empirical models. In this talk, we will introduce two case study using the multi-surface speciation model to predict metal partitioning and bioavailability. 1) Cr(VI) partitioning in various soils We investigated the adsorption of Cr(VI) on 12 soils (previously depleted of organic matter) as a function of pH and the loading concentration of Cr(VI). A simple mechanism-based multi-surface complexation model is proposed to predict Cr(VI) partitioning. The retention of Cr(VI) in soils was considered to be attributed to two reactive oxide surfaces, goethite, and hydrous ferric oxide (HFO); however, modelling results showed that the best prediction was obtained with goethite alone, whereas the addition of HFO resulted in an overestimation of adsorption in some soils. Cr(VI) adsorption onto goethite could be described using our previously proposed CD-MUSIC model. The available phosphate in soils was identified as a strong competitor for Cr(VI) adsorption; thus, for soils with low Fe/P ratio ( 2) Prediction of partition and bioavailability of Cd(II) and Ni(II) to wheat An improved soil multi-surface speciation model was developed to predict the partition of Cd(II) and Ni(II) in soils. Nineteen selected soils from China with a wide range of varieties spiked with Cd(II) and Ni(II) were used to test the model, while wheat was used as test plant. Adsorption to soil organic matters was evaluated using the NICA-Donnan model and to iron oxides using CD-MUSIC and a two-site DDL model with published model parameters. The partition of Cd(II) and Ni(II) in soil-water phase was evaluated with 0.01M CaCl2 extraction. The phytoaccumulation of Cd(II) and Ni (II) in wheat roots and shoots was evaluated using several methods, such as 0.01M CaCl2, 0.43M HNO3, soil pore water, DGT extraction and modelling. In addition, a set of data from field including soil properties and Cd accumulated in wheat seeds were also used to evaluate the model prediction. The results from both lab and field experiments confirmed that the multi-surface model was an efficient method for metal phyto-accumulation assessment.

Traditional SB backfill is consisted of trench spoils or proper imported soils, water, and sodium bentonite (Na-bentonite) with bentonite content ranging from ~1% to about 6%. However, using low swelling calcium bentonite (Ca-bentonite) is extremely meaningful for countries where high-quality Na-bentonite is scarce while Ca-bentonite is plentiful. Sodium hexametaphosphate (SHMP) has been manifested as an effective amendment for improving workability and hydraulic performances of the Ca-bentonite in SB backfill. However, by date the hydraulic conductivity response of the SB backfill containing SHMP-amended Ca-bentonite to aggressive chemical solutions has not been addressed. This study presented lab-scale investigation of hydraulic conductivity of SB backfill composed of 80% sand and 20% SHMP-amended Ca-bentonite (dry weight basis) in potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) solution with 19.2 mM (1000 mg/L) Cr(VI) concentration. Duplicated flexible-wall hydraulic conductivity tests were conducted using tap water first and followed by the Cr(VI) solution. The volume, pH and electrical conductivity of the inflow and outflow liquids were monitored, and Cr(VI) concentrations in the outflow liquid were measured. The variation in hydraulic conductivity with the pore volume of flow of permeant liquid was assessed. The results show that the hydraulic conductivity maintained a value lower than the commonly used value of 10-9 m/s regardless of the type of permeant liquid, indicating that Cr(VI) solution had insignificant adverse effects during the tested period.

Arsenic contamination in soil has become a major environmental problem worldwide. Many As polluted sites have been reported around the world due to anthropogenic activities, especially mining and smelting operations. In Australia, extremely elevated levels of As have been associated with mine impacted soils, cattle dip sites and railway corridors. Abandoned mining sites are often in close proximity to agricultural land and sensitive ecological areas, such as National Parks. Thus, soil As mobility and bioavailability needs to be managed to reduce offsite migration and potential impacts to proximal receptors. In situ remediation of As contaminated soils is increasingly sought after, yet there are limited options available which are not highly sensitive to changing redox conditions. In this study, we have investigated the efficacy of zirconium (IV) to immobilize As in soil. Twelve As contaminated soils were collected from abandoned mine sites from different areas of Australia. The total As concentration in these soils ranged from 8.3 to 94,000 (median 490) µg/g. Soils were treated using either Milli-Q water or zirconyl chloride solution (soil : solution = 1 : 5) and allowed to react for 6 h. Following the adsorption step, the pH was adjusted to approximately 7 using 0.1 M NaOH, thus precipitating ZrO on the surface of soil colloids. Soils were then equilibrated (10mM NaNO3) for 24 h, soil suspensions centrifuged, filtered (0.22 µm pore size) and analysed for As by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). All analyses were performed in duplicate. Arsenic extractability in untreated soils ranged from 0.9 to 347.8 (median 5.4) µg/g whereas ZrO treated soils ranged from 0.06 to 73.97 (median 0.17) µg/g. The results revealed that ZrO immobilization efficiency of As from polluted samples ranged from 79 to 93%, depending on the soil characteristics. In conclusion, ZrO shows potential for in situ immobilization of As in As contaminated soils. Further research is currently under way to investigate the use of mixed-metal composite frameworks and long-term efficacy in contaminated soils.

In this study, the low-cost zeolite-supported nanoscale zero-valent iron (Z-NZVI) was synthesized from a simplified liquid-phase reduction of iron(III) salts to in-situ simultaneously immobilize the Cd, Pb, and As in the acid and alkaline soils. With a lot of cationic binding sites and mesoporous structures, zeolite had been combined with NZVI to reduce nanoparticle aggregation and improve remediation efficiency. pH of two soils with 30 g kg-1 Z-NZVI amendment significantly increased from 5.1 to 5.8 and 7.9 to 8.1, respectively, due to the oxidation of Fe0 and release of OH-. After 180 d of incubation, compared with control groups, 30 g kg-1 Z-NZVI significantly decreased the available concentrations of Cd, Pb, and As in acid soil by 0.1, 258.4, and 2.1 mg kg-1, which were also significantly decreased in alkaline soil by 1.6, 65.1, and 6.9 mg kg-1. Z-NZVI immobilized DOC and mitigated its decomposition to maintain the higher pH and lower EC in acid and alkaline soils until the end of incubation, hence combining of the advantages of pH-adjusting and adsorption. During the process of incubation, the fractions of these pollutants became more stable. The results of X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectronic spectroscopy supported that arsenic compound (e.g., AsO43-), Cd2+, and Pb2+ were immobilized by the surface FeOx·(OH)3-2x shell and Fe0 of Z-NZVI through co-precipitation, complexation and reduction. Overall, Z-NZVI has great potential for treating farmland soil multi-contaminated with heavy metals.

For this purpose, 11 points of interest were sampled in order to have data on both the gardens close to the installations but also on other spots such as a hiking path. For this purpose, physical-chemical analysis of all samples has been performed (pH, conductivity, CEC, grain size, % of carbonates and organic matter). The bearing phases has been highlighted by µXRD, SEM-EDS and by XANES(SOLEIL synchrotron) experiments. The environmental risk has been evidenced thank to the BCR extraction and the standardized EN-12457 leaching procedure. For the health risk assessment, two steps are required. First, the bioaccessibility procedure UBM, based onto operational chemical methodology mimicking soil ingestion and its stay in the gastrointestinal tract of the human body, was realized then, some scenario was chosen to assess the non-carcinogenic heath risk for children and adults Hazard Quotient (HQ) for Zn, Cd, Pb, As and carcinogenic risk for As. Whatever the type of samples studied, a contamination in Pb, Zn and As is effective. The main contamination is shown for gardens soils with values up to 1500 mg kg-1, 4000 mg kg-1, 150 mg kg-1 in Pb, Zn, As, respectively. The nature of bearing phases is quite similar whatever the samples, and is constituted by micro to nanoparticles of franklinite, and polymetallic-iron oxides, and affined by coupling µXRF, SEM and XANES. The sequential BCR extractions showed a common behavior between zinc and cadmium, with a high proportion of easily mobilizable fraction (F1). For Pb, the reducible and oxidizable fraction are predominantly representing approximately 30% each. Arsenic is link to the residual fraction, indicating a long-term stability in soils. These results correlate with the UBM bioaccessibility results highlighting that zinc and cadmium reach about 60% of bioaccessibility. For Pb, the average is about 40%. XAS experiment were also done onto each phase after extraction (i.e. onto solid and also liquid extraction) and confirm the data allowing to determine and quantify the specific dissolution phases. With the chosen residential exposure scenario, the risk threshold (Hazard Quotient) is very often exceeded in the case of children for lead and arsenic. Regarding the hazard index (HI = ∑HQ), considering the bioaccessible, all except one of the samples present a non-carcinogenic risk for children. Carcinogenic risk for As have also been highlighted.

Ajmone-Marsana a Dipartimento di Scienze Agrarie, Forestali e Aòimentari, Università degli Studi di Torino, Italy elio.padoan@unito.it Zinc and cadmium are two of the most common heavy metals found at contaminated sites, with the main sources being anthropogenic activities as mining and smelting operations. When a highly contaminated soil becomes flooded, a number of chemical reactions may occur and define if the metals will be retained or released. The aims of this study was to evaluate the potential release and discuss the mechanisms that regulate Zn and Cd solubility in two mining soils under flooding conditions, using chemical extractions, mesocosm experiments and simple geochemical modelling. Mine-affected soil samples were collected in the mining basin of Gorno (Lombardia Region, northern Italy). Zinc-lead sulphides deposits have been mined in this area since Roman times and, at intervals, until now. Following a previous characterization study, we collected two representative soil samples contaminated by Zn (65 - 112 g/kg), Cd (160 - 360 mg/kg), Cu and Pb. In particular, Zn and Cd levels were several times higher than the limits established by Italian legislation. The waterlogging of the soils resulted in two somehow different behaviours regarding the metal contents in pore water. In Soil 1, Mn levels in the soil solution increased gradually while in Soil 2 the Mn reduction started immediately after flooding. In this second case, Fe was also slowly reduced and solubilized after the 5th week of the experiment. Total contents of Zn in both soils increased slightlyin the first week of flooding, decreasing almost linearly after the second week until the end of the experiment. In the case of Cd, the two soils behaved differently. In Soil 1, the soluble concentration decreased gradually over time while in Soil 2 a small peak of release appeared during the first days of the experiment followed by a sharp decrease until zero concentration after 28 days of experiment. The geochemical modelling predicted both metals precipitating in Soil 1 as Zn and Cd carbonate and no sulphide precipitation was calculated due to the relatively high Eh in the soil solution. Clays and Fe oxides seem not to have a great influence on the concentrations in the soil solution as both metals are preferentially complexed by SOM. In Soil 2, metals precipitate as Zn and Cd carbonate during the first days while sulphides are formed after 60 days of submersion. In this case, Fe oxides seem to adsorb slightly Zn but not Cd while both metals are preferentially complexed by SOM.

For example: any exposure to Pb is considered to be potentially harmful to human health; no threshold for adverse effects has been identified. However, only a fraction of heavy metals contaminated sites are treated today due to the lack of efficient and environmentally sustainable technologies. We recently developed unique soil washing technology - ReSoil, which efficiently removes heavy metals from soil by complexation with any of strong (biodegradable and environmental persistent) amino-polycarboxylic chelators, for example EDTA. The patented technology features a novel reaction of alkaline substitution, precipitation and adsorption of toxic metals on polysaccharides, and chelator acidic precipitation for process waters and chelator recycling in a closed loop. No wastewaters and max. 1% of solid wastes are generated (US Patent 9108233 B2; US Patent 10124378 B2). The post-remedial toxic emissions from soil are mitigated to the levels close or bellow limits of quantification by thorough soil rinsing and addition of zero-valent Fe (ZVI) into the soil slurry (GB Patent Appl. 1720126.0) which enables for fast and permanent adsorption of small residual quantities of chelator and toxic metals chelates. The process is abiotic; for example the poor EDTA biodegradability is not an issue even if exceedingly high concentration of this extremely efficient chelator is used in soil washing. Furthermore, ZVI slurry addition simultaneously immobilize oxy-anion forming contaminants such as As. ReSoil technology is cost-efficient (140-190 $ / ton without profit, economy of scale) due to the reagent recycling and using inexpensive / waste auxiliary materials (lime, sulphuric acid, waste paper, scrap iron) and common process machinery. Realistically tended vegetable gardens with EDTA-remediated soil (chelator was selected as the most efficient) have supported the growth of vegetables, grasses and horticultural plants. No significant leaching of toxic chelates from remediated soil was measured in beds constructed as lysimeters. The uptake of contaminating Pb, Zn and Cd into the edible parts of vegetables was greatly reduced bellow values stipulated by legislature for safe food. Remediation with high EDTA doses initially to some extend affected the soil C and N cycles, soil enzyme activities and the structure and abundance of soil microbial populations, especially arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM). However, using simple and inexpensive revitalisation measures, e.g., addition of compost, healthy un-polluted soil and commercial or indigenous microbial AM inoculum, completely restored microbial life. ReSoil technology is evaluated in recently constructed demonstrational remediation plant with capacity of up to 6 ton of soil per day (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r50LNFog-Hc&feature=youtu.be) and demonstrational gardens with remediated soil which are open for local community and other public.

Although the efficacy of Pb immobilization using phosphates has been demonstrated via the ingestion pathway (e.g. by promoting the formation of insoluble Pb-phosphates in the soil), its efficacy in reducing Pb exposure via the inhalation pathway has received little attention. This is particularly relevant because 90% of the inhaled dust may be swallowed within 24 h and reach the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract where the Pb may be subjected to the same conditions as ingested soil. This study compared Pb immobilisation efficacies of phosphorus (P) and iron (Fe) amendments via ingestion and inhalation pathways using in-vitro and in-vivo assays in conjunction with Pb speciation and dynamics via X-ray based spectroscopic methodologies.

Zhang, Y. Yin, W. Du and H. Guo State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, School of Environment, Nanjing University, China wgb0208@163.com Because of rapid industrialization and urbanization in China, large quantities of heavy metals have been discharged into the environment and caused serous soil pollution. Among the contaminants, cadmium (Cd) ranks the first in soil samples (7%) exceeding the limit. The availability of heavy metals, rather than the total concentration, posed environmental and human risks. Thus, this provide a strategy to remediation of heavy metals contaminated soils by immobilization, which transforms heavy metals into less bioavailable. In-situ immobilization is an inexpensive and effective solution for the remediation of extensively heavy metals contaminated soils. The immobilized metals may be released under different environmental stresses. However, most studies have focused on the influence of amendments on heavy metals availability and uptake by plants in a very short time. Therefore, it is essential to evaluation the sustainability of amendments under field conditions. In weak acid and Cd polluted soil (pH: 5.05, Cd: 0.56mg/kg), Jiangsu province, six alkaline materials were chosen as amendments and added to the soil in Through 10 years of continuous observation, the effectiveness of some materials was still considerable. The soil pH and CEC were remarkably increased by amendments at 1% dose. In contrast, the acid extractable Cd was significantly reduced. The Cd concentrations in Artemisia selengensis were compared in first, fifth and tenth year after amendment. The results showed that concentrations of Cd in A. selengensis were decreased with the increase of amount of amendments. The correlation analyses showed that the Cd concentrations in A. selengensis were significant negative with pH, CEC and bio-availability of Cd. It was noting that the Cd concentrations in A. selengensis were lower than limition at 1% addition (China Food Safety National Standard for Maximum Levels of Contaminants in Foods, GB 2762-2017), even ten years after amendment. Furthermore, no significant effects were found on biomass and the uptake of plant nutrition elements (K, Na, P, Ca, Mg). The selected materials combined with biochar were also used to remediate Cd polluted paddy soils in south China, Hunan (pH: 6.50, Cd: 0.45mg/kg) and Anhui (pH: 5.78, Cd: 2.3mg/kg). The results showed that composite passivators obviously reduced the bio-availability of Cd by increasing soil pH, CEC and OM, thereby decreased the uptake of Cd by rice. The Cd concentration in grains was reduced by more than 60% by the passivators and reached the limition. To our knowledge, this study was the longest evaluation of the effects of soil immobilization so far. The findings could be effectively and economically used for in situ remediation of heavy metals contaminated soils at a large scale.

Regional researches on the long-term monitoring of heavy metals in a soil-rice grain system, changed with environmental policy adjustment, have been hindered by limited detailed data. In this study, we collected 169 paired paddy rice grain and corresponding soil samples from a former intensive electronic-waste dismantling region to survey the current status of heavy metal contamination, and to reveal the temporal trends over the past decade based on the previous data obtained in 2006 and 2011. Moderate contaminations of Cd, Cu, Zn and Ni were observed in soil currently. Furthermore, 20.7% of rice grain samples exceeded the Cd threshold value. Cd, Cu, Zn and Pb shared the similar spatial distribution pattern with higher concentrations in northwest, which were contrary to Cr, Ni and As. Risk assessment indicated that much attention is required for the carcinogenic risk of Cr, Cd and As and non-carcinogen risk of Cr. Combining the spatial distribution of heavy metals in soil and rice grains, and the potential ecological risks, with the human health risks, the middle-west rice paddies were identified and proposed as priority areas. Percentage of soil Pb, Cd and Zn decreased in most area and slightly increased in northwest and east. Cu decreased in southwest and increased in central part, while Ni slightly increased in the whole region between 2006 and 2016. With the scrutiny of strict environmental policy, Cd still remained relatively constant levels in soil and rice grains during the last decade, which confirmed that the heavy metals were persisted over the long duration.

The remediation of polluted sites received increasing attention over the last decades. Today, dig and dump approaches cannot live up to the increasing need for sustainable solutions; so different in- and ex-situ remediation technologies have been intensively investigated, also in combination with complimentary soil amendments. In this context, soil washing techniques comprise an enormous potential for the efficient and sustainable remediation of trace metal (TM) contaminated soils. In pot experiments and an outdoor raised-bed setup, we investigate the effect of a new ex-situ washing technique using Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) which efficiently extracts TMs (Zn, Cd, Pb) from a contaminated Cambisol located at a former lead mining and smelting region in Austria. Our research goal is the reduction of TM toxicity in these soils while restoring the losses in soil functionality by the application of organic and inorganic amendments. Our results show that compared to the untreated soil, the washing procedure successfully reduced the total content of the main contaminants Pb, Cd and Cd by 80 %, 40 % and 70 %, resulting in a significantly lower concentration of Cd and Zn in the aerial tissue of radish (Raphanus sativus L.) cultivated in these soils. The significant increase in biomass production, observed in the EDTA-washed treatments, could have been caused by reduced toxicity levels. The Pb concentrations on the other hand, tended to increase in the plants after the washing with EDTA. Despite extensive soil rinsing after the washing procedure, these findings suggest the presence of mobile metal chelate residuals. To counter this effect, the application of Fe0 was investigated for its ability to adsorb and immobilize EDTA, eventually reducing Pb in vegetable plants to concentrations below food security levels. Water extractable ETDA-TM complexes will be measured spectrophotometrically after induced ferroin formation in the extract. In parallel, the application of organic amendments (vermicompost and biochar) after the washing procedure is studied to analyze the potential for the restoration of plant nutrient availability, water holding capacity and the microbial community. The water retention curves of different amendment mixtures and soil microbial phospholipid fatty acids will be determined with respect to the efficiency of the treatments in revitalizing the washed soils.

Human exposure to low levels of Cd can result in kidney damage as well as lung, bone, cardiovascular system, liver and reproductive system damage. The Cd-contaminated soils have become more prevalent than before, largely due to contamination from metallurgical factories, waste disposal, heating processes and agricultural applications. Whereas, phytoremediation has been proved to be a potential cost-effective solution for the remediation of contaminated soils. According to previous studies, willow has a high efficacy of accumulation of Cd in hydroponics conditions and could represent a prospective tree for remediating polluted soils. Evidence exists that Cd and certain nutrient elements, such as Fe and Mg, could share similar mechanisms of plant uptake and accumulation. Previous paper show that Mg and Fe deficiency in mature plants of willow (Salix Viminalis), grown in hydroponic solutions containing 5 μg ml-1 of Cd, caused a significant increase in Cd accumulation in roots, stems and leaves. Although Cd uptake was mostly confined in roots, high Cd content in aerial plant parts indicates that the analysed Salix viminalis genotype is suitable for phytoextraction. Besides, many soil bacteria are tolerant to heavy metals and play important roles in mobilization of heavy metals. Thus, comparing with phytoremediation, plants and microbe is emerging as a fast, more efficient and reliable approach for the estimation of the bioaccessibility of heavy metals in soils. Here we report that the benefits of combining siderophore-producing bacteria (SPB) with plants for metal removal. Metal-resistant SPB play an important role in the successful survival and growth of plants in contaminated soils by alleviating the metal toxicity and supplying the plant with nutrients, particularly iron. Furthermore, bacterial siderophores are able to bind metals other than iron and thus enhance their bioavailability in the rhizosphere of plants. finally, an increase in plant growth and metal uptake will further enhance the effectiveness of phytoremediation processes. Therefore, isolating corresponding bacteria is a of key importance for making decisions concerning soil remediation. Currently, there were some SPB were isolated by chrome azurol S (CAS) soild medium from Cd-contaminated soils sampled from Huize County in China. The maximium siderophore concentration of them is Y12-D-1 bacteria, reaching up to 90.6 mM DFOB (equiv.). This corresponds to tens of micromoles to a few millimoles per liter if a relative molecular mass of 1000 is assumed for siderophores. Then the siderophore produced by Y12-D-1 will be used in hydroponic experiment to examine the ability of it in improving Cd bioavailability and enhancing willow growth.

Ferrihydrite is metastable and can transform into crystalline minerals with time, and this process could reduce the specific surface area, surface sites and change the adsorption properties (such as capacity, affinity) of arsenic. Previous studies have focused on the adsorption capacity of As(V) in ferrihydrite or crystalline iron (hydr)oxides (goethite, hematite and magnetite, etc.), however, the understanding of adsorption capacity of the different mass fractions and crystallinity iron (hydr)oxides produced by the ferrihydrite during the conversion process, the strong adsorption capacity of the crystalline iron oxides for arsenic, and the long-term stability of the formed iron-arsenic complexes is still lack. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of arsenic concentrations on the transformation of ferrihydrite; the adsorption characteristics of different crystalline iron oxides on arsenic during the aging of ferrihydrite; and the stability of As(V)-Fe complexes at 75 °C. The time of adding arsenate was determined according to the conversion process of ferrihydrite, and the stability of As(V)-Fe complexes in different aging stages was investigated by wet chemistry experiments and spectroscopic analysis. Results as follows: (1) Arsenic reduced the transformation rate of ferrihydrite, and the inhibition intensity increased with arsenic concentration. High (Fe/As=1.875) and low (Fe/As=5.66) concentration of arsenate were added at different ferrihydrite aging period. The content of soluble Fe3+ remained basically stability in the high arsenic system but increased with culture time in low arsenic system, suggesting that the conversion and dissolution rate of ferrihydrite were affected by the arsenic concentration. (2) With ferrihydrite aging time, the release rate of arsenic was decreased and the stability of iron-arsenic complexes was increased, which affected by arsenic concentration. High-concentration and low-concentration arsenate were added at 0 d, initial stage (1d and 4d), middle stage (10d) and later stage (30d) of ferrihydrite aging, respectively. At 0 day of ferrihydrite aging, soluble As(V) contents began to increase after 1 day and 4 days mixing with high and low arsenate; at the initial stage, soluble As(V) contents of two treatment both began to increase after 8 day mixing; at the middle and later stages, soluble As(V) contents of two treatment both began to increase after 30 day mixing. (3) In the process of iron (hydr)oxide adsorbed arsenic, the stability of iron-arsenic complexes was affected by the crystallinity and surface characteristics of ferrihydrite and the competition between iron and arsenic for Fe3 cluster sites. (4) XRD, FTIR and XPS analysis showed that partial arsenic gradually transferred from the surface of iron (hydr)oxide into lattice with the ferrihydrite aging and the arsenic adsorption time. Moreover, although ferrihydrite has a strong adsorption capacity for arsenic, the As(V)-Fe complexes is unstable and easily affected by the transformation of ferrihydrite.

Environmental selection of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is considered to be due to antibiotic residues or metal residues, both lavishly used in livestock. In this study we targeted three poultry farms to compare the co-occurrence patterns of antibiotics and metals residues in relation to ARGs. We quantified 296 ARGs using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HT-qPCR) based ARG chip, with an abundance range of 6.67x10-7 - 9.55x10-01 copy of ARG per copy of 16S-rRNA gene. More abundant ARGs belong to aminoglycosides, MLSB, tetracycline, fosfomycin and sulfonamides. LC-MS/MS was used for quantification of 49 antibiotic residues and ICPMS for heavy metals quantification. These resistance genes likely colocalize in microbial genomes in the farms. Selection of these resistance cluster is likely due to application of wide range of chemicals in many forms to the poultry birds which confer resistance and disseminate to the environment. A significant co-occurrence pattern was explored using network analysis between provided heavy metals and ARGs. Antibiotics and heavy metals used in feed supplements were high elevated in manure that suggests the potential for coselection of resistance traits. Mental test and Procrustes analysis showed significant correlation between ARGs profile and bacterial community. In conclusion, these results indicate the role of heavy metals in feed in co-selection of ARGs and MGEs in poultry farm environment and suggest a risk for environmental ARGs dissemination via horizontal gene transfer.

The accumulation of heavy metals in soils was affected by soil pH and soil organic matter. The calculated hazard quotients (HQ) of the heavy metals by vegetable consumption decreased in the order of leafy > rootstalk > fruit vegetables.

ReSoil uses alkaline conditions (lime, waste polysaccharide material) to recycle chelator in washing solution and acidic conditions (H2SO4) to precipitate chelator from diluted soil-rinsing solutions. Very small quantities of chelator, which remain in remediated soil are permanently absorbed on zero-valent Fe (added into soil slurry) to curb any potential emissions of toxic chelates. Acidic and calcareous soils historically polluted with Pb (main contaminant), Zn and Cd were used to represent two different soil types. Tests was performed in a pilot-scale ReSoil remediation facility (soil batches 10-100 kg, solid: liquid ratio 1:1). Initial results indicate that GLDA removes toxic metals almost as efficiently as EDTA: up to 60 and 70% of Pb was removed from calcareous and acid soil, respectively. GLDA is soluble under wide pH range and was not precipitated in acidic phase of ReSoil process. Close to complete chelator removal is essential for close-loop reuse of process waters and to prevent generation of waste-waters. Biodegradation of GLDA in process solutions or spry drying are presumable solutions, but could prove time-consuming and expensive. GLDA was also much more aggressive for soil organic matter (SOM) compared to EDTA, causing extensive depolymerisation and SOM lost. IDS exhibited less than 50% efficiency of toxic metal removal compared to EDTA. IDS was, however, easily recycled in ReSoil process. The process parameters (material balance, cost, potential toxic emissions from remediated soil), soil remediation efficiency (total toxic metal removal, metal bioavailability reduction, uptake into buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum) as a test plant), biological soil properties (dehydrogenase, urease and β-glucosidase activity) and pedological soil properties (SOM, available P and K, pH, KIK) of soils remediated using biodegradable GLDA and IDS and benchmark EDTA chelator will be reported.

Kaurina, T. Grubarb, H. Prosenb and D. Lestana a Biotechnical faculty , University of Ljubljana, Slovenia b Faculty of Chemistry and Chemical Technology, University of Ljubljana, Slovenia simon.gluhar@bf.uni-lj.si Soil washing with chelating agents was proposed for the removal of heavy metals from contaminated soils decades ago. Recently introduced ReSoil technology recycles EDTA and process waters in a closed-loop process using inexpensive and waste materials. No waste water is generated from the novel soil remediation process. Furthermore, extensive soil rinsing combined with the amendment of zero-valent Fe into the soil slurry was shown to facilitate permanent adsorption of the remaining small quantity of EDTA chelates. As a result, emissions from remediated soil are curbed and the soil does not contain available EDTA. Any harmful remediation effects on soil properties are thus restricted to process conditions and exposure to EDTA during the washing process and they later disappear. Indeed, the novel remediation method preserves the soil as a plant substrate for the production of safe vegetables and does not significantly affect the soil microbial structure and abundance, soil enzyme activity and C and N cycles. Nonetheless, the lay public and decision makers prefer so-called »green« solutions and are often suspicious of chemical interventions. Using natural, biological means to fix man-inflicted environmental damage is indeed appealing but it is not always feasible for solving difficult problems. It is therefore essential for the adoption of novel soil washing technology to research into wide aspects of the safety and suitability of the technology. For example, the ability of soil to mitigate the unwanted effects of pesticide usage is at the base of modern agricultural food production, as one of the most vital soil ecosystem services. It also safeguards our drinking groundwater. The aim of the study was therefore to investigate the persistence of S-metalachlor, bentazon, isoproturon and mecaprop-P in freshly EDTA-remediated Pb contaminated acidic and calcareous farmland soil. These four herbicides were selected since they are the major contaminants of groundwater and surface freshwater in Europe. ReSoil technology removed 79 and 73% of Pb from acidic and calcareous soil with 740 and 2179 mg kg-1 Pb, respectively. The dissipation kinetics of four herbicides was investigated under field conditions in beds with maize (Zea mays) and barley (Hordeum vulgare). The biphasic First-Order Multi-Compartment (FOMC) model was used to fit experimental data and calculate the herbicides’ half-life (DT50) in soil. Remediation significantly (up to 64%) decreased initial dehydrogenase activity assessed as a marker of soil microbial activity and prolonged the DT50 of herbicides in acidic soils from 16% (isoproturon) to 111% (S-metachlor). Remediation had a less significant effect on herbicide dissipation in calcareous soils; i.e., mecoprop-P DT50 increased by 3%, while isoproturon and S-metachlor DT50 decreased by 29%. Overall, the dissipation from remediated soils was faster than the average DT50 of tested herbicides published in the Pesticides Properties DataBase. Results demonstrate that EDTA-based remediation of the studied soils does not pose any threat of extended herbicide persistence.

The pollution especially in soils seriously affect the ecosystem due to its low transference, permanent residence and invulnerable to microbial degradation in soils. For human, heavy metals are introduced to the body mostly by inhalation or resorption. Mushrooms are efficient heavy metal accumulators. Thus it is necessary to investigate their pollution level thus to accurately assess their risk for human health. The aims of the study were to: (1) investigate heavy metals (As, Pb, Cd and Hg) levels in soils and the growing wild edible mushrooms; (2) establish correlations between soil and mushroom heavy metal contents to estimate soil-to-plant bioavailability; and (3) evaluate the health risk of wild edible mushrooms of different ages basing on a probabilistic method. There are 63 mushroom samples from 11 species. The samples were washed with tap water and distilled water, using porcelain stainless steel scissors to separate it into caps and stipes and freezed dried at –65°C (Freez Zone 12, LABCONCO) until to get constant mass. After recording dry weights, the lyophilized samples were cut and ground with mortar and pestle under liquid N2 protection to obtain homogeneous materials and stored at −20°C for further analysis. Samples were pass through a 100-mesh sieve and heavy metals were analyzed with X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF). Standard soil (GBW07401), plant (GBW10048) and Hunan rice (GBW10045) reference materials were used for quality control. Mathematical methods and in vitro simulation experiments were conducted to evaluate the human health risk of typical mushrooms. Information obtained from this study helps to examine the plant bioavailability of soil heavy metals and develop strategies to reduce heavy metals plant uptake for improving food safety.

In the present study, a batch experiment was set up with As and Tl contaminated soil in combination with two amendments (Fe-Mn binary oxides and Titanate nanomaterials), to evaluate the effects of the treatment on the mobility and bioavailability of Tl and As. The results of toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) indicated that the Fe-Mn binary oxides exhibited the highest stabilization level for the exchangeable fraction of Tl and As (Tl=49.61% and As=53.01%). Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra of Fe–Mn binary oxides suggested that it combined the oxidation property of manganese dioxide and the high adsorption features to As(V) of iron oxides, surface complexation, oxidation and precipitation were the main mechanisms for the stabilization of Tl, as for As, the main mechanisms were complexation and oxidation. After 7 days treatment of TNMs, more than 90% of exchangeable Tl was stabilized at TNMs dose of 3% (by dry weight), but it had no effect on As. Excellent Tl stabilization mainly depended on complexation of –ONa functional groups in the interlayers and Ti–OH on the surfaces of TNMs as well as ion exchange with Na+/H+. This study provides alternative potential in situ remediation strateies for both Tl and As stabilization in contaminated soils.

In the present study, we have investigated the influence of aluminum on the sorption properties of ferrihydrite with respect to environmentally relevant aqueous arsenic species, arsenite and arsenate. We have conducted sorption experiments by reacting aqueous As(III) and As(V) with synthetic Al-free and Al-bearing ferrihydrite at pH 6.5. Our results reveal that, when increasing the Al:Fe molar ratio in Fh, the sorption density dramatically decreased for As(III), whereas it increased for As(V). Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy analysis at the As K-edge indicated that the AsIIIO3 pyramid binds to FeO6 octahedra on both Al-free Fh and Al-bearing Fh, by forming bidentate mononuclear edge-sharing (2E) and bidentate binuclear corner- sharing (2C) surface complexes characterized by As_Fe distances of 2.9 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively. The decrease in As(III) sorption density with increasing Al:Fe ratio in Fh could thus be explained by a low affinity of the As(OH)3 molecule for Al surface sites compared to Fe ones. In contrast, on the basis of available literature on As(V) adsorption mechanisms, we suggest that, in addition to inner-sphere 2C arsenate surface complexes, outer-sphere arsenate surface complexes forming hydrogen bonds with both [AlـOH] and [FeـOH] surface sites could explain the enhancement of As(V) sorption onto aluminous Fh relative to Al-free Fh, as observed in the present study. The presence of aluminum in Fh may thus enhance the mobility of arsenite with respect to arsenate in Acid Mine Drainage impacted systems, while mixed Al:Fe systems could present an alternative for arsenic removal from impacted waters, provided that As(III) would be oxidized to As(V).

In order to prove up the accumulation characteristics of heavy metals in the agricultural lands on the periphery of Ningbo city in eastern Zhejiang Province and the potential ecological hazard risk, topsoil samples in the survey region were systematically collected so as to determine the content of heavy metal elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, Zn) and reference elements (Li, Eu, Sc, Sm). Through the analysis of elemental correlation, appropriate standard factors were screened out, and then, according to the standardized method, the environmental geochemical baselines of the heavy metals As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb and Zn in the survey region were established, so the baselines were obtained, respectively, 6.93, 0.23, 77.22, 49.14, 0.80, 30.24, 58.40 and 125.80 mg·kg-1. Taking the environmental geochemical baselines as standard factors, the enrichment factor method was used to identify the geological background sources of heavy metals in the soils and the superposition of man-made pollution. As a result, the risk evaluation and space early warning research of potential ecological and environmental hazards of heavy metals in the agricultural lands of the survey region were carried out. The research results showed, heavy metal enrichment in the topsoils of the survey region was mainly influenced by the activities of industrial enterprises and the concentration center was densely distributed in the surrounding areas of printing and dyeing companies, which had the tendency of migration to the low-lying plains along water networks; Cd and Hg had potentially high ecological risk in the survey region; GIS system was used to achieve the spatial overlay of the enrichment factors in each sampling points, potential ecological hazard evaluation results as well as agricultural land use status map of the survey region, which realized the discrimination of the superposition of man-made heavy metal pollution and the space early warning of potential ecological hazard risk from the perspective of geographical space.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the long-term and short-term effects of heavy metals on microbial biomass and the microbial community in soils of similar physicochemical properties. Our aims were to simultaneously compare the effects of Cd, Cu, Zn and their combined action on microbial biomass and bacterial community structure, both in a long term Chinese field trials and short-term laboratory experiments on the same soils. Our hypothesis was that there are comparable relationships between the effects of heavy metals measured in the environment and in the laboratory, so that laboratory results can be used as valid predictors of the environmental effects of heavy metals in soil. Despite the low Cd concentrations in the field soil (maximum metal concentrations 300 Zn, 500 Cu, 1.5 mg Cd kg-1 soil), Cd apparently produced the most significant negative correlation with biomass C. However, in the laboratory experiment (250, 400 and 1.5 mg kg-1) there were no decreases in biomass C or ATP, or changes in microbial community structure at lower metal concentrations and only at the high Cd +Zn and Cd + Zn + Cu concentrations. At the heavy metal concentrations applied in the laboratory experiment, the effects of Cu on the microbial biomass and bacterial community were greater than Cd and Zn. Although Cd had no significant effect on the microbial biomass below 1.5 mg kg-1, the synergistic effect between Cd and Cu made a significant difference to the bacterial community. There was also a competitive relationship between Cd and Zn. Therefore, should heavy metal standards be applied in the future based on their effects on soil microbes, these results suggest that it is important that the combined toxicity of heavy metals should be considered, rather than the activities of individual metals. Based on this study, we also conclude that there is little or no relationship between field and comparable laboratory experiments on the effects of heavy metals on microbial processes. Also, determining the effects of individual heavy metals on the microbial community under field conditions is likely to give false conclusions when other metals are also present.

Up to now, there are many techniques which have been applied to remove metal ions from waste water, among which adsorption exhibits a particularly competitive and effective advantage for heavy metal’s removal. Diatomite is a kind of biogenic siliceous rock which was formed by the initial diagenesis and preliminary diagenesis of diatom. Because of small bulk density, large specific surface area, large quantity of micropores and its well-developed pore structure which bears a large number of active groups and a certain negative charge, diatomite exhibits the potential material for adsorption of heavy metals.

In view of this, the adsorption conditions, properties, behavior and characteristics of Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ on diatomite surface were systematically studied throuhg static adsorption test. The characteristic results illustrate that adsorption density of Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ on natural diatomite increase first and then decrease with increasing diatomite adding quantity and ion initial concentration, increase constantly with solution initial pH, and the effect of solution temperature on ion adsorption process is not obvious. The most suitable isotherm models for describing adsorption of Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ onto natural diatomite are Langmuir, Tenkin and Freundlich; the adsorption of each ion onto natural diatomite is mainly a physical process; the adsorption reaction is easy to happen, and the control step of adsorption process is adsorption reaction happened in microporous. It can also be found that, the adsorption of Cu2+, Zn2+, Mn2+ onto natural diatomite can reach equilibrium in forty minutes, the adsorption kinetics fit well with the pseudo-second-order model, and the adsorption is spontaneous, endothermic and disorder enhancing.

This element can exist in the soil in different oxidation states (-III, 0, III or V) and forms (inorganic or organic). Prevailing in the environment and the most lethal are inorganic forms of As (arsenate (AsV) and arsenite (AsIII)). Arsenic as a non-essential element damages the plants at various physiological and biochemical levels. Probably the most dangerous aspect of its acting in the plant body at the subcellular level is the production of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) like superoxide radical, hydroxyl radical and hydrogen peroxide. To protect themselves, the plants dispose of antioxidant systems including antioxidant enzymes (peroxidases, superoxide dismutase, catalase) or they accumulate a non-enzymatic protectant – proline. These biochemical barriers are a part of the plant immune system which includes also producing mechanical barriers. The main objective of the present study was to elucidate the role of peroxidases in the model plant tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) facing arsenate (Na2HAsO4.7H2O) toxicity in the controlled in vitro conditions. The seeds were surface sterilised and sown on the modified MS cultivation medium as a control treatment or As treatments (several concentrations were tested). Peroxidases as multifunctional enzymes are involved in a wide range of physiological processes. They are not only a part of an antioxidant defence but are also important players in the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways allowing e. g. lignin to be synthetized. For that, the roles of peroxidases (POX) in different plant parts were assessed in the present study histochemically in situ, by measuring the specific activities of POX and at the molecular level using a real-time PCR.

Birnessites possess an external and an interlayer surface that are both available for ion adsorption. However, the level of quantitative understanding of metal ion adsorption to birnessite as a function of the environmental conditions is still much smaller than that of metal ion binding to iron and aluminum (hydr)oxides. The main reason for this is that for the latter (hydr)oxides the multi-site surface complexation model including charge distribution (CD-MUSIC) developed by Hiemstra et al. has been worked out in combination with a Stern-Gouy-Chapman (SGC) model of an electrical double layer (EDL), whereas for birnessites only rather simple and not very realistic surface complexation models have been used. In addition, heavy metal adsorption onto birnessite was found to depend on the birnessite microstructure, including the absolute numbers of vacant sites, edge sites and the amount of Mn(III) in the interlayer and in the layer for birnessites with a different Mn average oxidation state (MnAOS). However, some controversy exists on contribution of vacant and edge sites to the total heavy metal adsorption. Therefore, using X-ray diffraction with Rietveld refinement to obtain the reactive sites and their densities, a CD-MUSIC model combined with a Stern-Gouy-Chapman electrical double layer (EDL) model for the external surface and a Donnan model for the interlayer surface is developed for birnessites with different Mn average oxidation state (MnAOS). Proton affinity constants and the charge distributions of Pb surface complexes were calculated a priory. By fitting Pb adsorption data to the model the obtained equilibrium constants (logKPb) of Pb complexes were 6.9-10.9 for the double-corner-sharing and double-edge-sharing Pb2+ complexes on the edge sites and 2.2-6.5 for the triple-corner-sharing Pb2+ complex on the vacancies. The larger logKPb value was obtained for higher MnAOS. Speciation calculations showed that with increasing MnAOS from 3.67 to 3.92 the interlayer surface contribution to the total Pb2+ adsorption increased from 43.2% to 48.6%, and the vacancy contribution increased from 43.9% to 54.7%. The vacancy contribution from interlayer surface was predominant.

Insufficient information has achieved on the in-situ pore-scale lead immobilization processes. In this work, we carried out visualized Pb immobilization by 0.5 mol/L monopotassium phosphate in 1D counter-diffusion U-tube, which composed of equivalent amount of crystallized lead carbonate in the 0.2wt% porous agarose hydrogel. Migration of the adding P was solely controlled by counter-diffusion. As illustrated by optical microscopy and SEM images, lead carbonate of homogenous hexagonal rod-like crystals gradually developed significant reaction front and zonation in different horizontal locations, and transformed crystals into scattered elongate large-size platy morphology in the cationic side and dense small needle-clusters in the anionic side until a balance had reached after more than 3 weeks. Occasionally, there were horizontally distributed filamentous or chain-linking crystals, which may be the accretion pathway of tiny crystal particles. Results also revealed that the original surface of protogenetic minerals were etched by the secondary minerals, making the surface with arranged mosaic pattern. Crystal surface become less smooth as the agarose pore size get larger, and debris of unassembled sediments formed when adding humic acid, implying the flexible crystal growth mode with various conditions, thus challenged the mineral stability. Finally, some unconverted lead carbonate minerals had been found in the unreachable middle of the tube due to the compact crystal density, responsible for the potential release risk once the sediments get crack. The above results revealed the in-situ mineral phase transformation during the immobilization processes, providing better understand and feasible improvement approaches of the lead immobilization effectiveness.

China b Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences/University of Waterloo, Canada pengliu@cug.edu.cn Elevated concentrations of Hg in a range of environmental compartments (e.g., rivers, sediment, lakes, and oceans) are a world-wide concern, especially for sediment that is a sink for Hg accumulation. Different remediation methods have been evaluated for mercury removal or stabilization. These methods include sediment dredging, amendment using activated carbon or biochar, etc. However, most of the remediation methods are expensive and the long-term fate of Hg has not been well investigated. Here we investigated the effectiveness of activated carbon and four types of biochar, including (switchgrass (300°C and 600°C), poultry manure (600°C), and oak (~700°C)) to stabilize Hg in contaminated sediment under anaerobic conditions for 1030 days. The feed stocks of these biochars are widely available and can be used for biochar production at low cost. The results indicate aqueous concentrations of total Hg and methylmercury generally decreased in the presence of biochars, with the exception of a spike in methylmercury concentration observed at ~440 days in the switchgrass at 600°C and oak biochar systems. The change of total Hg and methylmercury in sediment controls and amended systems corresponded to the observation of potential mercury methylators and change of carbon sources for the microbes, and total Fe and sulfate concentrations in solution. Identification of the mechanisms controlling Hg uptake by these biochar particles was determined using X-ray fluorescence imaging (XRFI) and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) techniques, including micro-X-ray fluorescence (micro-XRF) mapping, confocal micro-X-ray fluorescence imaging (CMXRFI), Hg extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), and S X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES). Micro-XRF maps and CMXRFI show that Hg co-exists with S, Cu, Fe, Mn, and Zn on the surface and inside the biochar particles. EXAFS modeling shows that Hg is in an oxide form on the surface of an iron (hydro)oxide particle from fresh sediment and in Hg-sulfide forms in biochar samples. S XANES analyses show that sulfide is present within the biochar particles. After amendment with biochars, a fraction of the Hg originally present in unstable forms (dissolvable, HgO, colloidal, nano, etc.) in the sediment was likely stabilized as less soluble Hg-sulfide phases on the surface or within the biochar particles. Based on the aqueous and solid phase analysis, three primary geochemical stages were assigned to the microcosm experiment, including nitrate reduction, overlapped iron and sulfate reduction, and methanogenic stages. Methylmercury was primarily generated during the overlapped iron and sulfate reduction stages. Total Hg was under control after the overlapped iron and sulfate reduction stage. The Hg that accumulated in the biochar through this process is expected to remain stable for a prolonged period. Further, this process may also be extended to the accumulation of other hazardous metal elements.

The high toxicity of arsenic derivatives converts this element in a serious problem of public health worldwide. There is a global arsenic geocycle in which microbes play a relevant role. Ancient exposure to arsenic derivatives, both inorganic and organic, has represented a selective pressure for microbes to evolve or acquire diverse arsenic resistance genetic systems. In addition, arsenic compounds appear to have been used as a toxin in chemical warfare for a long time selecting for an extended selection of arsenic resistance determinants. Arsenic resistance strategies rely mainly on membrane transport pathways that extrude the toxic compounds from the cell cytoplasm. The ars operons, first discovered in bacterial R-factors almost 50 years ago, are the most common microbial arsenic resistance systems. Numerous ars operons, with a variety of genes and different combinations of them, populate the prokaryotic genomes, including their accesory plasmids, transposons and genomic islands. Besides these canonical, widespread ars gene clusters, which confer resistance to the inorganic forms of arsenic, additional genes have been discovered recently, which broadens the spectrum of arsenic tolerance by detoxifying organic arsenic derivatives ofen used as toxins.

Therefore, sustainable remedial approach and the study of contaminant geochemistry are topical areas of intense research. In this study, clay minerals, a constituent part of soil system has been evaluated as an underlying influence to soil cleaning. Multi-metal spiked simulated soil (SS), prepared according to standard guidelines, and varied for montmorillonite clay (MC) and kaolinite clay (KC) which, are commonly found in soils were utilized as a proxy to investigate the leaching behaviour of contaminated soils (SA and SB) of natural origin for cleaning protocols using different chelating agents (ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid [EDTA], ethylene diamine disuccinic acid [EDDS], acetylacetone [Hacac], and citric acid [CA]) on a dynamic system. Geochemical characteristics and metal quantification were conducted on the samples using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), Raman and inductive coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) respectively. Results showed that similar leaching trend were observed for both the simulated and natural soil systems regardless of the leaching treatment applied. As expected, higher leaching regime was observed for the simulated soil compared to the natural soils due to metal ageing. Geochemical analysis revealed a stronger influence of montmorillonite clay minerals on the sorption of targeted metals compared to the kaolinite clay. A more advanced soil washing protocol specifically engineered for a recalcitrant-clay soil system is essential to promote agricultural production, enhance food security and scale down land tenure problems in the 21st century.

Recent studies reported that the rare-earth element lanthanum has a strong binding ability towards phosphate ions, while the underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Herein, this work systematically investigated the mechanisms of phosphate removal using La(OH)3 by employing extended X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS), attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR), density functional theory (DFT) and chemical equilibrium modelling. The results showed that surface complexation was the primary mechanism for phosphate removal and in binary phosphate configurations, namely diprotonated bidentate mononuclear (BM-H2) and bidentate binuclear (BB-H2), coexisting on La(OH)3 in acidic conditions. By increasing the pH to 7, BM-H1 and BB-H2 were the two major configurations governing phosphate adsorption on La(OH)3, whereas BB-H1 was the dominant configuration of phosphate adsorption at pH 9. With increasing phosphate loading, the phosphate configuration of on La(OH)3 transforms from binary BM-H1 and BB-H2 to BB-H1. Amorphous Ca3(PO4)2 forms in the presence of Ca, leading to enhanced phosphate removal at alkaline conditions. The contributions of different mechanisms to the overall phosphate removal were successfully simulated by a chemical equilibrium model that was consistent with the spectroscopic results. Taking the great advantage of the strong complexation ability of La with P, novel magnetically recoverable magnetite/lanthanum hydroxide [M-La(OH)3] hybrids have been further developed. Results show that M-La(OH)3 exhibits a strong sorption towards phosphate with sorption capacities of up to 52.7 mg-P/g at pH 7.0 in water, and also demonstrate that sediment suspensions mixed with a M-La(OH)3 content of 1-3% exhibit a capability of up to 1.2 mg-P/g for sequestering external phosphate compared with that of 0.2 mg-P/g for pristine sediment at pH 7.3. M-La(OH)3-mixed sediment suspensions appear to effectively sequester phosphate over an environmentally relevant pH range from 4 to 8.5. These findings shed light on understanding the surface complexes of La with P at the molecular level, and guiding to develop new technologies for phosphate sequestration and recovery from lake.

Catalanoa, J.S. Yana, H. Chena and K. Wanga a Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Washington University, U.S.A. catalano@wustl.edu Iron oxide minerals are ubiquitous in nature and often have great influence on the fate and availability of trace elements. Zn is an essential trace element for biological processes, but can be toxic at higher concentration. Zn cycling and availability can be affected by its adsorption on, incorporation in, and release from iron oxides. Ferrihydrite is a metastable nanocrystalline iron oxide and transforms to more crystalline phases when exposed to dissolved Fe(II) under anoxic condition. While such reactions have been widely investigated, the effects of ferrihydrite phase transformations on solid-associated trace element speciation and how such elements impact the resulting mineral products are poorly studied. In addition, it is unknown whether Zn repartitioning during such transformations fractionates trace element stable isotopes. To better understand the behavior of Zn during Fe(II)-induced ferrihydrite transformation, we have investigated the phase transformations of Zn-substituted (2 mol%) ferrihydrite at pH 7 under different Fe(II) concentrations at reaction times up to 40 days. X-ray diffraction patterns of the reaction products reveal that low Fe(II) concentration (0.2 mM) favors the formation of hematite, lepidocrocite, and goethite; whereas high Fe(II) concentration (1 mM) promotes the production of magnetite, lepidocrocite, and goethite. Both transformations processes are associated with the transient release of Zn to solution, which during aging is taken up by the mineral products. Rietveld refinement of the XRD data shows a progressive transformation from ferrihydrite to other iron oxides, with new phase nucleating within a few days but changes continuing over the entire duration of study. Control experiments with Zn-free ferrihydrite observe no hematite formation, indicating that Zn alters ferrihydrite transformation pathways. EXAFS spectroscopy shows that the coordination of solid-associated Zn changed from tetrahedral to a mixture of tetrahedral and octahedral during the transformations. Despite these coordination changes, ferrihydrite transformations produce only a minor fractionation of Zn stable isotopes. This work shows that iron oxide mineralogical transformations occurring at redox interfaces may transiently solubilize trace elements such as zinc. Under conditions with substantial advective fluid flow, this may facilitate mobilization and transport. The minimal isotopic fraction observed suggest that such mobilization may not leave detectable signatures in the remaining iron oxides. More broadly, this study builds on a growing body of work demonstrating the unexpected mobility of iron oxide-associated trace elements under dynamic redox conditions, and raises questions about the long-term viability of coprecipitation as a method of contaminant remediation.

However, biogeochemical cycling of arsenic in those eutrophic waters and its impact on public health are still poorly understood. Here laboratory simulation experiments are performed to study the effect of algal blooms on the biogeochemical cycling of arsenic in a sediment–water–air system. We found that the anoxia induced by the degradation of algal biomass promoted an acute arsenic (mostly As(III)) release within two days from sediment to both the water and atmosphere, and the release effluxes were proportional to the algae dosage. The reduction and methylation of arsenic were enhanced at the sediment–water interface, owing to the significant increase in arsenate reductase genes (arrA and arsC), and arsenite methyltransferase genes (arsM) caused by the increased anoxia. The analysis of synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy indicated that the concomitantly released natural organic matter (NOM) and sulfur (S) at the sediment–water interface reduced the As(III) release to a certain extent in the later reducing period of the incubation experiment, by forming As2S3 (43–51%) and As(III)-Fe-NOM (28–35%).

Siderite (FeCO3), an Fe(II)-containing mineral which occurs in many anoxic soils, sediments and groundwater systems, can be extremely redox reactive, thus making it a potentially important phase governing the fate and transport of Cr(VI) in many subsurface environments. Here we investigate the sorption and reduction of Cr(VI) on siderite, as well as speciation of Cr(VI)-reacted siderite as a function of varying pH (4–10) and initial Cr(VI) concentrations (0.5–10 mM) under strictly O2-free experimental conditions. The maximum Cr(VI) removal capacity by siderite was 81 mg g-1 at pH 5, which decreased at higher pH values. Notably, up to 97% and 91% of total aqueous chromium, at all initial added aqueous Cr(VI) concentrations (0.5–10 mM), was sorbed/reduced to Cr(III) at pH 4 and 5, respectively, indicating a strong Cr(VI) reducing ability of siderite. At pH 6–10, over 90% of aqueous chromium was detected as Cr(III) only at initial Cr(VI) concentration ranging from 0.5–1.5 mM. Chromium K-edge X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy confirmed the complete reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) after equilibration of siderite with low and high initial Cr(VI) concentrations (2 and 10 mM, respectively) at pH 5, 7 and 9. In addition, Fe K-edge XANES and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra of solid-phase samples showed that 74–78% and 78–89% of Fe remained as siderite, respectively, after equilibration with Cr(VI) at pH 5, 7 and 9, whereas only 24% remained for the low Cr(VI) treatment at pH 5. Overall, this study suggests that under anoxic aqueous conditions, siderite can immobilize and detoxify Cr(VI), with the extent of these coupled sorption and redox reactions being controlled by initial Cr(VI) concentrations and pH.

BMN showed excellent As(III) removal performances such as high adsorption capacity (16.23 mg/g), collectability of magnetism, reusability and low cost. Importantly, when BMN was loaded in sponges with a microporous structure, the collectability of BMN in soil was improved. The system of BMN and sponges could efficiently remove As(III) from soil and the resulting BMN/sponge/As(III) could easily separate from soil using a magnet. In addition, when BMN was loaded on filter paper, the system of BMN and filter papers could be conveniently used as an excellent filter layer to control the migration of As(III) in soil. Pot incubations indicated that BMN could increase the pH value of soil and decreased the concentration of available arsenic in soil.

Organohalide-respiring bacteria such as Sulfurospirrilium multivorans (Smul) and Dehalococcoides mccartyi (Dhc) are key players involved in the complete detoxification of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) to environmentally benign ethene. While Smul is able to synthesize an unusual Nor-type of cobamide to sustain PCE-dechlorination activity, the genome sequence analysis demonstrated that Dhc strains are corrinoid auxotrophs and lack the ability for de novo biosynthesis of corrinoid, therefore, exogenous corrinoid (i.e., vitamin B12) must be available to enable and sustain Dhc reductive dechlorination activity. We re-assembled the cobalt-transport and corrinoid-metabolism pathways in sequenced Dhc genome and demonstrated the strategies that Dhc strain employ to rescue their corrinoid auxotrophy in pure cultures and defined co-cultures.

Three heavy metal-resistant strains of Mucilaginibacer rubeus and one of Mucilaginibacter kameinonensiswere isolated from the gold/copper Zijin mining site, Longyan, Fujian, China. These strains were shown to exhibit high resistance to heavy metals with minimal inhibitory concentration reaching up to 3.5 mM Cu(II), 21 mM Zn(II), 1.2 mM Cd(II), and 10.0 mM As(III). Genomes of the four strains were sequenced by Illumina. Sequence analyses revealed the presence of a high abundance of heavy metal resistance (HMR) determinants. One of the strain, M. rubeus P2, carried genes encoding 6 putative PIB-1-ATPase, 5 putative PIB-3-ATPase, 4 putative Zn(II)/Cd(II) PIB-4 type ATPase, and 16 putative resistance-nodulation-division (RND)-type metal transporter systems. Moreover, the four genomes contained a high abundance of genes coding for putative metal binding chaperones. Analysis of the close vicinity of these HMR determinants uncovered the presence of clusters of genes potentially associated with mobile genetic elements.

The results of scanning electron microscope (SEM) showed that the hyphae of P. oxalicum SL2 were thicker and grew better with the addition of Ca2+ and SO42- than those in the control group. Furthermore, regular shaped calcium oxalate crystals were detected in P. oxalicum SL2 mycelia in Ca2+ treated goup through electron dispersion spectroscopy (EDS) and X-Ray powder diffraction (XRD) analyses. Meanwhile, the results of X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) evidenced an increace of cysteine, cystine and glutathione (GSH) in P. oxalicum SL2 mycelia with the addition of SO42-, which might induce the reduction of Cr(VI). In conclusion, addition of Ca2+ could reduce the damage of Cr(VI) to P. oxalicum SL2 by maintaining the integrity of cell wall, and the transformation of sulfur from SO42- to cysteine, cysteine and GSH during restoration process was conducive to elevate the reduction efficiency of Cr(VI).

However, natural iron oxide and hydroxides display complex properties and morphologies without any possibilities to control precisely them that thus do not facilitate the interpretation in the mechanisms leading to TE adsorption. For this purpose, we developed novel synthetic magnetite nanoparticles (nFe3O4) as model carrier phases with a perfect control of their properties for a better understanding of the adsorption mechanisms of arsenic and copper elements. The synthetic magnetite materials obtained through the co-precipitation of both Fe3+ and Fe2+ ions (Fe2+ / Fe3+ = 0.5) were characterized by a set of complementary techniques: X-ray diffraction, transmission and scanning electron microscopy, Fourier transform infrared and Raman spectroscopy, and BET adsorption method. The resulting nFe3O4 display a wide specific surface area (100 m2 g-1) with particles reaching a size of about 10 nm, enhancing the immobilization of TE from contaminated waters, as it could be observed through adsorption isotherms obtained for various experimental conditions that mimic the natural context.

China b Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of Texas at Arlington, USA aritajam@163.com Anoxic-oxic cycles play a significant role on the forms and migrations of arsenic in groundwater systems, especially in those with high concentrations of Fe(II). Dissolved Fe(II) can absorb onto the surface (basal plane or OH-edge groups) of iron-containing clay minerals to form Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox couples. Researches showed that electron transfer could happen from sorbed Fe(II) to structural Fe(III) in iron-rich clays to impact the concentrations of As in groundwater, which leaves the inverse way [electron transfer from structural Fe(II) to aqueous Fe(III)] unknown. Therefore, we selected partially reduced iron-rich nontronite (NAu-1-PR) to interact with As(III)-Fe(II) solutions through anoxic-oxic cycles to test the above hypothesis. The methodology included clay/Fe(III) interaction under anoxic condition and clay/Fe(II)/As(III) interaction through anoxic-oxic cycles batch experiments, coupled with a series of analytical techniques (e.g., XRD, FT-IR, and XPS). During the anoxic experiments of NAu-1-PR interaction with Fe(III), the electron transfer from structural Fe(II) to aqueous Fe(III) added in the low pH value had been proved by XRD and XPS evidence, as well as change of aqueous and solid iron concentration in the system. In the anoxic-oxic transform experiment with the addition of both Fe(II) and As(III), aqueous arsenic stayed mainly as trivalent oxidation state in the anoxic process. When the system underwent oxic conditions, there was a sharp decline of aqueous As(III) in parallel with arising As(V) concentration. The structural Fe(II) fell off due to electron transfer from structural Fe(II) in clay to aqueous Fe(III), which is responsible for the oxidation of aqueous As(III) instead of the oxidation by Fenton action due to the added OH-scavenger. Therefore, it is concluded that electron transfer could happen from structural Fe(II) in clay lattices to aqueous Fe(III) and it is the driving force for the oxidation of As(III) to As(V) when an anoxic condition switches to oxic one.

Lead pollution is one of the more prominent environmental issues. Crops grown on land contaminated with lead not only limit their own growth and development, but also can transmit lead to humans through the food chain, posing a great threat to human health. Rice is one of the most important economic crops in China. It is very important to ensure the normal growth of rice and reduce the transfer of lead from root to aboveground. Chitosan (CTS) is widely sourced, safe and non-toxic. It can regulate the growth and development of plants and improve the ability of plants to resist stress. It is an ideal material for alleviating lead poisoning in rice. In this study, Guangliangyou 676 was used as an experimental material to study the effects of different concentrations of chitosan on the growth and development of rice seedlings under water culture conditions. At the same time, the effects of exogenous chitosan on rice seedlings under lead stress were discussed. The growth and development, physiological and biochemical indicators, hormone content, lead accumulation, and the effect of ascorbate-glutathione circulation system were researched.

The present study investigated the effectiveness of Chinese loess on Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb stabilization by decreasing their bioavailability in contaminated sediment. The loess was mixed with the sediment in doses of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 20 kg. Approximately 70 d after loess application, the effectiveness was evaluated using the Tessier sequential extraction procedure, single extractants (EDTA-2Na, DTPA, CaCl2 and HCl), toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP) and column leaching experiment. The results indicated that the loess can effectively transform Cu from the carbonate fraction into the residual fraction when the loess dose was ≥ 5 kg. Results from TCLP confirmed loess reduced leaching rate of Cu and Zn achieving up to 42.4% and 17.6% reductions, respectively, when compared with untreated sediment. The loess could significantly immobilize Cu and Zn in sediment, and the optimum dose of loess in 10 kg wet sediment was 5 kg. However, loess was inefficient for Cd and Pb immobilization. Correlation analysis showed that these four extractants and TCLP extraction method can provide a good indication of the toxicity of Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb in the amended sediment. Column leaching experiment showed that heavy metal in the loess-amended sediment migrated vertically, and the Cu concentration in leachate of the columns in this study will not cause pollution to groundwater within at least 7 years. These results highlight the potential for using Chinese loess as in situ sorbent amendment for sediment remediation.

Due to the influence of aging temperature, aging time, and impurity, it inevitably existed defects with different types and concentrations (e. g., oxygen vacancy defect) in manganese oxide, which may affect the fate of heavy metal in environment. Though many literatures have been reported for arsenic removal using manganese oxide, few works focus on the effect of defect in oxidation/adsorption of arsenic on manganese oxides. In this study, manganese oxides with tunable oxygen vacancy defect (OVD) concentrations are prepared by a one-step redox reaction between MnNO3 and KMnO4 at different temperature. The result of batch experiment of As(III) oxidation reveals that OVD has considerable effect on As(III) oxidation on manganese oxides. Increasing oxygen vacancy defects concentration in manganese oxide increases the specific As(III) oxidation rate from 0.12 to 0.22 μmol m-2 min-1. The origin of the tremendous effect of OVD on As(III) oxidation on manganese oxide is experimentally and theoretically investigated. The results reveal that the presence of OVD in manganese oxide not only makes the adsorption of As(III) on OMS-2 more favorable, but also accelerates the charge transfer from As(III) to Mn atom, thus significantly improving the As(III) oxidation activity. The present work provides a new insight into the effect of OVD in manganese oxide on the fate of arsenic species in environment.

Tana aCollege of Resources and Environment, Huazhong Agricultural University, China wangmx@mail.hzau.edu.cn Iron oxides is one of the soil active components and can adsorb external pollutants such as heavy metals in soil. Hematite (α-Fe2O3) is the most common and stable iron oxides in tropical and subtropical soils. Due to its various morphologies, small particle size, and relatively strong surface reactivity, hematite can act as a strong adsorbent for soluble contaminants in soils and sediments. Al-substitution in hematite is ubiquitous in nature and affect the microstructure of hematite and its adsorption properties of metal ions. Thus Al-substitution in hematite strongly affects the environmental behaviors of hematite. However, the microstructure caused by Al-substitution and its inner relationship with the surface reactivity of hematite remain unclear. In this study, the crystal structure of Al-substituted hematite was characterized by high-resolution electron transmission microscopy (HRTEM) and high angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM). Acid-base titration and Pb2+ adsorption experiments were performed to investigate the surface reactivity of Al-substituted hematite. HRTEM images revealed that the proportion of (001) facets on hematite increased from 44.0 ± 3.8% to 84.8 ± 6.5% with increasing Al-substitution. HAADF-STEM images indicated that Al-substitution resulted in more vacancies of Fe atoms on hematite (001) facets. At these Fe defect sites, additional singly (≡FeOH-0.5) and triply (≡Fe3O-0.5) coordinated hydroxyl sites were formed. The weight loss due to dehydrogenation followed the order of H-10 (6.2%) > H-5 (3.3%) > H-0 (1.7%). Besides, the relative percentage of surface oxygen atoms in the surface hydroxyl sites of Al-substituted hematite was consistent with the results of thermogravimetric analysis. At pH 5, the relative charge density of H-0, H-5 and H-10 was 73, 94 and 241 mC/m2, and their adsorption capacity for Pb2+ was 0.82, 1.23 and 3.51 μmol/m2, respectively. A similar trend was observed at pH 6. The results of pH-edge experiments further revealed that Al-substitution strongly enhanced the adsorption affinity of hematite for Pb2+. These results indicate that the formation of more defect sites with increasing Al-substitution can significantly enhance the surface charge density and Pb2+ adsorption capacity of hematite. These results also clarify the relationship between defect structures and Pb2+ adsorption of Al-substituted hematite and expand the understanding of the surface reactivity of Al-substituted iron oxides for various heavy metals.

Characteristics of the material revealed that Fe3O4 and CaCO3 were impregnated on the surface of the biochar. Batch experiments confirmed that the Ca-MBC had a high adsorption capacity for arsenic and cadmium in aqueous systems with maximum adsorption capacities of 6.34 and 10.07 mg g-1, respectively, and that the adsorption of both metals were pH-dependent from 2 to 12 with an optimal pH of pH 5. The mechanism of co-adsorption of Cd(II) and As(III) were both antagonistic and synergistic. A 160-day soil incubation was conducted to further investigate the remediation efficiency of heavy metals in soil. Following biochar application at the rates: biochar (1%, 2%, 3%) and Ca-MBC (1%, 2%, 3%), soil pH was increased and the bioavailability of cadmium was significantly decreased. The bioavailability of arsenic decreased, compared with the control, as the addition of Ca-MBC increased from 1% to 3% while the biochar treatments significantly increased arsenic bioavailability.

We further demonstrate through electron spin resonance measurements that superoxide radicals, produced from quinone-like groups within solid OM under irradiation, are a driving force in AgNPs formation. Our estimates indicate that solid OM contributes to about 11–31 % of AgNPs occurred naturally in soils. This provides a fresh insight into the sources of AgNPs in terrestrial environment and facilitates an unbiased assessment of fate and impacts of engineered AgNPs. The reduction role of solid OM is likely widespread within surface environment and can be expected to significantly influence the biogeochemical cycling of Ag and other contaminants that are reactive towards quinone-like groups.

The mechanisms of the binding and competitive adsorption of heavy metals on bacteria-associated clay mineral complexes have been poorly understood. Batch sorption, ITC, EXAFS and µ-XRF were applied to investigate the binding characteristics of Cd and its competition with Pb on montmorillonite (Mont)-humic acid(HA)-bacteria composites. Additive sorption and non-additive Cd(II) sorption are observed for the binary Mont-bacteria and ternary Mont-HA-bacteria composite, respectively. In the ternary composite, the coexistence of HA and bacteria inhibits Cd adsorption, suggesting a “blocking effect” between humic acid and bacterial cells. Large positive entropies, and linear combination fitting of the EXAFS spectra for Cd adsorbed onto Mont-bacteria and Mont-HA-bacteria composites, demonstrate that Cd is mostly bound to bacterial surface functional groups by forming inner-sphere complexes. The decreased coordination of C atoms around Cd and the reduced adsorption enthalpies and entropies for the binary mixtures suggested the transformation of bidentate Cd-carboxyl complexes into monodentate ones. Stronger competition was observed on clay mineral than on bacteria–clay composite due to more non-specific sites for heavy metal adsorption on clay mineral. Both competing heavy metals tended to react with bacterial fractions in the composite, which was verified by the higher correlation of Cd (and Pb) with Zn (R2 = 0.41) elemental distribution than with Si (R2 = 0.10). The competitive adsorption exhibited a lower entropy change (ΔS) at the metal-sorbent interfaces compared with single-metal adsorption.

However, regulatory effects of ABA on apoplastic transport in roots and consequences for uptake of toxic metals are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate how ABA regulates development of apoplastic barriers in roots of two ecotypes of Sedum alfredii and assess effects on cadmium (Cd) uptake. Under Cd treatment, increased endogenous ABA level was detected in roots of non-hyperaccumulating ecotype (NHE) due to up-regulated expressions of ABA biosynthesis genes (SaABA2 and SaNCED) but no change was observed in hyperaccumulating ecotype (HE). Simultaneously, endodermal Casparian strips (CSs) and suberin lamellae (SL) were deposited closer to root tips of NHE compared with HE. Interestingly, the vessel-to-CS overlap was identified as an ABA-driven anatomical trait modified in response to actual conditions. Results of correlation analyses and exogenous applications of ABA/Abamine indicate that ABA regulates development of both types of apoplastic barriers through promoting activities of phenylalanine ammonialyase, peroxidase and expressions of suberin-related genes (SaCYP86A1, SaGPAT5, SaKCS20).

For this reason, the Product Environmental Footprint Category Rules (PEFCR) of animal feed was approved by the EU commission in 2018. However, for feed additives such as trace minerals, the models of their production process are still being improved. As minerals are well known as the greatest contributors to ecotoxicological impacts, the feed industry’s commitment to generate data on feed additives will be important in the near future. The objective of this study was thus to develop a high-quality dataset for the potentiated zinc oxide source named HiZox® (Animine, France) in compliance with PEFCR requirements. Secondly, we compared our results with those obtained for other zinc sources: zinc sulfate and standard zinc oxide. The PEF study was based on the method as described in the PEFCR Feed for food-producing animals, and the experimental unit was 1 kg of zinc used in animal nutrition. The system boundaries were from cradle-to-plant, and the environmental indicators included all PEF impact categories, as well as the toxicity ones. The modelling was performed in the SimaPro version 8.5 and the latest PEF datasets and the EF method were used. The results showed an impact on freshwater ecotoxicity of 12 CTUe per kg of zinc supplied in the diet. For resource use, mineral and metals, the impact was 1.45E-03 kg Sb-eq. For other categories such as climate change and acidification (terrestrial and freshwater), the impact was 4.32 kg of CO2-eq. and 0.10 mol H+-eq., respectively.

This result could be due to the additional treatment of zinc-containing material with sulfuric acid in its production. However, after considering the animal production system and manure disposal in the boundaries of the LCA study, the results could change drastically mainly on toxicity-related categories, which strongly depend on metal speciation. As perspective, the speciation of zinc in animal wastes could be accounted in the LCA, providing a better assessment on the toxicity impact of HiZox® in the receiving environment.

It has been studied that the periphyton could significantly affect the behavior of heavy metals in water environment. However, the interactions between the periphyton and arsenic in paddy soil have been reported rarely. In this study, model paddy ecosystems with periphyton or not were built to explore the effects of periphyton on the bioavailability and transformation of arsenic in paddy soil. Further, the accumulation of arsenic in each part of rice were analyzed. Results showed that the periphyton on the surface of paddy soil could significantly increase the pH and decrease the Eh in tillering and heading stage in soil, but significantly decrease the pH and increase Eh in maturing stage in soil. The arsenic content in the periphyton fluctuated from 137.9 to 272.4 mg kg-1, resulting in a significant and substantial decrease in arsenic concentration in pore water of topsoil. Fourier transform-infrared (FT-IR) analysis confirm that the polysaccharides, hydroxyl (-OH), and amide (N-H) were responsible for arsenic binding in periphyton. In the maturing stage, the periphyton could reduce the formation of iron plaque in rice root and the content of arsenic in the iron plaque, but has no significant effect on the accumulation of arsenic in root and shoot of rice from tillering stage to maturing stage. The results in the present study suggest that the periphyton mainly affects the bioavailability and transformation of arsenic in topsoil.

Belgium considers poorly indurated clays as one of the options for geological disposal due to their low permeabilities and high sorption potentials. The Neogene sands could become part of the natural barrier in the Belgian radioactive waste disposal concept if a location in poorly indurated Boom or Ypresian Clays is chosen. The sands are characterized by glauconite contents varying from 20-80 wt%. Glauconite is a clay mineral that is aggregated by Fe(III) oxyhydroxides, forming green particles with average grain size of 250 µm. The objective of this study is to determine the 137Cs sorption potentials and sorption kinetics of the Neogene glauconite sands. Glauconite ((K,Na)(Fe3+Fe2+,Al,Mg)2(Si,Al)4O10(OH)2) is described as an iron (Fe) - potassium (K) phyllosilicate, comparable to an Fe-rich illite with K the main interlayer cation. Due to weathering, the mineral can evolve to a smectite-like structure with lower K content and a rim of oxides. Leaching the interlayer cations opens the edges of the layers, creating specific sorption sites for K+, caesium (Cs+) or ammonium (NH4+). The 137Cs sorption on glauconite sands was studied in a batch sorption test. The experiment was set up in a background solution of 100 mM CaCl2 and 0.5 mM KCl with a solid liquid ratio of 1 g to 30 ml. Initial 137Cs activity in the solution was 1.5 kBq ml-1. The evolution of the activity in solution was measured at different time intervals up to three months after initial spiking. Due to the strong competition with K+, 137Cs sorption is expressed as the radiocesium interception potential (RIP) or the distribution coefficient at a certain K+ concentration (KD.mK). A diverse set of glauconite sand samples was selected containing various weathering grades and glauconite contents. To evaluate the effect of the grain size on sorption kinetics, a set of samples was milled to an average 2 µm size. The KD.mK values of ranged between 850 and 4900 mmol kg-1 at 0.5 mM KCl after 14 days of equilibration for glauconite sands, similar to 137Cs sorption potentials in the Boom Clay. For glauconite fractions, the sorption potentials range from 3500 to 5500 mmol kg-1, comparable to illite references (Illite du Puy) with KD.mK of 6000 – 7000 mmol kg-1. The clay sized glauconite has larger sorption potentials that the unmilled grains. However, no significant differences in KD.mK were detected between large (>500 µm) and small (125-32 µm) glauconite pellets. The variation in KD.mK values among the different Neogene formations are limited, though there is a compositional diversity and a large difference in glauconite content. The 137Cs sorption beyond >3 months exceeded that of the 14 days point, this effect was more pronounced for the pellets than for milled grains.

Therefore, a typical high cadmium background region has been selected as a research area. Human exposure through soil, homegrown products, drinking water, dust will be analyzed and calculated, which will be intergated with the body burden indicator(urine cadmium content) and health indicators(NAG enzyme, β2-microglobulin, retinal binding protein )，human health risk in high soil cadmium region then was assessed scientifically. The results showed that the mean of male urine cadmium content is 1.46 μg/gCr，and female urine cadmium content is 2.09 μg/gCr，which showed a higher level than American (0.32-0.40 μg/L)、Canadian (0.24-0.39 μg/L)、Korean (male 0.66 μg/L、female 0.73 μg/L)、Japanese (1.3 μg/gCr). The female has a higher level than the male(purine NAG>urine RBP. When the urinary Cd level was 2 5μg/gCr, urinary β2-MG abnormal rate averaged 72.7%, urinary NAG abnormal rate averaged 31.8%, urinary RBP abnormal rate averaged 18.2%, indicating that environmental Cd exposure can lead to increased Cd burdern, and with the increase of cadmium burden, the abnormal renal function is more obvious. The index of urine β2-MG as the environmental risk assessment of environmental Cd exposure is the most sensitive than urinary NAG and urinary RBP, and it can reflect the damage of renal function caused by Cd.

Danga,b* a School of Environment and Energy, South China University of Technology, China b The Key Lab of Pollution Control and Ecosystem Restoration in Industry Clusters, Ministry of Education, South China University of Technology, China chzdang@scut.edu.cn Jarosite is an iron-hydroxysulfate mineral commonly found in acid mine drainage (AMD). For its strong adsorption and co-precipitation of heavy metals, jarosite is considered a potent scavenger for the contaminant in AMD contaminated-environment. Sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB) play an important role in the reductive dissolution of jarosite; however, the mechanism involved is yet to be elucidated. In this study, an indigenous SRB community enriched from Dabaoshan mine area was employed, and a series of batch experiments were performed to explore the mechanism for jarosite reduction by SRB. During which, different cultures, with and without dissolved sulfate; physical separation jarosite from the bacteria in culture by dialysis bag or not, were considered. Results indicated that the reduction of jarosite by SRB was via an indirect mechanism. In systems with dissolved sulfate, lactate was incompletely oxidized to acetate coupled with the reduction of SO42- to S2-, which subsequently reduce the Fe3+ bound in jarosite chemically, forming secondary minerals including vivianite, mackinawite and pyrite. In systems without dissolved sulfate, jarosite dissolution occurred prior to reduction, and similar secondary minerals formed as well. The extracellular polymeric substance secreted from SRB was demonstrated to be capable of facilitating the release of sulfate from the jarosite mineral to the solution. Structural sulfate in the solid phase may not be available for SRB respiration. Direct contact between SRB and jarosite is not necessary for mineral reduction to occur, though; wrapping jarosite into dialysis bag suppressed the reduction to a certain extend. Therefore, the mechanism of jarosite reduction by SRB is proposed as three key steps: (1) the microbial reduction of dissolved SO42- to S2- by SRB; (2) the chemical reduction of jarosite by S2-; and (3) the formation of secondary precipitation of mackinawite, pyrite or vivianite. This study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 41330639, 41720104004).

The universal toxicity of arsenic is depicted by the presence of resistance genes in the genomes of most living things spread across the three domains of life. Moreover, the expression of arsenic resistance genes in primitive prokaryotes near the base of the tree of life and in more recently evolved complex eukaryotes, suggest arsenic toxicity ancient and that it continues to play a crucial role in the organisation of the modern biosphere. Here, it is demonstrated that the concentration and redox behaviour of arsenic in seawater has varied dramatically through Earth history, controlled by climate, weathering fluxes from the continent and atmospheric oxygen content. The data show that it was not until 2450 million years ago that arsenate and arsenic sulfides rose to global prominence in seawater, coincident with the first permanent rise of oxygen in the atmosphere. It is proposed that it was at this time that the modern arsenic cycle was first established globally, triggering the onset of severe arsenate toxicity and competition with phosphate for uptake into cells.

We may assume that these specific features partially result from quantitative distributions of different macro- and trace elements in the plants. During recent years an impressive progress has been made in the understanding of the processes of uptake and pathways of various chemical elements in plants. It was shown that different genotypes may differ in the demands for mineral element supply and capacity of the element uptake, transport and involvement in the plant metabolism. Differences in the plant mineral nutrition have been recognized by both agronomists and molecular biologists. It has been assumed that each plant species has developed a specific element composition, and concentrations of different elements in a plant reflect first of all plant nutrient requirements rather than concentrations of the nutrients in soil. Different plants growing in the same place often have different concentrations of trace and macro-elements. It is important to remember that under ordinary conditions, each plant part may have its own characteristic concentrations of elements. Therefore, comparisons of element concentrations in plants may not be referred to the plant as a whole but should refer to the same plant parts (e.g. roots, or leaves, or seeds). Lastly, we may assume that not only concentration of one or another element in a particular plant part of any two plant species growing in the same environment may differ significantly but relations between elements in the plants may also be different. In the present work we compare different plant species grown both in a field and in greenhouse. The basic idea is that not only concentrations of organic compounds but also concentrations of macro- and trace elements in the plant species, and probably relationships between elements in different parts of the plants, may be different. The aim is to assess and to try to explain the differences and similarities in the ability of the plants to uptake and translocate different elements. We also studied relationships between various elements in different parts of the plant species, stressing the importance of not only organic but also mineral components as an additional indicator of the plant classification.

Many studies have showed the processes related to arsenate reduction, iron reduction can be involved in As release. However, the biogeochemical process of sulfate reduction in the high As aquifers is not clearly understood yet. According to the field groundwater investigation in Jianghan Plain, the high As(2550 μg/L) and low Fe(II)(1.5 mg/L) concentration were observed in shallow groundwater. However, previous studies indicated the As concentration showed positive correlation with iron concentration, which is related to the reductive dissolution of As-bearing iron oxides. Therefore, the microbially mediated sulfate reduction, as one key link in the redox sequence, may be equally important for the As mobilization in the groundwater, but this hypothesis remains to be tested. The purposes of this study were to 1) identify the effects of microbially mediated sulfate reduction process on the As mobilization and transformation; 2) discriminate the predominant process responsible for As mobility in high As aquifers with hydrogeochemical characteristics of high As and low Fe(II). We used the sediment samples collected from the monitoring well(YLW03) with high As and low Fe(II) in shallow aquifer at the depth of 20.75 m to design the 75-day incubation experiments under anaerobic condition. The results indicated that the intense sulfate reduction could indirectly promote As/Fe(II) release from sediments, which increased to 255.70 μg/L/3.53 mg/L, 285.00 μg/L/5.99 mg/L respectively in the microcosms with acetate amended and no amendment along with the functional gene(dsrB) copies increasing to 1.11×105/6.34×105 obviously. The sulfate reduction could also promote arsenate reduction along with the increase of arrA copies. In addition, the microbially mediated sulfate reduction also contributed to form thio-As (H2AsS4-), which could promote As release further. Initially, along with the relative abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria(SRB) including Desulfomicrobium increasing to 26.87%/30.58%, As released via the formation of sulfide, which could reduce the amorphous iron-oxides indirecty. Although the Fe-sulfide minerals formed simultaneously, they could not consistently inhibit the mobilization of arsenic. After 14 days of incubation, the relative abundance of iron-reducing bacteria(FeRB) including Geobacter increasing to maximum, 10.53%/16.70%, which could contributed to the poorly crystallized Fe-sulfide minerals and amorphous iron-oxides translating into pyrite and crystallized iron-oxides via iron reduction. Although a fraction of As was immobilized transiently, the As released into the liquid phase again then with the Fe(II) is scavenged finally. At the end of incubation, methanogens became predominant, which indicated the evolution of microbial community. According to those results, sulfate reduction play an important role on As mobilization and transformation in weakly alkaline groundwater. The sulfate reduction in in situ environment requires long-time investigation to better understand the sulfide-based immobilization strategies.

During the periods of anaerobic conditions, the bio-reduction of minerals containing ferric iron may induce the release of iron and several trace elements (TE), such as metals or metalloids that are associated to iron. The objective of the present study is to determine the mineralogical and microbial factors that constraint the kinetics of iron and TE release. It is also particularly interesting to determine if the nature of iron minerals influences the bacterial communities developed in contact with iron minerals, as biofilms. Complementary laboratory and on-site experiments were implemented to understand the interactions between iron oxides and iron-reducing microbial communities. The first phase of this experimental program included a characterization of biogeochemical parameters linked to iron reduction in riverbank sediments. The study site is located in Decize (Burgundy, France) near a Loire river channel. Three bulk samples submitted to different regimes of redox conditions were taken: soil from the dry river bank, flooded soil and sediment under water. First, cores were characterized using magnetic susceptibility, analysis of total carbon, total iron and sulfur, Raman and SEM-EDS. The iron-reducing bacteria Shewanella and Geobater were then searched in the different sediment samples using specific molecular primers. Samples from the three types of redox environments were inoculated in specific medium and three cultured enrichments of iron reducing bacteria were obtained that totally reduced FeIII-NTA in 1-2 days. Results showed that iron in sediments presented distinct oxidation states according to the water level. Some ferrihydrite was identified in an oxidized level by Raman spectroscopy, whereas iron sulfide globules (1-2 µm) were observed using SEM-EDS probe in a reducing level, suggesting dissolutive reduction of iron oxides concomitant to oxidation of organic matter. Additionally, Geobacter was detected in all soil samples but not the enrichments, whereas Shewanella was present in the soil, flooded soil and enrichments but not in the permanent aquatic sediment. In these iron reducing bacterial communities, Shewanella was present in higher proportion than Geobacter in enrichments, during the iron reducing process. The abundance of Geobacter may be linked to the type of iron oxide mineral.

However, techniques able to track these changing element profiles both in space and over time with appropriate resolution are rare. Here, we report a new technique, the Integrated Porewater Injection sampler (IPI sampler), which is designed for soil pore water sampling with minimum disturbance to saturated soil environment. IPI sampler employs a single hollow fiber membrane tube to passively sample porewater surrounding the tube. When working, it can be integrated into the sample introduction system, thus the sample preparation procedure is dramatically simplified. In this study, IPI samplers are coupled to ICP-MS at data-only mode. The limits of detection of IPIS-ICP-MS for Ni, As, Cd, Sb and Pb are 0.12, 0.67, 0.027, 0.029 and 0.074 μg·L-1, respectively. We assembled an IPI profiler using 3D printing to combine 25 IPI tubes in a one-dimensional array. The sampler array is able to analyze element profiles at high spatial resolution (~2mm) every >3 hours. When deployed in arsenic-contaminated paddy soils, it depicted the distributions and dynamics of multiple elements at anoxic-oxic transition. The results show IPI samlper is a powerful and robust technique in monitoring dynamics of element profile (>3 hours) in soil porewater at high spatial resolution (mm level).

Because Cd in chocolate originates from the cacao beans, the industry has set a concentration requirement of 0.60 mg Cd kg-1 dry weight for cacao beans. It is anticipated that this new requirement will have a large impact on the cacao market in South and Central America where cacao bean Cd concentrations are relatively high in comparison to cacao from other geographical origins (e.g. Africa). Indeed, recent survey studies indicated that 45 % of the sampled cacao beans in Ecuador contained concentrations of Cd higher than 0.60 mg kg-1. The aim of this study was to identify the Cd distribution within cacao bean tissues and the potential redistribution of Cd during fermentation. This knowledge may shed light on possible modifications in the extensive post-harvest process of cacao to control the Cd concentration in the final product. Currently only limited and often contradictory information is available regarding the localization of Cd within the different cacao bean tissues and the influences of post-harvest practices such as fermentation on Cd in cacao have not been studied to date. The distribution of Cd between and within the different tissues of the cacao bean (the nib or cotyledons, the seed coat or testa and the radicle), as well as the influence of fermentation on this distribution, were studied in the two main varieties grown in Ecuador: CCN-51 and Nacional. Cacao bean samples before and after fermentation were collected from a full scale fermentation cascade (200 kg) and a lab scale fermentation set-up (5 kg). Cacao beans for lab scale fermentation were sourced from a limited number of neighbouring trees to minimize the variation in elemental composition of the non-processed cacao beans. The elemental concentrations in the different tissues of unfermented and fermented cacao beans were analysed through acid digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis, and the distribution of elements within the cacao bean was visualized using laser ablation ICP-MS (LA-ICP-MS). Strong differences were observed between the elemental compositions of the different tissues. In unfermented cacao beans, cadmium concentrations were up to 70 % higher in the testa (Nacional 0.66 mg Cd kg-1 and CCN51 3.1 mg Cd kg-1) compared to the nib (Nacional 0.39 mg Cd kg-1 and CCN-51 1.8 mg Cd kg-1). During fermentation, the concentrations of most elements increased significantly in the testa of the cacao beans. For example, during full-scale fermentation of CCN-51 cacao, the Cd concentration in the testa increased from 0.60 mg kg-1 to 1.3 mg kg-1 while the Cd concentration of the nibs significantly (p-1 to 0.38 mg kg-1. Imaging of cacao bean cross sections by LA-ICP-MS revealed that the elements were heterogeneously distributed within the nib and testa. Particularly, a centre zone within the nib exhibited elevated concentrations of Cd and Cu but this zone was not visible for Ca, K, Ni, P or Zn.

Single-particle targets can be either nanoparticles or PM2.5/PM10, or synthetic ultrafine particles and clathrates, or the life-saving scientific research frontier cells, algae, viruses and other living small particle targets. Compared to traditional elemental methods, SP-ICP-MS technology is fast and efficient and provides more information: it can measure particle size distribution, number of particles, concentration of elements inside the particles, and concentration of elements dissolved outside the particles. Moreover, it is able to distinguish specific particles containing different elements. The SP-ICP-MS principle is based on measuring the signal strength and signal width produced by a single particle. The suspended single particles must be effectively diluted, with a certain interval between the particles to ensure that only one single particle arrives in the plasma of the ICP-MS at a time for high-speed cracking, then atomized and ionized, each particle produces a pulse signal in ICP-MS, and the width and height of the pulse signal represent the concentration of elements in the particle. The continuous signal represents the concentration of the dissolved element or solvent background element.When SP-ICP-MS is combined with a customized single-cell injection interface system and the latest data analysis software system, it can be used for single-particle analysis of algae, cells, etc. In this case, the technique is called single-cell ICP-MS. To ensure the reliability of the assay data, the algae or cells must be intact and bioactive before entering the plasma of the ICP-MS. Algae or cell granules can be up to 100 microns in diameter and can easily break or lose their vitality during sample transport, so the single cell ICP-MS injection system is tailored.

Sorption isotherm data revealed that Langmuir isotherm model fitted well with the experimental data which suggested that Cr(VI) sorption was dominated by chemisorption process. Kinetic modeling was also applied on kinetic experimental data and results described that pseudo-second-order model has given the best fit to the kinetic data over the pseudo-first-order model. The sorption process was significantly impacted by the presence of co-occurring anions including sulfate, phosphate, and nitrate; however, during the presence of sulfate, sorption of Cr(VI) was highly reduced (about 64.70%) compared to other anions.

Niemeläb and P. Perämäkib a Institute of Earth Sciences, St. Petersburg University, Russia b Research Unit of Sustainable Chemistry, University of Oulu, Finland shtangeeva@gmail.com Bromine is the 44th most common element in the Earth's crust. Bromides are commonly found in the environment along with sodium chloride, owing to their similar physical and chemical properties, but in smaller quantities. Bromine compounds were extensively produced and used for various aims over a long time. Meanwhile, it was shown that Br compounds are persistent in the environment, accumulate in the food chain and are of toxicological concern. The application of Br-containing chemicals resulted in increase of Br concentration in soil. Plants growing in the soil demonstrated considerable increase of Br uptake. Bromine is a new essential trace element for humans and animals. Although various plant species are capable of accumulating high concentrations of Br, its role in plants has not been identified yet. We can only state that Br is a constituent of all plant tissues. However, there is no real evidence to support the view that Br is concerned with any function in a plant. Thus, the question why plants have evolved the accumulation mechanism for Br as well as Br requirements of different plant species and its toxicity should be considered. The aims of the research were (1) to assess the response of several plant species to the increase of Br concentration in soil and (2) to study the factors responsible for uptake and accumulation of Br in the plants grown in the soil enriched with different bromides. The plants were exposed to three bromides: KBr, NH4Br, and NdBr3.6H2O. The purpose was to estimate effects of both Br- (as anion) and other components (cations) of the compounds on the plant development and nutrition. The challenge was to test can the cations additionally influence on the distribution of Br in the plants. The most negative effect on the leaf biomass was observed as a result of growth of the plants in soil spiked with NdBr3.6H2O. One might suggest that this was due to an increase of both Br and Nd concentrations in the plants. However, when the plants were grown in the soil spiked with NdBr3.6H2O, only roots of all the plants accumulated high concentrations of Nd. Thus, roots served as a natural barrier preventing transfer of Nd to leaves. It may be assumed that the combined exposure to Br and Nd was toxic for these plant species. The plants grown in the soil spiked with bromides were capable of accumulating high concentrations of The rate of Br accumulation, however, depended on the plant species. The highest concentration of Br was found in oat, and the least Br accumulation was observed in pea. The accumulation of Br also depended on bromide compounds presented in soil. All the plants accumulated more Br when they were grown in the KBr-spiked soil. Less Br was found in the plants grown in the soil spiked with NH4Br.

First predictions for engineered SiO2-NP concentrations in environmental surface water are 0.12 µg/L, and the mean concentration in soil is estimated to be 0.43 µg/L. Therefore, it is crucial to gain more information about the degradation of SiO2-NPs in the environment, which is currently scarce. Here, we present the results of a method development that was used to quantify the dissolution rate of SiO2-NPs in aqueous media. Silica was quantified using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) and a colorimetric assay. After initial tests of a variety of classic dialysis membrane systems, we adopted a membrane- free system. This allows direct measurements of the unaltered dissolution rate. To validate this setup, we quantified the dissolution SiO2-NPs at pH 11 over 72 h in parallel with a membrane-free and a classical membrane setup. The high pH 11 was chosen because of the known fast base-catalyzed hydrolytic degradation of SiO2 in this pH range. Using an initial concentration of 300 mg SiO2/L, complete dissolution was observed within the first 50 hours in the membrane-free setup. A pseudo-first order kinetics model d (t) = dmax (1-e-kt) fitted to the data, where d is the percentage of dissolved Si and k the dissolution rate constant. The model allowed estimating a half-life of about 10.2 hours for SiO2-NPs in Milli-Q water at pH 11. The particle dissolution was confirmed by TEM micrographs. We currently use this system to evaluate particle dissolution at environmentally relevant pHs. This study shows that membrane-free dissolution systems are a versatile tool to produce data for the fate and behaviour of SiO2-NPs in aqueous media, which is important for the regulation of this nanomaterial.

However, minimal research has been conducted on the remediation of HM contaminated soils in this region. In this study, a vermicopomst (VC) produced from vermicomposting cattle manure in a tropical rubber plantation was applied to remediating a tropical acidic soil in Hainan, China. The effectiveness of VC in reducing available HM in soils was evaluated by incubation experiments with spiked Cd, Cr and Ni or Cd contaminated field soil. The dynamic changes of soil physical, chemical and biological properties after VC amendment were determined to explore the mechanisms of HM immobilization. The results showed that VC amendment significantly reduced 0.01M CaCl2 extractable amounts of Cd, Ni and Cr in the HM-spiked soils. CaCl2 extractable Cd was reduced by 49% when VC was amended to Cd contaminated cassava planting soil. Thermodynamic studies showed that VC had a high adsorption capacity for Cd, Ni and Cr, with the maximum adsorption (obtained from the Langmuir model) of 33.45, 26.17, and 20.88 mg/g, respectively. The reduction in CaCl2 extractable HM after VC amendment was consistent with the order of maximum adsorption for Cd, Ni, and Cr on VC. Vermicompost amendment increased soil pH by 0.7 to 1.5 units, which is positively related with VC rate, but negatively with the decrease in extractable HM. These results indicates that adsorption of HM onto VC and an increase in soil pH after VC amendment are likely responsible for the decreased availability of Cd, Ni, and Cr in the contaminated soil. In addition, the addition of stable organic substances and subsequent formation of water-stable aggregates may be also beneficial for immobilizing HM and improving tropical soil quality.

When subjected to reducing conditions, these conditions can trigger the Fe2+-induced transformation of jarosite to more stable Fe(III) minerals, such as goethite with a rise in pH . There are many reduced organic matters in the wild which are able to reduce Fe(III) (oxyhydr)oxides to aqueous Fe(II). Because of the influence of organic matter，original reactant or the final product，in the system，the secondary Fe phases of Fe2+-induced transformation of jarosite may be difference comparing to adding aqueous Fe(II) directly. Also previous studies of the interaction of reduced organic matters with iron oxide have largely focused on the reactivity of the iron oxide, with kinetic equations used to describe the reductive dissolution process, there is little focuse on the transformation of minerals. Here we investigate the transformation of jarosite in the presence of cysteine to examine the impact of the naturally occurring reducing agent on such an Fe(II)-catalyzed transformation of jarosite. The transformation of jarosite to possible secondary Fe(III) mineralization products was identified using XRD, SEM, FTIR and TEM. Previous studies showed that the Fe(II) adding directly has resulted in transformation of jarosite to lepidocrocite and goethite via an intermediate green rust (GR-SO4) phase , but only lepidocrocite was found in this study. Further experiments indicated that this was possible due to the presence of cysteine disturbed the rate and amount of Fe(II) transport to the oxide surface, including formation of Ferrous-Cysteinate complexes and adsorption of cysteine，inhibiting the formation of goethite.

More and more bacteria capable of As transformation have been reported. In this study, a new As-resistant bacterial strain Leclercia adecarboxylata As3-1 was isolated and its associated mechanisms in As resistance and detoxification were evaluated based on genome sequencing and gene annotations. After subjecting strain As3-1 to media containing arsenate (AsV), AsV reduction occurred and an AsV-enhanced bacterial growth was observed. In contrast, strain As3-1 lacked arsenite (AsIII) oxidation ability and displayed lower AsIII resistance than AsV, probably due to its higher AsIII accumulation. Polymerase chain reaction and phylogenic analysis showed that strain As3-1 harbored a typical AsV reductase gene (arsC) on the plasmids. Genome sequencing and gene annotations identified four operons phoUpstBACS, arsHRBC, arsCRDABC and ttrRSBCA, with additional 8 genes outside the operons that might have involved in As resistance and detoxification in strain As3-1. Among which, 5 arsC genes were found, explaining why strain As-1 tolerated high AsV concentrations. Besides ArsC, TtrB, TtrC and TtrA proteins could also be involved in AsV reduction and consequent energy acquisition for bacterial growth. Our data provided a new example of diverse As-regulating systems and AsV-enhanced growth without ArrA in bacteria, which helps to better understand the role of As in selecting microbial systems that can transform and utilize As.

Phytic acid (PA) accounts for 50-60% of the total organic phosphorus in soils, thus it is especially important to accurately determine its content using lower cost techniques. Therefore, the aim of the study was to compare two commonly used characterization methods 31P NMR spectroscopy and enzymatic hydrolysis assay. The same anion exchange resin water, 0.5 M NaHCO3, 0.1 M NaOH and 0.1 M HCl extracts of tropical wetland topsoils was analyzed by two methods. The results showed that the phytate content determined by 31P NMR spectroscopy was higher than that determined by enzymatic hydrolysis assay. This may be attributed to that the extractant of the continuous extraction method also extracts organic matter from soils. Specifically, fulvic acid (FA) and humic acid (HA) can be extracted by strong extractants HCl and NaOH. For the enzymatic hydrolysis method, the effect of soil humus on phytase activity in continuous extract solutions and pros and cons with respect to ionic strength, cultivation time and PA:HA/FA mass ratio were examined. The results showed that extractable soil organic matter inhibits phytase activity, and even at low PA:HA/FA mass ratios, the activity of phytase was reduced by 40-50% compared to the control. Both organic matter and phytase were negatively charged, and the electrostatic repulsion between them affects organic matter polymerization. The hydrophobic action of humus increases with the increase of mass ratio, leading to the blocked electrostatic repulsion between organic matter and phytase, and the formation of polymer affects the active sites on phytase surface. The objective of this study was to measure the inhibition of phytase activity in extract solution and to attempt to establish a link with the quantity and quality of dissolved organic matter.

This bacterial species could reduce highly toxic and carcinogenic Cr(VI) into Cr(III). In this study, we investigated tolerance and accumulation of Cr(VI) and Zn(II) on protein level by proteomic approach. Arthrobacter globiformis 151B was grown at 3 following conditions: 1. with Cr (VI); 2. with Zn(II); 3. without Cr(VI) and Zn(II). Bacterial cells were harvested in a time dependent fashion (36, 60 and 120h after the starting of cultivation) and changes in proteome expression was analyzed using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) coupled with bioinformatics to identify proteins. Significant changes in protein expression included both up- and downregulation of different groups of proteins. Most remarkable changes were associated with metal-binding proteins and proteins involved in active transport. Parallel experiments with Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy revealed that reduced chromium appears mostly soluble and mainly associated with organics: especially with bacterial proteins.

Sorption isotherms and successive desorption tests of lead (Pb) were measured for three soils from North China (Chestnut soil, Lou soil and Black soil) following multiple freeze-thaw cycles (0, 1, 3, 6 and 9 FTCs) of -5 ℃ for 12 h and then +5 ℃ for 12 h. The results showed that lead adsorption dominated the sorption process in our soils and its capacity increased by repeated FTCs. The estimated sorption capacity represented by Freundlich affinity parameter, A (Lβ mmol1-β kg-1), of soils for Pb with multiple FTCs was linearly correlated with carbonate content in soils. The effects of FTCs on lead adsorption was more dependent on carbonate and clay contents than organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) and amorphous iron in soils. Carbonate-rich soil had the highest sorption capacity for Pb among three soils. Repeated FTCs increased pH values of soil solutions at applied Pb concentrations > 1.4 mmol L-1, which could facilitate specific adsorption for Pb in studied soils. Cation exchange could occupy specific adsorption sites with increasing doses in soils and it can also be facilitated by FTCs. Our results have demonstrated the great potential for immobilization of Pb by repeated FTCs through facilitating both formations of inner-sphere and outer-sphere complexes. Hence, these findings provide useful information on remediating Pb-contaminated soils in environments that undergo frequent FTCs.

Legacy mine waste and metal-contaminated environments can produce soluble metal(loid) nanoparticles whose stability and transportability is determined by particle composition and environmental conditions. The Coeur d’Alene River Basin of northern Idaho, USA, is impacted by legacy mine waste—estimated 56 million tonnes of waste rock containing 800,000 tonnes of Pb and 650,000 tonnes of Zn were discharged into the Coeur d'Alene River and its tributaries during mining of argentiferous galena-sphalerite deposits. This legacy waste-disposal practice produced substantial contamination of floodplain sediments throughout the basin. For this study, monthly water samples and sediment cores were collected along the shoreline of a metal-contaminated lateral lake of the Coeur d’Alene River. Porewater was centrifugally extracted from an upper and lower layer of the sediment cores to evaluate the formation and stability of metal nanoparticles during seasonal changes from the spring snowmelt to the return of freezing temperatures in the late fall. Substantial concentrations of Fe, Pb, Mn, and Zn were present in 450-nm filtered porewater during each month, but concentrations decreased following spring runoff. Nanophase metals with an average diameter of 200 nm were present in the porewater of the upper and lower sediments throughout the year. Nanoparticles in the lower sediment porewater were consistently more stable (more negative ζ potential) than nanoparticles present in the porewater of the upper sediments. These sediment porewater differences correspond to changes in sediment S speciation as determined by synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy of the residual sediments collected after centrifugation. The transport of these porewater metal nanoparticles was detected in the lake because of a change in the hydraulic gradient during a spring-to-summer transition that allowed the nanoparticles to move into the overlying water column of the lake. The presence of metal-carbonate and metal-sulfide minerals and seasonal redox conditions in the sediments of the lateral lake allow for production of stable and transportable metal(loid) nanoparticles throughout the annual hydrobiochemical cycle of this metal-contaminated environment in this northerly climate. This metal mobility because of nanoparticle formation creates an additional transport mechanism outside of free ion or sediment-bound metal transport.

Wherein the Cr(VI) removal subsequent to the co-precipitation was dominated by the sorption on Fe hydroxides. Although amounts of total sorbed Cr decreased with increasing C/(C+Fe) molar ratios, the reverse trend on Cr(VI) reducibility compensated the Cr(VI) removal capability of OFC samples.

Each substrate was immersed in acidic (pH 3) solutions containing aqueous Fe(II) from the dissolution of Fe(II)SO4·7H2O to simulate acidic, metal laden rock drainage. For static batch sorption testing substrates were placed in nylon strainers, suspended in acidic Fe solutions, and mixed using a shaker table while periodically monitoring equilibrium Fe(II) concentrations. Results of the batch sorption experiments indicate a sorption efficacy order of zeolite > functionalized silica fiber > bare silica fiber. Following batch sorption experiments, Fe(II) sorption efficacy of the substrates were evaluated under dynamic flow conditions through the use of a peristaltic pump to input acidic Fe(II) solution through permeable samples of the substrates, contained in 5-cm diameter PVC pipe. Zeolite consistently removed greater quantities of Fe(II) from solution than other substrates and was selected for development of a new passive and modular ARD treatment system. This new treatment system design consists of a series of interconnected PVC pipes and removable, zeolite-filled cartridges that can be assembled in the field. The goal of the new system is as a complimentary system for installation upstream of a primary treatment system to reduce the impact of variation in ARD conditions. The modular design allows for the easy expansion of the system through addition or refreshing of treatment cartridges to ensure sufficient contact time for effective treatment under possible variations in flow volume and metal concentrations.

Microbial transformations of Sb that promote precipitation and immobilization in situ, therefore, are promising strategies for remediation of Sb contamination. However, the knowledge of microbial Sb mechanism is still limited. The present study isolated three strains of Sb resistant bacterium from Sb contaminated soils, which were designated as B1, B2 and B3. With phylogenetic identification, B1 strains was of Ochrobactrum.sp, B2 and B3 were of Bacillus.sp. Among these three strains, B1and B2 showed antimonite super-resistant ability，with both of their MICs for antimonite being > 20 mM. However, the MIC of B3 for antimonite was 2O3 precipitation in antimonite solution. However, the antimonite detoxification of strain B2 was not implied in the present study. To date, the MIC of B1 for antimonite in this study was the highest among all the previous studied Sb resistant bacterium, and the precipitation of Sb was another important detoxification mechanism for Sb resistant bacterium.

Biochar (BC) derived from pyrolysis of biomass are increasingly being recognized as a sorbent for organic contaminants. The objectives of this study were to produce MSW BC form an organic fraction of solid waste and evaluate its potential for remediation of VOCs from landfill leachate while the reduction of MSW by utilizing as a sustainable option for solid waste management. The MSW was transformed into MSW BC by on-site pyrolyzer built at the Open dumpsite. The produced MSW BC was characterized for proximate, ultimate, and elemental analysis. For adsorption potential determination, batch sorption studies were conducted for ethylbenzene, toluene under single and binary aqueous media as a sorbate with MSW BC. Edge sorption was conducted for different pH (3,5,7, and 9) levels and kinetics were conducted for 50 µg/L sorbate for different time (½ - 24 h) intervals. Batch equilibrium isotherm studies conducted in different temperatures (25, 35, 45 °C) and range of concentration (10 – 600 µg/L) while, concentration acquired under the static headspace GCMS facility. The amounts of total sorbate ware being doubled for binary setup. The nonlinear curve fittings employed for isotherm and kinetics to obtain the mechanistic role of sorbent sorbate interaction. According to the proximate and ultimate results high temperature derived and lower polarity index [(O+N)/C] (0.26) exhibited highly carbonized structure indicated and it can influence the hydrophobicity and favorability of organic sorption. Furthermore, elemental results of the MSW BC presented are very low and tracer bioavailability of trace metals implies the sorbent suitability. Removal of both sorbate was increased with the pH and maximum observed at 9. Maximum adsorption capacities for ethylbenzene and toluene were in the single sorbate system respectively 476, 486 µg/g express under room temperature the maximum adsorption capacity of binary system was 514, 492 µg/g for the same sorbates. The entire systems depict the favorability of adsorption while increasing temperature. However, binary system demonstrate mutually exclusive sorption, and elevated ethylbenzene maximum sorption in all temperatures could explain hydrophobicity of sorbent favor and competitive for higher adsorption. Best fitting of both Freundlich and Langmuir reveal simultaneous influence of the chemisorptive and physisorptive behavior of sorbates sorbent interaction. Thus kinetic fittings more narrate towards chemisorption process in single and binary system. Thermodynamics results imply low and explain the nature of the physical interaction of all systems. This study suggests the potential of MSW BC for complex matrix of VOCs adsorption from landfill leachate and biochar as a sustainable option of simultaneous waste management and pollution control.

Heavy metal pollutants in the atmosphere cause soil pollution through depositional processes and pose a potential threat to human health. Jiyuan City in Henan Province, China produces about 900,000 tonnes of lead annually. Heavy metal contamination of soil and elevated blood lead levels (BLLs) of local children in Jiyuan have been reported. In order to investigate the depositional fluxes and time variation of heavy dust in the atmosphere around the lead smelting pollution area, atmospheric dust samples were collected for 12 consecutive months near a large lead smelter in Jiyuan City (YG), near an abandoned lead smelter faraway from the lead smelter (JLG), and from a place about 23 km from the smelter as the control (DZ). The average deposition fluxes of Pb, Cd, Cu, Zn and As at YG were 45.0, 1.62, 4.36, 17.52 and 1.61 kg·km-2·30d-1, those of JLG were 19.2, 0.382, 1.30, 6.64, 0.789 kg·km-2·30d-1, and those of DZ were 11.4, 0.116, 0.633, 2.43 and 0.252 kg·km-2·30d-1, respectively. Obvious variations in temporal depositional fluxes were observed for samples from YG, with lower deposition fluxes occurring from May to July and greater depositional fluxes occurring from January to February. These variations may have been due to changes in three factors: 1) rainfall; 2) vegetation; and 3) coal combustion for heating. Winter has less rainfall and ground vegetation and more coal combustion than in summer, thus resulting in greater heavy metal deposition than in summer. Results suggest that lead smelting in Jiyuan resulted in obvious enhancement in heavy metal deposition, with this enhancement predominantly due to fresh deposition from the smelter and to a lesser degree the resuspension of polluted soil particles. The greater depositional flux of JLG compared to the control indicates that soil heavy metals and other environmental components still contribute to air quality degradation even after smelting activity has ceased.

Twenty eight windowsill dust samples were collected from seven sampling areas in urban Jiyuan; five windowsill dust samples were collected near the Yuguang lead smelting facility to the northwest of urban Jiyuan; three control windowsill dust samples were collected from the DWL village, not affected by lead smelting. Soil samples were also collected where the windowsill dust samples were collected. Sample analysis indicated that: i) for dust samples from the Jiyuan urban area, Pb, Cd, Cu and Zn mean dust (10-45 μm) concentrations were 2540±455, 67.5±14.1, 306±11.4 and 2937±2492 mg/kg, respectively, while those of the >45 μm portion were 1079±430, 52.4±18.9, 203±59 and 2421±1853 mg/kg, respectively.

The current study was planned to screen the pH triggering effects of two Solanum melongena L. cultivars (cv. Chuttu and cv. VRIB-13) as well as associated plant physiological responses and ionomic profiles under Pb stress. Plants were grown in black plastic containers having nutrient solutions supplemented with 0, 15, 20 and 25 mM PbCl2 with a starting pH of 6.0. The pH and proton dynamics in the rhizosphere of Pb stressed S. melongena plants were continuously monitored up to 8 days. Plants were subsequently harvested and analyzed for different physio-biochemical and ionic attributes. Time scale studies revealed that cv. Chuttu and cv. VRIB-13 responded by causing acidosis and basification of growth medium during first 48 h of Pb stress, respectively. Up to 8 days of Pb treatment, both cultivars increased the rhizospheric pH except for 20 mM Pb treatment where rhizospheric acidosis of 0.125 and 0.15 units was recorded for Chuttu and cv. VRIB-13, respectively. Maximum pH increase of 1.21 units was recorded for cv. VRIB-13 at 15 mM Pb level and 0.8 units for cv. Chuttu at 25 mM Pb treatment. Pb toxicity signiﬁcantly reduced plant biomass, photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll contents, carotenoids and anthocyanin), ascorbic acid, total amino acid and total protein and the effects were significantly more apparent in cv. Chuttu than the cv. VRIB-13. Interestingly, the chlorophyll contents of cv. VRIB-13 increased with increasing Pb treatment levels. The Pb contents of roots and shoots of both cultivars increased with increase in applied Pb levels while nutrient (Ca, Mg, K and Fe) contents decreased predominately in cv. Chuttu. Due to antagonistic effect of Pb toxicity, the Na uptake and translocation from roots to shoot was also increased in both cultivars. Taken together, rhizospheric basification response, lower root to shoot Pb translocation and optimum balance of nutrients (Mg and Fe) conferred the growth enhancement, ultimately making the cv. VRIB-13 auspicious for tolerating Pb toxicity as compared to cv. Chuttu. The research outcomes are important while devising metallicolous plant-based strategies to remediate Pb polluted rhizosphere/soils.

Wua, S. Naveeda and C.H. Zhangb a College of Resources and Environmental Sciences, Nanjing Agricultural University, P.R. China b College of Life Science, Nanjing Agricultural University, P.R. China yingge711@njau.edu.cn Cadmium (Cd) contamination in paddy soils have become a serious threat to food safety around the globe as a result of industrial emissions, mining, wastewater irrigation, as well as fertilizers and pesticides applications. Rice (Oryza sativa L.), a staple crop for the world population, is especially prone to pollution of this hazardous metal because of Cd mobility in paddy soils and accumulation in rice grain. In addition, iron (Fe) is a nutrient element required for the proper functions in organisms. Unfortunately, its uptake by rice may be inhibited in the presence of Cd, exacerbating the problem of Fe deficiency and further threatening the human health. Therefore, it is urgent to search for approaches to simultaneously enhance Fe absorption and minimize Cd accumulation by rice. Sulfur (S) is another essential nutrient in plants and plays critical roles in a number of cellular processes, including redox cycles, detoxification of heavy metals and xenobiotics, and metabolism of secondary products. In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in understanding interactions between S and Fe, particularly the impact of S on the mobility of Fe in plants. On the other hand, it is well known that S supply affects the translocation and toxicity of Cd in rice through the formation of CdS precipitates, or complexation of Cd with thiol compounds such as glutathione (GSH), and phytochelatins (PCs). More importantly, nicotianamine (NA) is involved in the transport of Fe in rice phloem by forming Fe-NA and its biosynthesis is also affected by the S nutrition. However, the connections among S, Cd and Fe in terms of their distribution in rice remain unknown. Here, we hypothesized that S supply could mediate the competition between Cd and Fe for the entry to rice roots and translocation to stems and leaves, thus reducing the Cd accumulation while increasing Fe concentration in these tissues. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a hydroponic experiment, in which rice seedlings (cv. N07-63) were cultivated to examine the effect of S application on Fe and Cd uptake and translocation in rice under two levels of Cd (0 and 1.0 μmol L-1) combined with four S levels (0, 1.75, 3.5, 7.0 mmol L-1). Our data show that rice growth was suppressed by Cd but the toxicity was alleviated with the S addition, which also led to decline of Cd concentrations in rice roots, stems and leaves. Iron was deposited on the surface of rice root as Fe plaque, whose amount decreased with the increase of S supply. The Fe concentrations in all three parts of rice were lowered by the Cd treatments, but the S addition significantly increased the Fe levels in rice roots, stems and leaves. At the same time, S supply promoted the biosynthesis of thiol compounds and NA regardless of Cd treatment, indicating that S was involved in the complexation of Cd/Fe with these molecules and their movement in rice. Taken together, this study demonstrates that sufficient S supply is beneficial to rice by improving Fe nutrition and limiting Cd accumulation. More investigations are needed to reveal the underlying mechanisms for the interactions among the three elements in rice.

Bellengera a Department of Chemistry, Universite de Sherbrooke, QC, Canada jean-philippe.bellenger@usherbrooke.ca Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) is one of the most important biological processes on earth. BNF is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase. This metalloenzyme requires molybdenum (Mo) and iron (Fe) at its active center to reduce atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) into bioavailable ammonium. In addition to the canonical Mo nitrogenase, two alternative nitrogenases, using vanadium (V) and Fe-only instead of Mo are known to fix N2. Despite the discovery of these alternative isoforms more than 40 years ago, BNF is still believed to primarily rely on Mo. This reflects our poor understanding of the importance of trace metal dynamics on BNF activity and the concomitant question of the contribution of alternative means of N2 fixation, using V as metal cofactor, in natural and anthropogenic habitats. Here, I will first summarise the pilling evidences of a worldwide limitation of BNF by Mo availability. Over the last 3 decades Mo limitation of BNF has been reported in ecosystems ranging from tropical to subarctic latitudes, in both natural (e.g.., forest, tundra) and anthropogenic (e.g., agricultural soils) environments. The widespread limitation of BNF by Mo challenges current views on the importance of alternative nitrogenases to the global N budget. I will thus also summarise recent studies highlighting the ubiquitous distribution of alternative nitrogenase genes and the contribution of alternative nitrogenases to BNF in a wide range of ecosystems. I will then discuss how the contribution of alternative nitrogenases to BNF challenges our understanding of the role and importance of trace metal biogeochemistry on BNF. V has long been considered a toxic metal with limited biological purpose. Our understanding of V acquisition strategies deployed by N2 fixers to manage V limitation and toxicity remains elusive strongly limiting our ability to fully comprehend the biogeochemical cycling of this important, but mostly ignored, biometal. The widespread contribution of alternative nitrogenases to BNF also invites to re-evaluate N input estimates in many ecosystems. Indeed, the most common methods used to estimate BNF over the last half century (acetylene reduction assay) significantly underestimate N2 fixation by the Mo-independent nitrogenases and thus likely net N input estimates. Finally, I will discuss future research avenues and methodological developments required to fill current knowledge gaps in nitrogenase metal cofactors biogeochemistry, including V acquisition at the soil-N2 fixers interface, trace metal dynamics in complex biological communities (i.e., biofilms) and environmental factors controlling the expression and use of alternative nitrogenases.

Although the attention from the public, media, legislators, and scientists has led to some improvements in the area, there still remains much to do. The present talk aims (1) to briefly discuss the current status of legislations on the subject, and then (2) to discuss in detail the recent advances and updates in scientific research in the field. Regarding the legislations, some minor but significant changes have taken place both in the EU and the North American regulations within the last decade. Although the testing approaches differ between individual countries, a general tendency to adopt the ISO standards for testing children’s consumer goods could be observed. At the present moment, the problem of toys and children’s jewelry contamination seems to be moving from developed to developing countries possibly due to the fact that improved regulations and enforcement in developed countries lead manufacturers of these items to look for new markets with weaker regulations and/or enforcement. Several scientific studies performed within the last decade indicate that the problem of toys and children’s jewelry contamination is still present in different parts of the world; and, that the total concentrations of toxic elements in metallic toys and children’s jewelry is higher compared to other categories of children’s items. However, it does not mean that other categories of children’s items are safe. Bioaccessibility assessment tools remain promising and thus have become more and more popular for assessing the safety of consumer goods. Generally, the correlation between total and bioaccessible concentrations observed by researchers has been weak or non-existent, therefore, it may be suggested using bioaccessibility values instead of total metal content for risk characterization as well as for regulatory purposes. For bioaccessibility measurements, two main types of tests available are in-vivo and in-vitro tools. In-vitro tests bring several advantages over in-vivo such as their speed, having easier setup, costing much less, and avoiding ethical considerations linked to animal and/or human testing. Existing research areas and challenges in the field include Ag nanoparticles in consumer goods, contamination in vintage and second-hand articles, metallic speciation and its analytical investigation, and the question of reliability of popular rapid screening methods (e.g. via XRF) over classical analytical techniques (e.g. total digestion followed by ICP/AAS). *This presentation is intended to be the first part of the work to be presented by Prof. Guney’s team on contamination in children’s consumer goods and its potential adverse health outcomes.

Common bioremediation strategies involved in the removal of chlorinated solvents often establish suitable redox conditions that facilitate As dissolution and mobilization, but the effects of arsenic speciation on microbial dechlorination activity remain largely unexplored. In this study, we tested the activity of several dechlorinating pure cultures at the presence of varying concentrations of Arsenite (As (III)) and Arsenate (As (V)). As (III) exhibited more toxic effects than As (V) on the tested dechlorinating bacteria, and the presence of either As species significantly inhibited microbial dechlorination activity and resulted in slower rates and undesirable dechlorination end points. As (V) (5 μM and 50 μM) was quickly reduced to As(III) within 24 hours in a PCE-dechlorinating microcosm inoculated with aquifer solids. PCE-to cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cDCE) dechlorination was not inhibited, but the further detoxification of cDCE to ethene was slow and incomplete. In the microcosm amended with an initial 50 μM As (V), PCE dechlorination was completely stopped at the stage of cDCE and no vinyl chloride or ethene was detected. 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing results revealed that the abundance of Dehalococcoides mccartyi was decreased by 19.3% and 71.1% when exposed to 5 μM and 50 μM As(V), respectively, which is consistent with the observed loss in cDCE dechlorination activity. These results suggest that As con-contamination has a negative impact on the bioremediation of chlorinated solvents and the arsenic biogeochemical processes need to be taken into consideration during site restoration practice.

Inorganic arsenic is classified as a human carcinogen and chronic exposure of this can cause fatal damage to kidney, brain, heart, bladder and lungs of millions of people who rely on rice as a staple food. Therefore, assessing the bioavailability of arsenic from rice is crucial for understanding human exposure and to reduce the risk of arsenic-related diseases. In this study, an in vivo assay using swine was used to measure the bioavailability of arsenic from cooked rice of twelve genotypes grown in arsenic-contaminated field sites in Bangladesh. The average arsenic concentrations in each rice genotypes ranged from 108 ± 4 µg/kg to 580 ± 6 µg/kg. The speciation results indicate that inorganic arsenic contents varied from 73 to 99% depending on the varieties. In swine assay, different swine groups were administered with different arsenic species orally, by intravenous i.e. injection and fed cooked rice and finally blood arsenic levels were analyzed by ICP-MS (Agilent technologies) immediately after collection and arsenic bioavailability from rice was calculated by pharmacokinetic analysis. This study demonstrates that rice genotypic characters influenced arsenic bioavailability in rice grain grown in arsenic-contaminated areas and the bioavailability varied between 25% and 94%. Results indicate that arsenic in salt tolerant rice genotypes Binadhan-10 (25%) as well as brown rice genotypes Kheali Boro (35%) and Local Boro (40%) has lower bioavailability compared to other rice genotypes. Most commonly cultivated and consumed variety (BRRI dhan28) has arsenic bioavailability of 70%, which pose significant risk to consumers. Calculation of maximum tolerable daily intake based on bioavailable portion from rice was higher than those calculated based on inorganic and organic arsenic concentration. Thus, arsenic bioavailability from rice is cultivar dependent and can vary due to chemical form of arsenic. So, both genotypic characters and speciation plays an important role in arsenic bioavailability from rice.

The potential risk of Ga, In and Tl to human health and environment initiates us to screen soil microorganisms that are tolerant to Ga, In or Tl for future application, including bioremediation. In this study, soil samples collected from Taoyuan (PC and SK2 series) and Yilan (CI series) were used to isolate microorganisms tolerant to Ga, In or Tl. Bacteria tolerant to Ga, In and Tl in each soil sample were enriched in basal salt medium (BSM) supplemented with two different concentrations of Ga, In or Tl by transferring 1/10 volume to fresh medium (also supplemented with the same concentration of the same element) every ten days. As results,we obtained 44 candidate bacterial strains based on their colony morphology and the amount on nutrient agar after enrichment for 30 days. Among those strains, 23, 14, and 29 isolates can tolerate 200mg L-1 Ga, In and Tl, respectively. Additionally, five, four and twelve strains can tolerate only Ga, In and Tl, respectively. Seven isolates can tolerate both Ga and Tl, two isolates can tolerate both In and Tl, but none can tolerate both Ga and In. Interestingly, eight isolates possess ability to tolerate all three elements. Identification and characterization of these strains are undergoing. Further investigation on the resistant mechanisms of each candidate strain shall reveal how they can survive in the presence of high concentration of ECEs and then candidates for future utilization can be identified.

Wang, D. Zhu, Y.G. Zhu and Xi-Mei Xue Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China xmxue@iue.ac.cn Arsenic is the most ubiquitous environmental toxin and enters our environment in many ways, including weathering of rocks, mining, volcanic activities, herbicides, wood preservatives, feed additives and so on. Arsenate (As(V)) is the predominant species in the aerobic soils and be ingested and accumulated by non-target soil organisms via ingestion and dermal contact. Soil fauna is an important component of soil ecosystem, and its gut bacteria plays a crucial role in enhancing the host metabolism, health and immunity. Some studies have focused on the survival and reproduction of soil animals exposed to arsenic contamination. However, comprehensive studies of the interactions between arsenic species and the gut bacterial flora of soil animals have not been undertaken and relationships between arsenic species and ABGs in the soil fauna gut are not well understood. In this study, five important soil organisms involved in organic matter decomposition and nutrient turnover including the macrofauna (two earthworms) and three mesofauna (isopoda, enchytraeid and collembolan) were treated with arsenic. High-throughput quantitative PCR (HT-qPCR) with 80 primer sets (79 arsenic biotransformation genes (ABGs), and the bacterial 16S rRNA gene) was used to investigate the distribution of ABGs in different soil fauna. The gut microbial community was evaluated by using 16S rRNA gene amplification and high-throughput sequencing. The results showed that arsenic can be accumulated by all five soil animal body tissues. The profiles of ABGs in the gut of different animal species were various, though genes involved in arsenic reduction and efflux were predominant in all soil fauna gut. Gut bacterial community of soil fauna were significantly influenced by arsenic and animal ecological species. In addition, perturbation of gut microbiota can exert an impact on the abundance of ABGs. Our study characterizes the first time the distribution of ABGs in the gut of different soil animals and help understand the role of gut microbiota in the arsenic biotransformation.

Kanga and P. J. Chena\\ a Department of Agricultural Chemistry, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan, China chenpj@ntu.edu.tw Nanoscale lead dioxide (nPbO2(s)) is a corrosion byproduct, formed from the chlorination of lead-containing plumbing materials. This metal oxide nanoparticle (NP) plays a key role in determining lead pollution in drinking water and receiving water bodies. Natural water matrices with different salts or organic matters may affect aqueous redox conditions, thus altering the stability of nPbO2(s) or contributing to lead (Pb2+) releasing. Lead is a toxic metal that causes multiple adverse effects including neurotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, deleterious effects on the hematologic and cardiovascular systems. However, the interactions of nPbO2(s) with water matrices associated toxicity are less known. This study evaluates the aqueous chemistry and toxicological responses of nPbO2(s) associated to different water matrices using medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) as a model organism. The medaka larvae were treated with solutions containing either nPbO2(s) or Pb(II)(aq) in soft water with 5mg/L humic acid (SW+HA) or very hard water (VHW) for 10 days. At the endpoint, in vivo toxic effects, consisting of locomotor activity and neurotoxicity related gene expressions were measured. The result showed that dissolved salts enhanced aggregation and sedimentation of nPbO2(s) in VHW water. On the contrary, the presence of HA in water enhanced the particle stability and slightly accelerated lead dissolution. We observed that nPbO2(s) in VHW solutions showed higher interference in locomotor activities of medaka larvae, as compared to those in SW+HA solutions. Furthermore, genes involved central nervous system development (e.g. α1-tubulin and myelin basic protein) or acetylcholinesterase were downregulated with nPbO2 (10 and 20 mg/L) in VHW, as compared to the control. Our investigation indicated a higher toxicological risk (e.g., neurotoxic effect) of metal oxide NP (e.g., nPbO2) when they are present in hard water matrices of higher ion strength.

The Potassium to Sodium ratio is considered as an appropriate criterion for determining the salinity tolerant genotypes of barley. This research was carried out in order to study of agronomical and physiological traits in three Iranian Barley genotypes under farm salinity stress and also comparison of expression patterns of the genes involved in salinity tolerance of sensitive and tolerant barley genotypes at reproductive stage. Three cultivars and promising lines of barely (Afzal cultivar as tolerant genotype, L527 as sensitive genotype and inbred line MBS87-15 which was the result of crosses between Afzal and L527, as a tolerant genotype) were planted in a completely randomized block design in 3 replications under 2 different environments (salt stress and normal condition) during 2015-2016 in Agricultural and Natural Research Station of Neishabour, Iran (latitude 36°14´N, longitude 58°46´E, altitude 1,320m). Salt stress experiment was irrigated by NaCl solution with an electrical conductivity of 12 ds m-1. Salt stress led to significant decrease in seed yield, K+ concentration and K+/Na+ ratio while increased in Na+ concentration, prolin and froctan content, catalase and ascorbate peroxidase enzymes activity. Results indicated that tolerant genotypes Afzal and MBS87-15 had lower Na+ concentrations with higher K+ concentrations and K+/Na+ ratio in flag leaf blade compared to salt sensitive cultivar L527. Under salinity stress, seed yield was positively correlated with K+/Na+ ratio and K+ concentration. Increasing the expression of SOS1 gene in old leaves of Afzal and MBS87-15 cultivars indicates that the two genotypes are well suited for the exclusion of sodium mechanism in the old leaf that acts as a salt reservoir. In the flag leaf of genotypes, the expression of SOS1 gene was decreased. It is likely that in the flag leaf, where the sodium concentration is much lower than that of the old leaves, Barley plant uses sodium ion as cheap osmolite for osmotic regulation. The results showed that NHX1 gene plays an important role in the compartment of Na+ in vacuole, so that in the flag leaf of Afzal cultivar, the expression of this gene increased, but no change was observed in two other genotypes. Also, in old leaves of Afzal and MBS87-15 cultivar, this gene was expressed more intensely than the L52. The expression pattern of the SOD gene in the MBS87-15 was similar to L527 parent. While the expression pattern of Dehydro ascorbate reductase and glycine de-carboxylase genes in Afzal and MBS87-15 cultivars were similar. Generally, the results indicated that two genotypes of Afzal and MBS87-15 compared to the L527 genotype, exploited osmotic regulation ( compatible osmolites), Na+ exclusion and antioxidant defense mechanisms better than L527 genotype. So, it seems that, salinity tolerance mechanisms mentioned above have excellently been inherited from Afzal to MBS87-15 and after several generation selections for salinity tolerance, these mechanisms were stabilized in MBS87-15 genotype.

The purpose of this study was halophilic bacterial reduction of sulphate to remove iron and sulphate from very saline synthetic wastewater under anaerobic conditions to convert it to a chemical fertilizer for use in saline and alkaline soils. From samples collected from wastewater of cotton delinting factory, halophilic sulphate-reducing bacteria were enriched with lactate and sulphate in basal medium (Postage C) supplemented with 10% NaCl and 1% MgCl2.6H2O. Three strains were isolated and maintained in pure culture. Strain HSR 973 which showed the highest NaCl tolerance (up to 10%) consisted of motile non-sporulating vibrioid cells and resembled the genus Desulfovibrio. However, on the basis of physiological differences to all described species of this genus, strain HSR 973 was described as a new species and named Desulfovibrio halophilus, sp. nov. This experimental study was conducted in a biological reactor at anaerobic conditions. The iron was introduced into reactor at 50 to 400 ppm. The rate of sulphate reduction and iron removal were studied at retention times of 24 hours or more. All parameters in 50 ml samples were analysed using the standard methods for experiments of water and wastewater. After the adaptation of bacteria at different concentrations of iron, the maximum iron and sulphate removal at the optimum retention time of 24 hours were recorded 85.35 % and 78.3 %, respectively. Sulphate concentration in samples decreased to less than 20% after 24 h retention time. The maximum production of H2S at optimum operational conditions was about 228 ml/l. The results showed that the reduction of sulphate and iron biological precipitation by this method is acceptable. Alkalinity generated during the process can facilitate the system for treatment of acidic wastewater containing iron sulphate. The produced iron sulphide sludge was not suitable for use as a chemical fertilizer due to its lack of complete separation. However, the total sludge produced was able to be consumed in saline and alkaline soils for various purposes, including of pistachios growing in this area.

Returning of it to the soil, in addition to reducing environmental contamination, increases the soil organic matter and it can affect the uptake of nutrients in pistachio seedlings in saline conditions. In this experiment, PWC at three levels (0, 10 and 15 Kg) and soil containing spores of mycorrizal fungi at three levels (0, 100 and 200 g) was studied with three replications (each replicate included four seedlings) on Akbari and Badami Zarand cultivars pistachio as a split-plot in RCBD in Khorasan Razavi province – Iran, The results showed that iron, manganese and zinc concentration were affected by pistachio cultivars, so that the most concentration of iron (166.4 ppm) and manganese (60.7 ppm) were observed in Akbari and zinc (32.07 ppm) was also detected in the Badami Zarand cultivar. The maximum concentration of iron and manganese under interaction effects of cultivar and PWC was seen in Akbari and 15 and 10 kg of pistachio waste compost, respectively. The most amounts of potassium, iron and manganese was obtained in the treatment of 200 g of fungi with Akbari cultivar. In comparison with other treatments, the interactions of Akbari with 15 kg of PWC in 200 g mycorrhiza had the highest effect on the amount of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium with 2.1%, 0.12% and 1.72%, respectively. Also, Akbari cultivar with 200 g of mycorrhiza and 10 kg of PWC had the maximum effect on the leaf concentration of iron, manganese and zinc. The average amount of some elements in mycorrhizal treatments was more than the non-inoculated; as, it was observed 0.64 and 0.118% for phosphorus average, then iron with 152 and 86.3 ppm, and finally manganese with 53 and 18.6 ppm for mycorrhizal and non mycorrhizal treatments. But, the results were revealed that the combination of three species of Glomus mossea, Glomus intrardices and Glomus etunicatum was not efficient due to competition among the species of fungi and other native soil microorganisms. The mean value of all nutrients in PWC treatments was higher than the non-consumption. The highest difference was observed for average of zinc with 31.1 and 15.6 ppm, phosphorus (0.118% and 0.083%), and potassium (1.3 and 0.91%). Results indicated that the amount of PWC should be more than 15 kg per seedling to have a more effective influence on the concentration of nutrients in the plant in the water (12.7 dS m-1) and soil (10.02 dS m-1) salinity and their relatively alkaline pH (7.8).

On the formation of a chemical compound of water of the wetlands have influence as quantity (amount) of the atmospheric precipitation, so and their compound (including pollution). In turn polluted waters increase pollution of the soils and plants. High marshiness of territory of Belarus promotes formation peat soils. The researches have shown, that the most widespread pollutants of the peat soils are heavy metals: lead, cadmium, copper and radioactive caesium and strontium accumulated in plenties after Chernobyl accident . The capacity of the accumulation of heavy metals in peat soils is very high, but durability of communication is various: in the soils with a little ash and semi desintegrated peats is lower, than in the turbaries with high ash. The content of the carbonates in peat soils increases durability of fastening of heavy metals. The selective character of the accumulation of the cations of heavy metals is caused by features of hydration of the gymin acids. The link of caesium and strontium is defined(determined) mainly by carboxylic groups of gymin acids. The constants of stability has shown, that the gymin acids are vigorous complex formation substances much more exceeding complex formation of properties acetic, citric and other organic acids. The organic compounds can form strong insoluble complex compounds with metals at the specific values рН. At the same time heavy metals at formation of complexes with gymin and phulvo- acids get the big migratory ability. The study of accumulation of radioisotopes of strontium-90 and caesium-137 by plants has shown, that concentration of the radionuclides in the plants on 2-3 order is more, than in the water. The coefficient of accumulation of the radioisotopes Cs 137 as a rule is higher, than on Sr 90. Some differences in the coefficients (factors) of accumulation of strontium - 90 between plants on various soils are observed. The application of the fertilizers of phosphorus and potash reduced of the coefficient ( factor) of the accumulation of heavy metals in the plants especially at their joint application together with the microelements. CONCLUSIONS 1.The general law of allocation of total and mobile forms of heavy metals on genetical horizons of soils is revealed. 2.The study of ability of mobile forms Zn and Pb accumulate in upper organogenic horizons of various phylums of soils and ability of mobile forms Zn, Pb, Cu to concentrating on erect geochemical barriers on borders of change of genetical horizons of soils. 3.The influence of the total pollution of the soil by lead and by cadmium on arrival of heavy metals in plants is determined. It was established, that influence of lead at the presence of cadmium in soil on the vegetation of plants is stronger, than at contamination of the soil only by lead or only cadmium. 4.Are investigated of the forms of a presence(finding) radionuclides in podsolic sandy soil "}}

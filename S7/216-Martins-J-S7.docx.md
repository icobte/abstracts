<p style="text-align:justify">The fast mobilisation of inorganic pollutants by the colloidal and
mobile fraction of soils, and in particular biotic colloids (bacteria,
algae, fungi, virus, etc.), is now identified as an important secondary
transport process that can lead, under specifc conditions, to
accelerated and potentially dominant pollutant transfer towards
aquifers. The involved mechanisms remain howecver poorly understood. In
order to better understand the role of bacterial cells in metal
leaching, we conducted a coupled study under static and dynamic
conditions. Firstly we evaluated Zn and Cd metal biosorption onto active
or inactive Gram negative bacteria (<i>Escherichia coli</i> and <i>Cupriavidus
metallidurans</i> CH34) by characterizing the sub-cellular distribution of
the metals through a cell disruption approach. The quantification of Zn
and Cd in extracellular, membrane and cytoplasm compartments of the
cells permitted to show that metals are unequally distributed between
the three cell compartments and also between the two different bacteria.
Metals internalization appeared surprizingly to be the dominant
accumulation process of metals (high cytoplasm contents). These results
suggest that adsorption onto cell surface is only a first step in metal
management by bacteria and that bacteria can internalize important
amounts of heavy metals. The so-determined thermo-dynamic reactivity
constants were used to fit metal breakthrough curves performed in
natural sand columns. Transport experiments of bacterial cells, metals
or mixtures of bacteria and/or metals demonstrated that bacteria are
able to enhance and accelerate Cd and Zn transport in natural sand
columns. This transport process was shown to dominate metal aqueous
transport and was correctly fitted using a combined transport and
geochemical modeling approach. Altogether, these results show that,
under specific conditions, bacterial cells can increase metal pollutants
mobility in soils, which can be damaging for environmental quality but
also interesting in terms of soil remediation perspectives.

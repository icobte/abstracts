<p style="text-align:justify">The intense use of copper (Cu)-containing fungicides in viticulture is
causing an increase of Cu in soil, mostly in the upper layers, where
roots of young grapevines and herbaceous plants grow. This Cu
accumulation can induce toxicity and nutrient imbalances in several
plant species. The aim of this work was thus to evaluate the effect of
Cu toxicity on two grapevine rootstocks, Fercal and 196.17, and to
elucidate if intercropping with oat can alleviate grapevine Cu toxicity
using hydroponic trials and rhizobox experiments.

<p style="text-align:justify">The hydroponic trial revealed that root exudation was correlated with
genes expression (<i>VvPEZ</i>-like); furthermore the PCA analysis performed
on the grapevine and oat ionome revealed that both mono- and
intercropped 196.17 rootstock display a synergistic effect on Zn and Mn
in the root tissues at high Cu concentrations. An increase of Zn and Mn
in roots was also reported for the intercropped Fercal rootstock at high
Cu concentrations while an antagonistic relation was observed for root
Zn concentration in the monocropped Fercal rootstock. The rhizobox
experiments further confirmed these results showing a different nutrient
concentration at the root level depending on the rootstock (Fercal <i>vs.</i>
196.17) and on the soil (acid <i>vs</i>. alkaline). Indeed, Cu availability
is shaped by rhizosphere processes, which in turn depend on the soil
properties and/or the co-cultivation of different plant species (e.g.
grapevine and oat in intercropping systems). The soil-based experiments
revealed that the nutrient availability and the dissolved organic carbon
including root exudates differ depending on the soil properties and the
rootstock rather than on the cultivation system (monocropping <i>vs</i>.
intercropping). In particular, we did not observe any apparent
competition between the two plant species (oat and grapevine) in the
alkaline soil; on the other hand in the acid soil, the intercropping
revealed a beneficial effect reducing the available Cu in the
rhizosphere.

<p style="text-align:justify">Our results revealed that Fercal rootstock is be able to take advantage
from oat, while 196.17 seems disadvantaged by the intercropping system.
Yet, even though the intercropping system seems to be a valuable tool to
counteract grapevine Cu toxicity, the application of this agricultural
practice has shown to be species and mostly soil type dependent and
should be evaluated for each rootstock.

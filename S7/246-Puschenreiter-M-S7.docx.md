<p style="text-align:justify">Serpentine soils are characterized by high nickel (Ni) contents,
attributed to their particular geological background. This provides an
ecological niche for a specific group of metal-accumulating plants,
called hyperaccumulators, which have been investigated for a couple of
decades to identify the underlying mechanisms of trace metal
solubilisation, accumulation and tolerance. The influence of soil
characteristics on the Ni accumulation potential is still insufficiently
known. Therefore, a study based on field-collected soil and plant
samples was carried out for assessing the relationship between soil
characteristics and plant Ni concentration in the hyperaccumulator
<i>Noccaea goesingensis</i>.

<p style="text-align:justify">In the east of Austria two gradients of Ni concentration and soil
formation were evaluated, each consisting of three sampling locations.
On each location 6 plant and rhizosphere samples and one composite bulk
soil sample were collected and analyzed for their element concentrations
as well as physicochemical and microbiological characteristics. Standard
soil parameters (C, N, pH, CEC, etc.) as well as concentrations of
operationally defined Ni fractions were recorded (extracted by H<sub>2</sub>O,
Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, DTPA, and assessed by the diffusive gradients in thin
films technique (DGT)). Furthermore, the bacterial density and diversity
were determined for bulk and rhizosphere soil samples as well as root
samples. Functional bacterial diversity was assessed by cultivation in
Biolog EcoPlates<sup>TM</sup>.

<p style="text-align:justify">Along the first gradient, a decrease of total Ni as well as pH was
found, whereas organic carbon contents and CEC increased. Changes along
the second gradient were less pronounced. Characteristics of plant-free
bulk soil samples were correlated with shoot Ni concentrations. Among
the assessed soil Ni fractions in bulk soil samples from each sampling
spot, the highest correlations with shoot Ni concentrations were found
for water-extractable Ni (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.85) and total Ni (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.82).
Non-significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlations were found for DTPA (r<sup>2</sup> =
0.59) and Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>-extractable Ni (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.56). In rhizosphere
soils of all except one sampling location DTPA-extractable Ni
concentrations were higher compared to bulk soil values. No clear trend
was found for Sr(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>- and water-extractable Ni as well as pH and
Ni resupply (measured by the DGT technique).

<p style="text-align:justify">Bacterial density and diversity was higher in rhizosphere soils compared
to bulk soils. The diversity of root endophytes was lower than in the
corresponding rhizosphere soils. The density of Ni-tolerant bacteria was
significantly correlated with total Ni concentration (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.9, p &lt;
0.05).

<p style="text-align:justify">Our results suggest that total Nickel concentration in soil is the most
significant factor influencing plant Ni accumulation and rhizosphere
bacterial community characteristics.

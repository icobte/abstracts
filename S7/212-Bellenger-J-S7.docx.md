<p style="text-align:justify">Iron (Fe) is the most important metal in biology. Despite its abundance,
Fe is mostly present under ferric form in soils, strongly limiting its
bioavailability. To overcome the challenge of Fe acquisition, many
microorganisms produce siderophores to retrieve Fe from natural sources.
Another ubiquitous feature of bacteria in natural environments is
biofilm formation. Previous studies showed that external Fe strongly
influenced biofilm formation in several bacteria, suggesting that this
microenvironment could play a mechanistic role in micronutrient
acquisition for bacteria.

<p style="text-align:justify">Here, we apply a complementary set of analytical methods and deletion
mutants to evaluate the role of biofilm formation, siderophore
production, and their interaction, on Fe homeostasis in <i>Bacillus
subtilis</i>. We observed that Fe homeostasis, i.e. active growth at
constant intracellular Fe concentration, requires both siderophore
production and biofilm formation. Also, we report that in <i>B. subtilis</i>
both biofilm formation and siderophore production are required to
achieve active Fe acquisition from the medium, and to sustain normal
growth. Furthermore, we provide evidences that the formation of biofilm
slightly enhances the kinetics of Fe complexation by catechol
siderophores and markedly improves siderophore use efficiency.

<p style="text-align:justify">Put together, our results demonstrate a close link between biofilm
formation, siderophore production and iron acquisition in <i>B. subtilis</i>,
allowing a better comprehension of how <i>B. subtilis</i> can cope with metal
limitation in environmental conditions. These results provide new
perspectives on the mechanism underlying siderophore-based acquisition
of Fe in biofilm-forming bacteria.

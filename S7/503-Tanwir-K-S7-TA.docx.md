<strong>Abstract</strong>

<p style="text-align:justify">Cadmium (Cd), being a heavy toxic metal present in soil-plant system,
not only abridged the bio-availability of nutrients but also retarded
plant growth by instigating modulations in rhizospheric zone. The main
objective of present research was to evaluate the Cd induced variations
in rhizospheric soil and plant ion dynamics as well as <i>in planta</i>
physico-biochemical traits of two maize hybrids differing in Cd
tolerance. One Cd-tolerant (3062) and one Cd-sensitive (31P41) maize
cultivar was grown in soil spiked with 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 mg/kg
CdCl<sub>2</sub>. The plants were harvested at after thirty days of cultivation
and analyzed for various elemental, physiological and biochemical
parameters. The experimental soil samples were analyzed for different
characteristics before and after cultivation. The results revealed that
the maize cultivars were significantly modulating the rhizospheric ion
dynamics, when stressed by Cd. Cadmium toxicity in sensitive cultivar
(31P41) exhibited more prominent reduction in leaf area, chlorophyll
<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, carotenoids, root and shoot biomass, total protein contents
and catalase activity as compared to the tolerant one. Increase in
applied Cd stress significantly elevated the production of MDA, total
proline, phenolic content and production of antioxidant enzyme (SOD,
POD) in tolerant cultivar as compared to the sensitive one. The uptake
and translocation of N, P, K, Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Zn<sup>2+</sup> and Fe<sup>2+</sup> from
rhizosphere and root cell sap was found significantly higher in tolerant
cultivar (3062) in contrast with sensitive one (31P41) under Cd stress.
The summary of the outcomes elaborated that the Cd as a divalent ion
which compete with other nutrients and reduced there uptake and
translocation factor, which in response retarded the growth and
metabolism in maize plant. The results are more devastating in sensitive
31P41 as compared to the tolerant one. The translocation and
bio-accumulation of Cd point out the relevance of Cd tolerant cultivar
(3062) to be used in future remediation plans.
